As Alejandro Paul experimented with the strokes and curves of the monoline script Business Penmanship, he discovered interesting new forms and shapes that didn't fit the Spencerian theme of that typeface. These forms simmered in Ale's subconscious over the next three years, during which time he visited New York City, pored over rare type specimen books in the New York Public Library, and explored Brooklyn's neighborhoods.\n\n**[Brownstone](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000598)**, the face born from these explorations, is an original 21st-century design, yet one subtly infused with historical and cultural references - keen observers might spot influences from decorative typefaces of 19th-century foundries. And just as faces from that era were influenced by contemporary architecture, the frames included with **[Brownstone](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000598)** echo the ornate iron railings of Park Slope's row houses. (There's also a slight 1960s vibe to **[Brownstone](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000598)**, of novelty swash-sans photocompositing faces, that can be played up at your discretion.)\n\nInfluences aside, **[Brownstone](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000598)** has broad appeal to modern audiences. A soft, monoline sans-serif, with elements of Swiss geometry (see the 'k' and 'x'), its marriage of highly legible, draftsman-like letterforms with decorative swashes and ornaments reflects the old-meets-new aesthetic of the DIY craft culture seen in Brooklyn and other urban centers. It's ornamental but unfussy, romantic but understated - a design theme well-suited to recession-era cynicism.\n\nIndividual weights are being offered: **[Thin](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000599)**, **[Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000600)**, **[Hole](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000601)** or **[Complete](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000598)**. Also there is some options to get only the **[Frames](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000602)**.\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nABOUT THE **BROWNSTONE SPECIMEN**\n\n**[Brownstone Specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.sudtipos.com/downloads/Brownstone-Specimen.pdf)** in PDF format is available **[here](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.sudtipos.com/downloads/Brownstone-Specimen.pdf)**. It was written and photographed by our good friend **Jon Parker** who lives in Brooklyn.\n\nWhile we have been waiting for the release of the Brownstone specimen we did some **[\"Behance's sneak preview images\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.behance.net/Gallery/Brownstone-Sans-Sneak-Preview/461293)** of this one.\n\n[www.sudtipos.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409224109/http:/www.sudtipos.com/)\n\n",
