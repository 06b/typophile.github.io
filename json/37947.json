  "content": "For some reason, every time I open FontExplorer X - or restart my computer - it takes me through the setup assistant all over again. Furthermore I no longer have my sets, which took me hours to set up. It also no longer starts up automatically, nor does it load my fonts when I open a file (I now have to do this manually).\n\nI tried re-downloading the software and re-installing it, but the problem persists. I've emailed Linotype but not heard back. Has anybody else had this problem? Or any suggestions? If this persists I may have to try another font management software, which is a shame because I really like FontExplorer.\n\n",

I then use FontExplorer's smart sets to create sets based on the path to the font. it has been working very well for me, and I have a nicely organized backup of all my fonts.\n\nas for Suitcase, I dumped it myself. I had nothing but trouble in both QXP and InD with it. the primary problem I've noticed was auto-activation, but even without it I experienced much more frequent crashes in InD. I prefer to manually activate things any way so I know what's going on when I open a doc.\n\n"

After much hair tearing (and I don't have much anyway) and silence on Linotype's behalf, a last ditch attempt to rebuild this (system restore failed) was to change my visual theme. Reboot, then change it back to what it was. Amazingly this \"so obvious you'd miss it\" idea worked.\n\nMy personal experience of FEX - on XP at least - is that it doesn't seem to be quite ready yet. Maybe a reminder to try again in a few months or so.. ;)\n\nCheers,\n\nsimon\n\n"
