All the surveys are anonymous, and we would especially appreciate feedback from the font-conscious folks at Typophile.\n\nIf you have other comments not addressed in the surveys, please contact me offline, rather than post them here in this thread.\n\n[fonts.com survey](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417181613/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx%3Fsm%3DfCCZUpPq2kJ47hXx6eCccg_3d_3d)\n\n[ITC survey](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417181613/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx%3Fsm%3DfBX5QgtH8sVHZa_2bhemQllQ_3d_3d)\n\n[Monotype survey](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417181613/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx%3Fsm%3D6NbXA3oSjbE5yZZzRqzsjw_3d_3d)\n\n[Linotype Survey](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417181613/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx%3Fsm%3DNTTs3gXA2Y_2fITxO3BC4MfQ_3d_3d)\n\n",
