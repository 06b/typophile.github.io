  "content": "A german-speaking conference on “Typography and Literature” will be held in Berlin from Sept 25-27. The scope is mostly scholarly, but there is one typographer/designer mentioned in the programme: Friedrich Forssmann. Typophiles from the area might still be interested in the conference.
