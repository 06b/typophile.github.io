  "content": "Hello,  \nI tried several possible web services to identify the font but no one was able to help me. I'd like to try to translate a game (from Japanese but some parts have English text) so I'm trying to use the same font to recreate new text in the same form (all text was done in images).  \nI'd appreciate if someone can identify it.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [taa.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013185743/http:/typophile.com/files/taa.png) | 30.39 KB |\n| [taa2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013185743/http:/typophile.com/files/taa2.png) | 94.42 KB |\n\n",
