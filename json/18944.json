  "content": "In a couple of months, Sony is launching a new “eBook” handheld called the Sony Reader. The idea is that people will buy books electronically and read them on this device, rather than buying a printed book. I’m sure we can debate the theoretical market for such a device and whether it will actually sell, but my main beef with it is the horrific typography.\n\nI’ve attached a couple of Sony’s official media shots. The word spacing is sad, rivers galore, and why’d they try setting it all justified? And are we expected to read all our books in Times New Roman? (Particularly offensive are the undoubtedly faux italics.)\n\nHow does one contact Sony to help them address their, uh, issues?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090929043826im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SonyReader.jpg)\n\n",

I’ve tried to contact various people at Sony to see if they have any interest in licensing any of our types, and I’m sure other players (Bitstream, Monotype, Ascender) have tried as well. I think one of their issues is lack of a central typography group.\n\n"

They weren’t user friendly, and no single player seemed to catch on. The phenomena seemed like it would lag behind portable CD-players for some time.\n\nThen came the iPod. Say what you like about the product or its market share, I’m just pointing out that it brought MP3 players into prime time. Someday, there will be a similar eBook reader. Who knows who will make it… maybe even Sony. But not yet.\n\n"

Kanji doesn’t have serious problems with hyphenation, justification, word spacing, and doesn’t have a true italic. Therefore, it seems, those problems weren’t solved in this product.\n\nIf it’s easily hackable (I’ve heard rumors it runs some kind of Linux inside), I think I’ll get one. The physical device itself sounds pretty yummy, and I’m obviously interested in grayscale displays because FontFocus works in gray where ClearType does not.\n\n"
