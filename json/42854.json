Were I working on a restaurant I would check out every restaurant nearby and make sure that the type won’t by confused with competitors. It’s probably also good to make sure that the menu type does not clash with the food; I often eat at a place that serves a mix of flavorful American and French dishes and has a menu set in Helvetica, which just does not connect at all.\n\n"

A menu?\n\nJames has given you good advice, I’d just like to add if you are designing/working on the menu - find out what the age group will be frequenting the restaurant. Keep a style in mind for what their eyes can read... Also, how is the lighting at the restaurant? Older folks need larger type... etc. etc. etc.\n\n"

      "content": "Do anything you want, but when it’s time to design the menus, remember a few things: restaurants often have very low and uneven lighting, and people of every age go out to eat. Use a clear, conventional typeface, at generous size (10-13 point), and take advantage of bold and italic for emphasis. Print it in dark ink on light paper (no brown kraft paper). Customers will appreciate it, and waiters will be happy they don’t have to read the whole menu to people.\n\n"

If that’s an oxymoron, there’s some redundancy in your phrase :-)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSpeaking as a Typophile, the best menu I’ve ever come across was in 2005, Caffe Uno, an Italian restaurant in Norwich, England.  \nWe’re outside on the patio, under a tree in an old cobblestone market area (“Tombland”—not etymologically derived from graves, apparently) on a lovely summer evening, and the menu is tall and big, printed in letterpress Futura, on a laid card stock. Mmmmmm!\n\n"

You could indeed use Grotext, Sauna, Beaufort, Aichel, Mentor, Tyfa, Caliban, James Paul or any other legible face.\n\nLetterpress menus indeed sound sumptuous. Maybe the owner has a press in the basement. If I ever have a restaurant I’ll do that.\n\n"

You’d lose, what, like two people?\n\nThat said, typeface choice is still important because of the subconscious connotations that different typefaces carry with them. When Michael Beirut was asked in an interview about campaign design whether the average person could appreciate that Gotham is a uniquely American typeface, he admitted that not many people would know that as a fact, but that the typeface still carries with it a strong American vernacular. Papyrus carries with it thoughts of The Crocodile Hunter.\n\n"
