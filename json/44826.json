I have designed a new logo which is more organic and represents two entities that combine together (me + wife) that form an “A”.\n\nShould I keep the existing logo, or pick something new. If you see my Avatar, it’s a snippet of collage/ graphics that will be on one side of my business card. The logo and into text will be on the other side.\n\nI am attached to the existing logo and hesitant of the new one... I am getting sleepless nights over this.\n\nWhich one do you prefer and why?.\n\nThanks!!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [old.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011063456/http:/typophile.com/files/old.jpg) | 22.85 KB |\n| [new.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011063456/http:/typophile.com/files/new.jpg) | 21.79 KB |\n\n [‹ Monograms](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011063456/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44746 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Requiem or Trajan replacement ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011063456/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44861 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
