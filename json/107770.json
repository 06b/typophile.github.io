  "content": "long time reader, first time member and poster.\n\ni teach graphic design and typography at a community college in southern ontario (carl dair's hometown, in fact). we are in the process of revising our curriculum and i have been tasked with doing some research into the type design component of our curriculum. i thought the folks on this forum would have some valuable and usable input into our process.\n\nwhen i was at design school in the late 1980s, we had one minor type design project as part of our larger type design course (15 hours per week). but i wish that i had had more.\n\nso, my questions are :  \nhow much type design is appropriate/useful in a three-year graphic design diploma?  \nare there specific types of projects that you have found helpful in your own experience?\n\nthanks\n\n",

You'll probably get a better course by getting them to structure it.\n\n"
