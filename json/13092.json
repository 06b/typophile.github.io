The rights that Ultrafonts and myself are 2, by a contract:\n\n-By Ultrafonts patent; the exclusive rights of technology who generate greyscale render in truetype, for all the 6 fonts.  \n-By the typographer, the exclusive rights to own the fonts for full comercial use.\n\nBest.\n\nmh.\n\n"

      "content": "Miguel, the way I understand the contract\\*, unless Ultrafonts is involved in the licensing, I think our fonts are \"stuck\" at Ultrafonts... So a buyer can acquire some rights to the fonts directly from you, but he would have to keep selling them through Ultrafonts. Ultrafonts's co-ownership of the font files comes from the usage of their converter, and of course their patent. I'm talking about the TT outline fonts here; the actual bitmaps are indeed wholly owned by the individual designers.\n\n\\* Assuming they're all the same though - maybe they're not.\n\nIn any case, I hope you sell them for a good price - it's a nice collection.\n\nhhp\n\n"

To help clarify things, all of the original Ultrafonts developers are free to sell their fonts on the open market in any form they wish and the purchaser has all rights to resell, use or whatever else is stipulated in the contract between the font developer and purchaser.\n\nThe purchase however does not have any right to make their own Ultrafonts nor can they use the Ultrafonts name or trademark in the font with the exception of calling the font family purchased and Ultrafont.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nJose\n\n"
