What do you suggest? Something not eye-catching and sans-serif yet sleek.   \n   \nthank you very much\n\n [‹ Production Company Logo Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063431/http:/typophile.com/node/6738 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Number of fonts to use ... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063431/http:/typophile.com/node/6623 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

(the wording was a bit ambiguous)   \n   \nIf you do want a sans, i'd recommend Storm's [John Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063431/http:/www.stormtype.com/jsans.html) as both [Mrs. Eaves](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063431/http:/emigre.com/EF.php?fid=109) and John Sans are based on the Baskerville face.\n\n"

I don't see why you should discount signage!   \nBut seriously I agree with Kyle. A good, sturdy sans seems a more likely candidate for this type of thing than Mrs. Eaves.\n\n"
