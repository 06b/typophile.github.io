  "content": "In a nutshell -- I am trying to know where Flash CS4 gets its font name from.\n\nTo give more context; I have an .otf font file for ZineSlabDisOT, and the font name for this font is different on different Flash versions; as shown below to be precise:\n\nMAC Flash CS3 : ZineSlabDis OT  \nPC Flash CS3 : ZineSlabDisOT  \nMAC Flash CS4 : Zine Slab Display OT  \nPC Flash CS4 : Zine Slab Display OT\n\nAfter investigating this .otf file in a font editor, I found out that the CS3 MAC-PC name discrepency is due to the fact that PC Flash CS3 uses the \"Family Name\" of the font and MAC Flash CS3 uses the \"Full Name\"(each .otf font comes with five different names).\n\nI am running into similar font issues with Flash CS4. This time I am stumped because I am unable to find out where Flash CS4 gets its font name from; CS4 displays a name -- for ex: Zine Slab Display OT -- that doesn't show up any where in the font file.\n\nThank you so very much for your time, consideration and insights.  \nNeelu\n\n",
