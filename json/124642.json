In short, I am looking for a digitization of the Palatino typeface that is close to the original design.\n\nLooking at [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040631/http:/luc.devroye.org/palatino2.html) article, \"The original Palatino,\" I do like its liveliness and warmth. It seems to have been captured best by [Berthold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040631/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/)'s digitization (see [this PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040631/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/pala92.pdf) which has the font somewhat incomplete embedded) but that digitization is no longer available. There is the [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040631/http:/www.linotype.com/57056/palatinolinotype-family.html) version, and the [TeX Gyre Pagella](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040631/http:/www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/pagella) version, and [URW Palladio](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040631/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/palladio/). Which else? And which is closest to Zapf’s original?\n\n",

Look at those numerals!\n\nPalatino Nova may very well be the least authentic digitization, if you're looking for something that closely resembles the metal type.\n\nHas anyone digitized Palatino with the \"European\" (serifless) descender variants?\n\n"

It just doesn't seem to have the attention to detail that Berthold's has.\n\nIt makes me wonder: could one take Berthold's digitization and continue working on it? Legally, I mean?\n\n"
