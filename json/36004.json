  "content": "hi, there, I just found this community and am drooling all over right now over the wealth of info.\n\nQuestion: I am making a promo card for \"Minute Taking Made Easy\" workshop and am looking for a really sloppy handwriting font, that at the same time is extremely legible (to use as a headline). Looking for ink blotches, crossed over letters, scrathes etc. The postcard will also have a picture of a frustrated secretary on it.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nNatalia.\n\n",
