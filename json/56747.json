I’ve artworked most of them now, but am having problems identifying the fonts (have spent rather too long looking and can’t really see the wood for the tree...)\n\nThe first font is for the model name (Record in my case, but I believe it’s the same as this one):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091109221259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Reg_Pro_toptube_decal_3973.JPG)\n\nThe second font is from the crest on the seat tube (“Reg Harris Cycles Ltd England”), this one is driving me particularly crazy because I’m sure it’s obvious, but I can’t seem to get it (it’s a basic grotesk of some sort...)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091109221259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Reg_Pro_seattube_decal_1_5721.JPG)\n\nMany thanks in advance for all help,\n\nCrispin Jones\n\n",
