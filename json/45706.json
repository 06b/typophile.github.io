  "content": "Mário Feliciano's Merlo looks like a very useful set of fonts. Unfortunately, the Feliciano website seems to be down. The one time I got to it, I believe it showed 10 fonts in the family, for about $320 US. Merlo is also offered by Village for $120 the family, but the family is four fonts -- though the two \"expert\" fonts do include os figs & small caps.\n\nAnybody know what else comes with the family from Feliciano? In principle, I'd prefer the designer get all the money, but the iffy website is a problem.\n\nTIA, Charles\n\n",

      "content": "Charles, my impression from the Village web site is that Village is more of a cooperative than most foundries, and so each gets a bigger cut of the sales. That may be why Feliciano's web site has not been kept up so much.\n\nFrom the site:\n\n\"We are the union of eleven young type foundries who have decided to go it alone, together. vllg.com is the information channel and boutique storefront for this group of equals.\"\n\n"

It has more ligatures, dingbats, and several other important features like fractions.\n\nThere also differences in the vertical bearings and kerning:\n\nvllg:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020095746im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vllg_5649.png)\n\nfelliciano:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020095746im_/http:/typophile.com/files/felliciano_3949.png)\n\nHowever the version that he sells has alternates in the italics that I really love:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020095746im_/http:/typophile.com/files/merloalts_5447.png)\n\nAlso, Mario tells me there is an opentype version on the way soon. Hopefully all the features will be united.  \nUntil then, buy the Vllg version then request from Mario the version he has.\n\nI really love using it. Next on my list from him is Rongel. I really love his work.\n\nAll my best,\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"
