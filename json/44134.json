The justification for this is usually something along the lines of “people don’t like to read” or ”nobody wants to look at all that text.” As someone who has always enjoyed thick books with no pictures, I find these notions irritating and even offensive; I feel that the continuous success of mammoth books from popular authors like Stephen King and J.K. Rowling make it pretty clear that people really don’t need someone else chopping reading into smaller chunks.\n\nIs there really a good typographic reason for breaking text up more often than authors and editors might want? Or is this just a tendency of design professors and writers to throw in extra flourishes (and live vicariously through student work)? Or is it all just part of the trend of dumbing down some areas of popular culture?\n\n",

Something like a magazine article or an advertisement is trying to hold the attention of a reader who may not be particularly interested in the subject matter and is eager to skip ahead to the next thing. The designer has to try to coax the reader into taking a closer look, or, failing that, to get the reader to absorb some of the intended message just by skimming it before turning the page.\n\n"

I remember a design professor on a panel at a national meeting who said it was the designer's responsibility to challenge and excite the reader.\n\nI stood up in the Q&A session & said that if a designer wanted to \"challenge\" or \"excite\" a reader, he/she should write a book; those were the author's prerogatives. He replied \"Of course. The designer should check with the author.\" Perhaps fine advice in school; almost never happens in the real world. Should something like that be needed, it will be the editor, in conversation with the author, who makes the decision.\n\n"

Having stopping points may be an advantage for such uses. The New Yorker is more likely to run long text because it is a readers magazine and the writing is usually quite a bit better than the lifestyle mags that promote \"10 things your husband really wants (in bed)\" or \"101 best bars to pick up babes\". Magazines also have plenty of ads and jumps so the reader gets visually jolted around and has to resettle himself with cues like subheads.  \nBooks that are more a reference than a novel need subheads so that a person can find the section they are looking for easier. Things like \"Linkage adjustments on the 1967 Plymouth Fury\" may help the scanning gearhead find what he needs.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker get along just fine with a bare minimum of breaks and/or flourishes. That wouldn't work so well with Lucky or Us Magazines. The main thing is to recognize who your readership is going to be and what is going to best work for them. There are no hard and fast rules.\n\nWhen you get out into the real world, it is pretty rare for a designer or art director to overrule an editor when it comes to matters of text. You have to have a very good reason for doing it beyond \"it will look cool\". The last thing an editor or author wants to think is that \"people don't like to read\".\n\nI get pissed when I think the designer is being hostile to the text, as in a lot of Phaidon art books where the text is treated as a design element and frequently not so easy on the eyes. But from what I understand that is a rare instance of the art director getting to call the shots (as an editor there has told me).\n\n"

We cannot assume readers are willing to read the text, so designers use a variety of intermediate devices that either sell the piece or convey the main points without reading body copy--two-tier headlines (teaser big, info line smaller), pull quotes, section sub-heads, interesting captions. These devices supplement the main text by super-imposing a kind of outline that the reader grasps at a glance. The client wins when the reader gets the message so easily, or at least, when he gets the impression the agency is support-worthy, which is all the agency really needs. This is the justification for using such devices to sell text; in magazines it serves the same function. There's no reason to spurn this method, it's just a question of how intelligently you use the devices available.\n\n"

And, as has been stated repeatedly, it all depends upon the material, the audience, and the environment.\n\nCertain types of material (magazines or annual reports, for instance) do benefit from multiple entry points. A reader scanning a magazine may not be attracted by the headline or the topic, but might get hooked in through a photo and caption, or a pull-quote, or a subhead, and before they know it they're actually reading the text. Mission accomplished.\n\nFiction and other sustained narrative genres do not necessarily need these sorts of hooks, and in fact can be disrupted by the practice.\n\nMy experience is that good authors, editors, copywriters, etc., understand their genre and the tools of their trade. As such, the text will reflect what's appropriate and the designer should look for cues from the text and the editor.\n\nI have worked in environments where it is collaborative and I can make suggestions to the editor, knowing that we're both after the same thing.

First, you read things like the introduction, conclusion and table of contents to get an idea of the **structure**. Second, you skim the book by reading only the important sentences. You do this to get a more detailed idea of **structure** , to get something of the book and to determine whether to read it in more depth. Third, if it's worth reading in more depth, you read it front to back, and forthly, you may go into extreme detail through things like outlining.\n\nParagraph breaks identify the important sentences; the first and last sentences ofa paragraph are generally more important than the middle sentences. **Lack of necessary breaks and presence of unnecessary breaks both make skimming the book more difficult.**\n\nOnly a complete idiot would break paragraphs completely arbitrarily, so I hope there's some justification (hehe) for the breaks.
