      "content": "The Dutch g is pronounced in one of two ways,   \ndepending on who's speaking and where. It's   \neither the same as the German \"ach-laut\" in   \n\"Bach\" and the Scottish \"loch,\" or it's the   \nexact same sound voiced. The \"voiced\" part is   \nthe difference between the English k (unvoiced   \npalatal plosive) and the English g (voiced   \npalatal plosive). The ach-laut is an unvoiced   \npalatal fricative, and the Dutch g, when not   \npronounced the same as the ach-laut, is a   \nvoiced palatal fricative.   \n   \nI spent weeks and weeks walking around trying   \nto train myself to make the voiced version,   \nscaring lots of people in the process, and   \nwhen I finally got to the Netherlands, everyone   \nI heard speaking Dutch was using the unvoiced   \nversion. My time would have been better spent   \non Dutch vocabulary.   \n   \nAnother thing to watch out for is the ch sound.   \nIn German it's pronounced one of two ways, but   \nin Dutch it's only pronounced one way (the same   \nas the ach-laut, and never voiced.)   \n   \n--John   \n with an otherwise unused BA in German\n\n"
