It requires real sub-pixel text layout to make it work.\n\nRegarding ways to switch rendering modes, this is not determined yet.

      "content": "<cite>Sergey, can you explain how IE8 is rendering CFF fonts? Obviously it isn’t using the same Windows PS rasteriser as Firefox, but nor is it using the WPF renderer. It appears to be applying subpixel rendering (CT?) in the x-direction, but no y-direction antialiasing.</cite>\n\nInteresting. IE8 is using only GDI for text rendering. I have to look at this closer to understand what the differences are between us and FireFox. And I’ll prepare few screenshots showing DWrite in IE9, to show sub-pixel rendering of TrueType and CFF fonts.\n\n<cite>Based on the video presentation on Channel 9, I’m led to believe that DirectWrite will respect the current behavior of fonts - such as line breaks, word spacing, etc...<br>\nTrue? Not counting the inevitable edge cases - will it be essentially backwards compatible? Dare I say “seamlessly” so?</cite>\n\nI am not ready now to talk about compatibility story in relation to DWrite. The best answer I can give you is that we are aware of this issue and looking at it. At least there is an ability in Dwrite to use glyph metrics compatible with GDI. There are other aspects other than compatibility, e.g. transforms, animations, SVG, that make using subpixel positioning the best option.\n\nThanks,  \nSergey\n\n"

With some investment, TT autohinting could be significantly improved, raising the baseline and reducing the relative advantage of manual high-end hinting (with tools like VTT). The other thing that can be done is to develop auto-hint assistance that feeds into the manual tools, reducing the amount of expert work required to get to the best results. I've heard of multiple folks investigating or doing both approaches, but so far it's all proprietary (in the stricter sense of tools not being available to the public, not just that they're not open source).\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Open, proprietary, whatever. I'm just concerned about \"available\".  \nWhen Adobe tells me that they don't use Fontlab, they use \"in-house\" tools - well, why are they being kept in-house?  \nThey have every right to do so, of course. Just as MSFT has every right to keep VTT's learning curve high - as long as, I presume, they have access to people who've climbed that curve and can do the work. But that helps them, not me or anybody else.  \nAnd it leaves fonts in general looking that much worse.\n\nBut I'm glad to hear your opinion that a substantial improvement can be achieved. I'm hoping it's just a matter of time.\n\nrich\n\n"

The learning curve seems to me to be as high as the software demands, and isn't some kind of artificial construct. Also note that VTT represents a significant investment by MS in _reducing_ the difficulty of TT hinting, which previously was done by writing code.\n\n"
