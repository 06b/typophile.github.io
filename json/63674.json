I've tried fonts like Dante and Sabon but I think there might be a better match somewhere. I hope you have some good ideas!\n\nThanks, Jeffrey  \n [infraordinaire](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184243/http:/www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress/)\n\n",

It's brilliant, it fits perfectly, and they have comparable origins as well (originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton) which is nice. I've chosen the ITC Century because of the many different versions, and it seems to match well with ITC Franklin Gothic, probably because they come from the same place. Thanks all!\n\nJeffrey  \n [infraordinaire](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184243/http:/www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress)\n\n"
