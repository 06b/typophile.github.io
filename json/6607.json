      "content": "I call that \"uniwidth\". One of the MRF fonts (Delicato?) does this. Another example is the graded fonts at Font Bureau (although that's meant for compensating for gain, not for marking visible weight differences). And then there's the Hoefler display font series - Proteus Project. But probably the most prominent example is the Compatil system by Linotype - an amazing effort. BTW, my own Patria does it too, but only for the Regular and Demi weights, not the Light and Bold.   \n   \nI think it is -or at least can be- highly useful. The only problem is that beyond a certain weight range you have to start sacrificing the width/narrowness appearance of the whole to maintain the widths: the lights start looking wide and the darks narrow.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

So in a way not changing the weights is easier! Coupled with the fact that uniwidth _can_ be useful sometimes (like if you prefer to mark emphasis through weight change instead of italics\\*, and would like to maintain linebreaks\\*\\*) it makes sense - as long as you realize that there's a threshold beyond which the compromise to the integrity of the design (in terms of its characteristic width/narrowness) is too much. That's why Trinite (and Patria) only apply it to the Regular and Medium/Demi weights.   \n   \n\\* Like in TYPO magazine.   \n   \n\\*\\* Another place uniwidth is relevant is animation.   \n   \nBTW, Raph, there was once an interesting Typophile discussion about Sabon's constraints.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
