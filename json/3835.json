  "content": "There's an interesting discussion about [Greek](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022113834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Greek) fonts on Jon Coltz's hidden gem of a type site:\n\n[http://www.daidala.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022113834/http:/www.daidala.com/ \"http://www.daidala.com\")\n\nIt's always nice to see non-Latin coverage, but I have to strongly disagree with Coltz's assessment that Romulus Greek is a good design; on a formal Latin level it's great, but in terms of actual use (you know, like a font is made to be used...) it's like a transvestite shackled to Jabba the Hutt - ask any Greek (who is a Star Wars fan).\n\nBut if Romulus Greek was the abyss, the fonts from the 70s he mentions were the sides of the cliff. [Matthew Carter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022113834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Matthew%20Carter) -who was paid to make them like that by his Greek clients- himself had an allergic reaction to their inauthenticity, and made his [Cadmus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022113834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cadmus) font.\n\nFortunately, Greek type design has become its own person in the last decade or so. Hopefully other non-Latin scripts can learn from its mistakes and successes.\n\nAnyway, I don't mean to sound so negative; Coltz's piece is otherwise very timely and informative.\n\nhhp\n\n",
