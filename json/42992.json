One being designated the mark anchor and the other the base glyph anchor?\n\nThe reason I ask is that I’d like to specify how different accents build on one another, but at the moment with my font I get odd mixed results on being able to place two+ accents. Either they pile up as if the other weren’t there, or they stack up ignoring the anchors that I had placed, or they stack properly but the base glyph disappears. (this last one sounds like a bug in the Cocoa text engine).\n\nHowever, fontforge doesn’t seem to like the ida of two anchors, one to position an accent, and another to position any accents that would be piled on it. Am I going about this the wrong way?\n\n [‹ Combining Suitcases](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821150559/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42985 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Metrics works fine in Fontlab 5, NOT in WordPad / MS Word 2007 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821150559/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41146 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
