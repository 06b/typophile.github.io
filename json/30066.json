  "content": "My boss just gave me an unopened and unused Type On Call CD-ROM, version 4.0.\n\nSince the license was never used, is it still possible to request the fonts you get when you register? When I installed the software, it said that I could request Poppl-Laudatio Condensed and Apollo, both very nice faces, for the unbelievable price of $0.00!\n\nI can't seem to be able to get anyone on the line at Adobe, but I should be able to request the fonts, right?\n\n",

When you registered, you got a chance to call in and activate a selection of a few typefaces on the cd for free.\n\nSince it was never used, I suppose that the chance to activate the complementary fonts is still valid.\n\n"
