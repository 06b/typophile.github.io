  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI made a design project using Expo Serif Pro and Bernini Sans (a book and a website) and now I'm doubtful about which font to be used in the booklet describing the design process. The booklet is not part of the designed system, but it should be coherent with the rest since they are going to be presented together.  \nDo you suggest that I should use the same fonts or not? If not, do you have any recommendation for a coherent serif typeface?\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\n",

If they are related projects then using the same font families for both (and same graphic style) would help.\n\nIf they are unrelated projects then normally the fonts don't need to match. Unless you view them as \"related\" since they are part of the same presentation in which case a similar style for everything might make sense.\n\n"
