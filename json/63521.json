Both the font in the title and the text at the bottom of the poster.\n\n[http://www.libertyhill.org/images/2009\\_auction/2009/deadwood.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042804/http:/www.libertyhill.org/images/2009_auction/2009/deadwood.jpg \"http://www.libertyhill.org/images/2009\\_auction/2009/deadwood.jpg\")\n\nAlso, any suggestions for other fonts one would put under the category of \"Americana\"? (not saying the aforementioned font is one, but I would like any help.)\n\nthanks.\n\n",
