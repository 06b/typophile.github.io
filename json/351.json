      "content": "I _love_ the new keyboard editor, but I wouldn't recommend installing it unless you have a definite need for it and are willing to take some time to figure out how it works. I made a Biblical Hebrew keyboard this week, from which I can input all _nikud_ and _teamin_. Very cool.   \n   \nI will note that there are some bad presumptions in RichEdit that affect Office 2002, Wordpad etc. and which can cause problems with custom keyboards (e.g. some combining marks not being treated as such). It's an odd bug, because the keyboard is actually working perfectly, and is entering the correct characters, but they are not being processed correctly. You can solve the problem by using the keyboard in a plain text editor and copy/pasting it into the RichEdit application. I'm informed by MS that this bug is fixed in Office 2003.\n\n"

      "content": "_Is it substantially harder than let's say ResEdit?_   \n   \nIt is a visual editor, so probably easier for most people to figure out than ResEdit. You get a diagram of a keyboard, you click on a key and up pops a character entry dialogue. There are various ways to enter character codes, including typing from an existing keyboard, but I usually use the U+XXXX Unicode hexadecimal input. The aspect of it that may be confusing for some people has to do with understanding how keyboards work, and the relationship of hardware and software.   \n   \nYou activate additional keyboard in Windows XP by accessing Control Panel / Regional and Language Options. Click 'Details' on the Languags tab. This will bring up a window in which you can add a language and a keyboard/IME. There are two Armenian keyboards available, an Eastern and a Western.   \n   \nRichEdit is a system component for rich text layout. Wordpad is a RichEdit client, and I believe Office uses a custom version.   \n   \nI'm not aware of any reason not to install the .NET framework. In any case, it is going to be included in your next Windows upgrade, since it is a central element of Microsoft's new architecture.\n\n"
