  "content": "I don't know if this is already posted here, but I saw this when browsing the web:\n\n_\"Ecofont_\n\nThe prints we make for our 'daily use' not only use paper, but also ink. According to SPRANQ creative communications (Utrecht, The Netherlands) your ink cartridges (or toner) could last longer.  \nSPRANQ has therefore developed a new font: the Ecofont.\n\n\"After Dutch holey cheese, there now is a Dutch font with holes as well.\"\n\nAppealing ideas are often simple: how much of a letter can be removed while maintaining readability? After extensive testing with all kinds of shapes, the best results were achieved using small circles. After lots of late hours (and coffee) this resulted in a font that uses up to 20% less ink. Free to download, free to use.\"\n\nIt can be downloaded for free. To download and for more information, see here:\n\n[http://www.ecofont.eu/ecofont\\_en.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516060339/http:/www.ecofont.eu/ecofont_en.html)\n\nWhat do you guys think of it?\n\nKind regards,  \nMartijn\n\n",

I'm sure there are plenty of examples of characters with holes in them — see an inverted Rosewood for example. Sure, the font file itself is their intellectual property, but you can't copyright a idea (at least under US law). It is like building a car. You can design a car to be environmentally friendly, but that doesn't stop another car maker from trying to make an environmentally friendly car too. In fact, an article on TypeRight seems to back up this line of thought [http://www.typeright.org/feature4.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516060339/http:/www.typeright.org/feature4.html \"http://www.typeright.org/feature4.html\").\n\nOf course, as you said, the wording appears to be gone from their site, so maybe they realized they couldn't enforce it. Nick is probably safe :)\n\n"
