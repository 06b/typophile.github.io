  "content": "Hi all\n\nI have to single master fonts, to combine into a multiple master.\n\nAs the the first time building a mm font, i'm still having some trouble understanding how do i check compatibility between the two masters i built, using the assign master operation... Can i expect that the outine nodes are linked in both masters after assigning the new master? Should i use the match masters action to check if their outlines are compatible?\n\nI also checked the \"convert hints to links\" when defining the weight axis. Should i use manual interpolation when two outlines are incompatible?\n\nMaybe it depends on the situation, but what would be the best (or most used) method to create the master font: using the blend feature, the mask to master action, or with the assign new master command?\n\nSorry for posting so many questions  \nThanks in advance\n\nRegards\n\n",
