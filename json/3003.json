Which means you need to look around a bit and see what's out there in the nooks and crannies, but that can be gobs of fun too. And we can certainly help! :-)   \n   \nBTW, if you will be doing screen-based (and not just print-based) design, check out this:   \n [http://www.ultrafonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621112212/http:/www.ultrafonts.com/)   \nThe entire library of high-quality and highly progressive designs would barely put a dent in your budget!   \n   \nHappy shopping.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

In a library that size, there's bound to be some... well, some lesser works, but there's tons of quality there, and lots of utility in their OpenType implementation.   \n   \nThe faces with optical variations are very useful. They give those of us mourning the decline of Multiple Masters some comfort.   \n   \nWhether you get the Folio or individual sets is a matter for you, your taste, and your calculator.   \n   \nI agree that you should look at the Storm fonts. Great value for unusual faces.   \n   \nLinotype's Optima Nova is well worth a look, and you should look for some of Matthew Carter's faces.   \n   \nAnother thing to consider when looking at different foundries is their licensing conditions: some allow embedding in PDFs, some don't, some allow modifications of the fonts for in-house use, some don't, that sort of thing.   \n   \nMost foundries that don't include embedding in their standard EULA will allow it under separate licensing, but you should check all that up front.

There are no OpenType fonts there, but many quality digitizations of classic faces. The typefaces are renamed but e.g. for Linotype faces, the designes are licensed.   \n   \nThe digital versions of Bitstream fonts are really superb. For example, I think their Futura is better than Adobe's or URW's. In many cases, I consider the Bitstream digital versions better than the ones with the original names. After all, the initial digitization of the Bitstream type library was supervised by Matthew Carter.   \n   \nYou don't like ITC faces so you'll live with the fact that Bitstream no longer has the license to distribute their digitizations of ITC fonts, and they are not included on Type Odyssey.   \n   \nOn the other hand: probably the best way to get a huge load of Bitstream and ITC fonts probably is to buy Corel DRAW 9 on eBay. :D   \nYou can get a copy for $20 and it includes an incredible collection of fonts: over 1000 Western fonts from Bitstream and URW, plus a set of international fonts (Cyrillic, CE, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic).   \n   \nOf course, Type Odyssey 2 contains quite a few new faces from other foundries, and it may be the reason the get the library.   \n   \nI'd also pay attention to the ParaType library:   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/url?3967302fb3976b83a34d82d8464b7a79](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621112212/http:/www.myfonts.com/url?3967302fb3976b83a34d82d8464b7a79)   \nSome of their fonts are Unicode with great hand hinting, and all of them are available in Western, CE and Cyrillic encodings. They have very fine licensed versions of Bitstream fonts, and quite a few original designs.   \n   \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "m-ga,   \n   \nthe Bitstream situation goes roughly as follows: in the 1980s, Linotype was still a large print machines manufacturer who was not interested in making digital fonts for the slowly emerging DTP market. A group of type designers including Matthew Carter left Linotype and started Bitstream, which was to become the first digital type foundry in the world. They digitized original Linotype typefaces, but Linotype refused to license the original trademarks to them. So they used names derived from their own classification (Humanist 777 being Frutiger, Swiss 721 being Helvetica, etc.). Bitstream licensed the names from some other foundries, so some of the fonts used original names (e.g. Futura), but those copied from Linotype, Monotype and Berthold designs usually did not. However, these still were very faithful and high-quality digitizations, not cheap knock-offs like many many other companies offered them.   \n   \nSome time later, the original team left Bitstream. At this time, the company signed the unfortunate deal with Corel so that nearly the entire Bitstream type library (850 fonts or so) shipped with Corel DRAW starting from version 4.0.   \n   \nOver the time, Bitstream's policy towards other vendors and designers matured, and when Jim Lyles took over the maintainence of the Bitstream type library, they started releasing new designs as Bitstream New Font Collection. They also added the euro character to their old fonts, of course.   \n   \nSo the Bitstream Type Odyssey includes a large portion (~850 fonts I think) of the original library and some 600 fonts that are new designs, released by Bitstream or licensed from other foundries.   \n   \nYou can browse the contnets of Type Odyssey 2 here: [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/product/type-odyssey-2-mac/?mode=alpha](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621112212/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/product/type-odyssey-2-mac/?mode=alpha)   \n   \nLast year, Linotype and Bitstream signed an agreement which finally ended their dispute over the designs. Linotype officially \"licensed\" the designs to Bitstream (but not the trademarks). This means, that prior to that, Swiss 721 was an unlicensed clone of Helvetica, and now it's a licensed version of Helvetica, but sold under a different name. The press release is here: [http://www.bitstream.com/categories/news/press/2003\\_bitstream/071803\\_linotype.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621112212/http:/www.bitstream.com/categories/news/press/2003_bitstream/071803_linotype.html)  \n   \nThis is handy to know as this sort of confirms that the Bitstream versions really are derived from the same original sources.   \n   \nBest,   \nAdam\n\n"

Bitstream came about because Mike Parker struck a deal to provide copies of Linotype fonts to a client who couldn't license from Linotype. This client provided the startup investment for Bitstream, and Mike jumped ship from Linotype, taking Matthew Carter and David Berlow with him. That, at least, is Mike's account.\n\n"

You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Bitstream Product without Bitstream's prior written consent. \"   \n   \nIf the license did not prohibit this, you would normally be allowed to put any trademarked name into the font provided they are for your use only. However, IMO this is impractical and may cause confusion. Note that the original fonts are QA'ed until get-no so I wouldn't want to modify them unless I really need to.   \n   \nOn a related matter, the Linotype EULA is more liberal with regard to modification: \"You may modify the Font-Software to satisfy your design requirements. Such modifications are in every respect subject to this Font-Software License Agreement. \"   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/viewlicense?id=8](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621112212/http:/www.myfonts.com/viewlicense?id=8)   \n   \nAs for the digitizations: for many of the older designs, there is no \"one master design\". These often were work in progress, evolving in the designer's mind and constantly adapted to match various technological requirements. Some typefaces have undergone such major revisions that the current versions barely look similar to the initial ones. Best example: Palatino. Current Palatino Linotype is a heavily simiplified text version, Berthold's version captures the display style of the initial drawings. Bitstream's Zapf Humanist 801 is somewhere in-between I think.   \n   \nSo in some cases, different artwork from different periods was used by different companies to prepare the digitizations. Also, most digitizations involve adaptation, so the person who art-directed the digital version also has an influence on the final look.   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam\n\n"

There are tentative plans to redesign some of the others, but this is a low priority.\n\n"

In effect there is a moratorium on typographers using new typefaces. The general preference is for retro scripts and mid 20th century faces (mainly sans). The other stultifying factor is the preponderance of bland, utilitarian fonts given away by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe with their software apps.   \n   \nSo yes, I would say that public sector organizations owe no fealty to mainstream corporate culture, and the affinity of bureaucracies is a powerful attraction between the two, but it should be resisted by free-thinking individuals.   \n   \nWhy is a public sector organisation prefering to buy from a small, independent foundry considered to be a \"charitable donation\"?

Bitstream was, apparently, the first company to make and license digital fonts without also selling you the machine.   \n   \nSo Bitstream was instrumental in both the largest single act of font piracy in history, and the collapse of an industry that stopped making the one thing that made it a lot of money. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621112212im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

However, the requirement to transmit in Word format means that the recipient PC must have whatever face is used. So Arial it is.   \n   \nThere's no solution. We can educate users in how to embed, but we can't make them save two versions of every document (ie. one with fonts editable, one with them embedded for sending via email).   \n   \nI suppose we could implement a script on the email server, which would convert to PDF any Word document it saw leaving the building. However, this would also intercept documents which are deliberately sent in an editable form, so it's no good.   \n   \nThe only other thing I can think of: a future version of MS Office could let you save/transmit fonts used in a document, and keep them editable on recipient machines, \\*but only for that document\\*. If you cut and pasted to a new document, you'd paste in Times New Roman (or whatever default).   \n   \nFor this to happen, though, would require (a) Microsoft to write a better version of Acrobat than Adobe, and (b) Foundries to allow editable versions of their faces to ship (albeit in limited form) without royalties.   \n   \nIn other words, it's never gonna happen.   \n   \nHere's hoping MS expand their type library sometime soon. In another 15 years, the ubiquity of Arial may pervade my very soul.\n\n"
