Images attached.\n\n(This post is a bit duplicative, but the Typophile comment system gave me an error message every time I tried to include new images in a comment.)\n\n(In case anyone is curious, “Mendl’s” on the Mendl’s box is almost certainly hand lettered, and “Brucknerplatz No. 12” is either Modern 735 or Bodoni Campanile, which appear to be identical.)\n\nMany thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-08-25 at 11.12.30 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150110232746/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-25%20at%2011.12.30%20PM.png) | 197.34 KB |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-08-25 at 11.12.48 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150110232746/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-25%20at%2011.12.48%20PM.png) | 405.02 KB |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-08-25 at 11.10.01 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150110232746/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-25%20at%2011.10.01%20PM.png) | 1.09 MB |\n\n",
