Depending on how fast you need it and what the budget is, I would consult Linotype for license part, and then get help from for example Filip Blazék to make the actual signs needed for Polish and Czech.\n\n"

If you purchased these fonts from Linotype, please contact our sales department at [info@linotype.com](mailto:info@linotype.com). They can give you definitive answers. Also, they could discuss with you more possibilities about commissioning a custom version with the glyphs you need.\n\nThanks,  \nDan Reynolds  \nLinotype GmbH  \nProduct Marketing Department\n\n"
