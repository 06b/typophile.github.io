I'd be interested to see what the form would look like if the \"g\" continued a bit further up the left side (curling around a little before it was cut off) and then adding a tail to the bottom right of the \"u\". Adding a tail would require pulling the right side of the \"u\" in a little. Doing something like that might create more of an organic transition, rather than a bold \"u\" attached to bottom half of a \"g\".   \n   \nBy using the green color, I don't think there is any need for a sun representation. For several years now green has been a strong indicator for earth sensitivity. My guess is that politicians rarely look forward to correspondence/communication with green peace activists, so I think a more subtle approach might help their acceptability.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

But you're right that the \"u\" is too dark - or actually maybe the \"g\" is too light. Plus the \"g\" is cramped (which is natural in a [texty] font, but not a logo).   \n   \nI was trying to think how best to incorporate a sun/rays into it, and I was thinking you could make the left stem of the \"u\" curl around in a circle, and put the rays on the top-left of it (and maybe give the \"u\" a full stem on the right to reinforce its identity\\*). But then I thought maybe you should incorporate a leaf instead?   \n   \n\\* Which you might do even if you leave the \"u+g\" structure as-is.   \n   \n\\> .... a more subtle approach might help their acceptability.   \n   \nGood point.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

In my personal opinion the 4 leafs should be 5, for the simple reason that an odd number is more appealing than an even one. It might look funny, but give it a shot. Think of the leaf arrangement in terms of a half circle tilted at a 45 degree angle. Right now my eye sees the leaves arranged in an un-even fashion, but that's just an opinion.   \nIt is important to have the invisible diagonals going through the mark at key places(sorry if that, makes no since).   \n   \nDue to the asymetrical logo form you have created you might find it necessary to try some asymetrical lockups with the tagline, which Might work might not. Right now my eye reads the logo and then reads GRUN, and then reads UnternehmensGrun. It feels like the balace of information is a little skewed.   \n   \nFinally What does the variations of tones in the leaves symbolize. For me it feels a little to decorative and less direct. I would stick with one solid green, it seems more powerful that way, Unless there are conceptual reasons for tonality changes.   \n   \nHowever, with that said.
