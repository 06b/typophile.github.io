      "content": "Note: 'pause between parts of a sentence'. It isn't a very good definition, but it at least gets the notion that what a comma indicates is the structure of the sentence not a pause per se. When we talk, we punctuate structure with pauses, so commas in writing and pauses in speaking serve parallel purposes. The sequence of words 'yes we can' may be uttered as either a single clause or as two clauses: 'yes we can' or 'yes, we can'. How we read those two versions differs, as does how we would say them, both in terms of pause and emphasis. I watched again Obama's election night speech on YouTube, and it seemed clear to me that he was saying 'Yes we can', not 'Yes, we can'.\n\n"

We thought about giving the proceeds to a charity, to promote design, or to share it with the winner.\n\nWe just did not come to a conclusion. And we don't have any money. So if you have suggestions of what to do, if the shirt actually sells, we would love to hear from you. Leave your comment here or on the Plural site. And we will make an update with where the money from the sales will go.\n\nWe can also leave that up to the winner to decide.  \nIf the shirt sells: money goes to  \na) his pocket  \nb) someone else's pocket\n\nWe don't want to rip any one off, we just don't have any thing else to give. Other than bragging rights, and a cool shirt.\n\nHope to see some of these tees in the contest, they are awesome.\n\nNow, according to Bergie, I am a bastard that rips off designers.
