  "content": "While doing other legal research, I came across the case \"Masson, Seeley & Co., Ltd. v. Embosotype Manufacturing Co.\", (1924) 41 R.P.C. 160 [1923-28] Macg.Cop.Cas. 99, mentioned in \"Copinger and Skone James on Copyright\". According to this case based on the 1911 Copyright Act and dealing with a catalog of type, it would be illegal to depict fonts as it is done in books on typography and at various typographic websites. In my opinion, this old decision was a misjudgement, inasmuch as the court held that an alphabet of type, though it has no meaning in language, is a \"literary work\". If this were so, then any font depicted at Typophile, e.g. as attachment to postings, would constitute a copyright infringement of a \"literary work\".\n\n",
