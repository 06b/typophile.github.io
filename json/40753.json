  "content": "I'm looking for a new slab serif that has some extremely thin weights and some heavier weights for a headline font. Are there any good new ones floating around now that have not been used to bits?\n\nIts for a mens magazine, so I am looking for something that doesn't feel dainty. Ideally I'm looking for something geometric. I've included two samples of one treatment I'd use with the font, making a stencil out of it. Would greatly appreciate any suggestions.\n\nThanks\n\nnick\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [NYCLogo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131119122704/http:/typophile.com/files/NYCLogo.jpg) | 62.17 KB |\n| [!!! font.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131119122704/http:/typophile.com/files/!!!%20font.png) | 20.17 KB |\n\n",
