Perhaps a new method for auto trapping?   \n   \nThat's not the prettiest alphabet ever drawn, is it? Kinda has a Danielle Steele quality to it :-) Jill great catch.\n\n"

I appreciate!!   \n   \nHrant and Randy, original picture I got was this... to solve the mistery..   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000443im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16470.jpg)   \nSorry I did not post this one, becase I wanted to get rid of unnecesary areas.   \n   \nbj, thank you for your extra info. My Illustrator got a little confused with a PC font, but I made it work.   \n   \nThank you all!!\n\n"
