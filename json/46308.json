  "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI found a few threads on this, but they seemed to be several years old and I’d guess that options have changed at least a bit since then; I’m looking to buy a printer with postscript, at least A3+ (or borderless A3 if that exists in lasers) and colour. It would also be a bonus if it could take heavier papers too.\n\nOn a budget :)\n\nAny suggestions? Tips on what to look out for?\n\nThanks heaps!\n\n-Rafe\n\n [‹ Better than @font-face: an open internet font service](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201172622/http:/typophile.com/node/46264 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Hilarious font satire from SomthingAwful.com ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201172622/http:/typophile.com/node/46305 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
