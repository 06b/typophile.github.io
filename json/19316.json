I didn't see the birds untill I read the discription. maybe if the birds are reversed in black within the letters. they would still look like they are sitting, just on the baseline.\n\nanyways, i wish I could see the site.\n\n"

The logo is, unfortunately, in its finished state, but before that it was viewed by various people from this \"comix-community\". I didn't consider that they wouldn't have a problem recognising the pigeons, but for \"first-see-ers\" it might be puzzling...  \nThank you for bringing that up, I will be interested to hear if someone else also had a problem with this? :/\n\nI also thought someone might find the \"dot\" of the \"i\" a bit strange :/ When I look at it now, I think it could have been.. more consistent with the rest of the type. It seems a bit \"slim\" compared to the rest, doesn't it? :/\n\nps: The site is far from fantastic right now, you are not missing much ;)\n\n"

      "content": "I recognised the shapes as birds, and eventually as pigeons, however pigeons aren't a symbol of freedom (in the UK at least), doves are used as symbols of peace.  \nThe logotype looks strong, though I would look at the counters of the B and the bottom right of the G, as well as the dot on the i (I wonder if you need that at all). As for the text to the right try using the logotype (possibly without the pigeons) instead of the approximation of it. The actual text has a problem with the narrow measure, especially the second paragraph which is very ragged, making it broader should help, if you can bring incorporated up to the line above. The third paragraph seems to have a fourth paragraph (I chose this…) without a line break.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you so much for your time!  \nYou've been of great help.\n\ntimd, I agree with you completely...  \nThe treatment of the G though, was the hardest thing of all.  \nBecause if I made the radius of its inner circle smaller, then it's different from the C. However, right now, as you can see, the right bottom of the G is a bit heavy...  \nThat's just as good as I could get it :(\n\n"
