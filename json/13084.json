I don't have source to show you.\n\nAlso, just found Arena New by Gunter Gerhard Lange on Berthold site. It's got a larger x-height and more condensed than Mrs. Eaves.  \n [http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq\\_library/90098.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221133553/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90098.html \"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq\\_library/90098.html\")  \nThe sample is hard to review so I suggest downloading the PDF of Transitional type sample from their home page.\n\n---------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I'm back in style!\n\n"
