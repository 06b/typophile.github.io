  "content": "so i have a problem. fontlab 5.0.2 will no longer startup on my mac intel system. just started today. first time. it gets to the loading point where it says caching ATSUI fonts and then crashes out asking me to reopen or try again. something to that effect. i saw a previous thread about this but nothing ever seemed to be resolved. someone said uninstal problem fonts. well i deactivated all of them except the system fonts which i can’t change.\n\nplease help? i just bought this program two weeks ago...\n\n [‹ Oblique is slanted too much in ID PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314123407/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32485 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Photoshop CSx not recognizing calt feature ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314123407/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32458 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I think “FontLab won’t start on Mac” would have been a better choice. Glad you got it worked out on your own.\n\n"
