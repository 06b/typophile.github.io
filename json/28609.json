The area formerly known as Wachovia now makes up most of Forsyth County and the largest city is now Winston-Salem.\"\n\nSeems like the logo is pretty literal. Wavy lines = water. Type = old 18 or 19 century engravers roman. Makes a plain old thud on the page or screen. Easily recognized & processed, then just as easily forgotten, I think.\n\n"
