Create the letter, rasterize (layer \\> rasterize \\> type), then apply the mosaic filter (filter \\> pixelate \\> mosaic). Don't know how to in Illustrator.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202014747im_/http:/typophile.com/files/h4_5405.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Sure no probs, basically this is old school Ps stuff you know blur and then hit with the effect 'cept in Illy you have to go from vector to raster and then back to vector using Live Trace.\n\n1. Type your type.\n\n2. Blur the type ... Effect\\>Blur\\>Gaussian Blur ... I set the amount to 10 in both examples.\n\n3, Raterize the type ... Object\\>Rasterize, and in the Dialog box set the ppi on High. Using the Custom option and setting the value higher will result in a more detail rendering of the blur through the halftone filter resulting in more dots ...from 300ppi to 600ppi there is quite a difference. In the above T example I used a setting of 600ppi and in the below H example I used a 300 (default High) ppi setting.\n\n4, Apply the Color Halftone Effect ... Effect\\>Pixelate\\>Color Halftone, and in the Dialog box you can play around with the settings. But in both my examples I used a Max Radius of 40, and in the above Arial T I set all the Channels to 20 ...in the below Gotham H I set all the Channels to 90. Try messing around with the Channel settings to see how the Effect is rendered.\n\n5. Vector the Color Halftone ... Object\\>Live Trace\\>Make and Expand.\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202014747im_/http:/www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/TYPOPHILE_halftoneHvector.jpg)\n\nAfter the Effect is applied you can trim or crop as desired by using the Pathfinder options...\n\n"
