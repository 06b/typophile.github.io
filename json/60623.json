  "content": "Hi\n\nYears ago I had a document where Freehand replaced a font with Adobe Sans, and that looked pretty cool. I'd like to re-create that effect now, but I don't know if that would still work – instead of ATM I use FontExplorer X, it also has Adobe Sans installed. Does anyone know how I can get InDesign or Illustrator to replace a certain typeface with Adobe Sans now?\n\nThanks!\n\nI.\n\n",

This works with other MM fonts and everything I have tried to get multi masters installed in current versions of Adobe apps have not worked - such as putting font in app specific font folder, or into app package font folder etc.\n\n"
