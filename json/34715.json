  "content": "I was checking out some lead type at an antique store over the weekend, when another customer struck up a conversation with me about type. Turns out he used to be a linotype operator, and among other things, stressed the importance of washing your hands after handling lead type.\n\nKnowing nothing about lead (or whatever else is in metal type) poisoning, I was wondering how assiduous I should be about this. I know I shouldn't be putting it in my mouth or anything, but should I be wearing gloves, or would that even mitigate the potentially harmful effects? Thanks.\n\n",

Of course it could be a fire hazard too as it is in a wooden building. But of course I think the person you met offered a good tip which most would follow.  \nJordan\n\n"

Lead is only a health hazard if inhaled or ingested—which is why wallpapers with lead pigments killed so many people, and why children who grow up around peeling lead paint suffer problems with brain development.\n\n"

      "content": "I worked as a hand compositor for twenty years, day in, day out. At 61 I've been away from daily exposure to lead for nearly twenty years. I'm pretty healthy, and no doc has suggested any ailments I ever had may have come from lead. Back in those days I admit to holding a lot of Monotype sorts between my teeth. I also had pretty bad habits as far as hand-washing at lunch time. The first ten years or so that I worked in the trade it was also common for comps and pressmen to wash their hands with gasoline and other harsh solvents pretty regularly.\n\nI know one man in well into his 70s who's been dealing with lead type (and inhaling its fumes) for probably 50 years. He's the picture of health. Another man I know collapsed after only a few years working as a comp. His doc told him it was lead. The doc said my pal's bouts of impotence were also related to lead poisoning.\n\nAmong many variables we have to consider innate factors in any individual's makeup and health. I may develop something nasty in years to come that can be traced to lead. Or I may get carpal tunnel syndrome from 18 years at a computer. Or I could fall off my bike on the way home tonight.\n\nAt the SHARP conference in 05 a scholar presented a paper about the health of Baltimore printers in the late 19th century; he was specifically interested in lead. I'll see if I can find a www ref and post it.\n\nTonight I will drink several toasts in prayer for the continued good health of all of you.\n\npowers\n\n"
