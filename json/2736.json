That is because it used to have a cross bar and the thin got thinned even more to compensate. Now that it's gone, the thin needs some weight back. Make it look the same as the thin on the N. Also check the thick stroke. They may have been shaved too (hard to tell at this resolution). BTW since the M = A+A that will need fixing too.   \n   \nThe O might want more space in the middle (too dark). Instead of straight sides, try an oval made of 4 points.   \n   \nScript: This will need fixing in three places. 1. The Cr connection isn't smooth and could maybe use a bit more weight, 2. se spacing combination is too tight. You may want to draw a custom connection between them wrapping the s a little tighter and connecting it to the e. 3 er connection changes weight too quickly.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

Also, I think it has too many tiers (the mountain, the \"maui\", the \"mountain\", and \"cruisers\"). If you are going to do something decorative like the volcano-mountain then don't add another element with \"cruisers\".   \n   \nGoing back to Scott's idea: I think he has a good idea with the \"maui\" and \"mountain\" part, but I don't like the cruisers placement. I would mess with that. Here is my idea.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221744im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25319.gif)\n\n"

The upcurl or course is way too similar to the C but I had suggested way back that things could be center justified with that triangular base. something needs to 'end' it so to speak. perhaps just thinner and not so long. I donno.   \n   \nthe roughness thing was only because I exported paths of of Tim's .gif image and didn't bother simplifying them. I thought after that it might have been apropos for style...because honestly I don't see the relation of a danty, girly, script face with these freakish people who fall 38miles peddle-free. I'm sure the \"cruisers\" aren't that elegant. hehe   \n   \nbut anyway if this visual sparks an idea then great. Its sometimes hard to explain things in words.\n\n"

      "content": " **MAUI MOUNTAIN CRUISERS Redux**   \n   \nFirstly, my apologies for falling off there -- but I was past deadlines and had to move on to other aspects of what was a larger project.   \n   \nI wanted to be sure and post the final logo and thank everyone involved for their excellent eyes, critiques, guidance, feedback, ideas and mock-ups.   \n   \nUnfortunately, some feedback came just a little too late for me to respond to, as I had committed to one direction that I was (by that point) fine tuning. Thanks nonetheless, to Tanya, BJ, Tom C. and Andrew for their concepts.   \n   \n**SPECIAL Thanks** to Scott K., Tiffany, and Hrant for their professorial like tutelage -- never giving away too much, but just enough to inspire one to think about the design challenge in new ways.   \n   \n**SUPERCALAFRAGILISTICEXPEALIDOCIOUS T h a n k s** to Randy Jones for his mentoring and hands on help perfecting those pesky script face beziers, not to mention other subtleties which really brought the final design to life. Thanks Aquatoad!   \n   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221744im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/29180.gif)   \n   \n   \n**Notes About The Final Design**   \nMuch happened as compared to iteration \"10.74\" from my post #104, including weight and letterform changes to the \"M,\" a sizing up of \"Maui,\" and the obvious enhancements to \"Cruisers\" which include smoothing of the curves and connectors, adding weight to the face, a bit of vertical squashing, and a fine finishing flourish. Color directions have yet to be decided, but are likely to resemble the lavaesque orange currently displayed at the new website where you can see the logo basking:   \n [http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221744/http:/www.mauimountaincruisers.com/)   \n   \n   \n**What I Learned**   \nSKETCH, SKETCH, SKETCH! Whether by pencil, paper and erasure (my preference) or tablet -- there is simply no better way to work out solutions to logotype and letterform challenges than mad scientist like sketching. Have fun with it. Brainstorm, scribble any concept that comes to mind.   \n   \nThere are many possible ways to solve a problem, but there's usually one or two that are \"best.\" Still, it's subjective, and what you consider best might be someone else's \"worst.\"   \n   \nUse your eyes. Always consider legibility. How do the letterforms \"sound\" to your eyes? Balance positive as well as negative space. White space is your friend -- don't ignore it.   \n   \nKnow when to say when. There comes a point where you have to commit, fine tune and finish -- even with personal projects.   \n   \nContrast is key, especially when it comes to logos with many words and letters such as this one.   \n   \n   \n**Typophile Props**   \nTypophile, in my opinion, is the web's richest resource and community. The sheer abundance and quality of information available to type designers, typographers, and graphic designers is astonishing.   \n   \nI only hope that I can give back some iota of what I've received in my little time here. In fact, it's my prediction that I'll reach 6,000 post long before Hrant. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221744im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \n   \nThanks again to everyone who participated. I hope I can offer valuable input to your thread as well.   \n   \nAloha,   \n   \n -tim\n\n"

It messes with the eyes in a negative way.   \n   \nThe connection of the letters s\\>e is too tight and seems like there could be a smoother transition from letter to letter. The s seems a little tall (in the altogether and in the loop), which could explain why the transition from s to e seems forced. And the r seems a little short. The connection from C to r seems to have a bump in it too.   \n   \nI really like the direction you have taken this, however I wonder if the word \"Cruisers\" could be a little more extended? Looser. Same style, but more of a scrawl or rather stretched across the bottom of the word \"Mountain\"?\n\n"
