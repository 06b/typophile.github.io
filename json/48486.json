  "content": "Hello. This summer I've been introduced to Wordpress and I liked it. So I decided to use it for my sites. I've begun with the site about the [Fell Types](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015184032/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fell%20Types). Essentially I've added a page about their history. It's far to be exhaustive but it's better than nothing. I think I will use the Wordpress' \"post mechanism\" to add other infos easily (doing something I haven't done for years!).\n\nI hope you like it.\n\nIgino Marini\n\n",
