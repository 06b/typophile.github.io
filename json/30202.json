I'm trying to do a find/change on the section numbers of a document, and so far, I've only been able to get it to change  \none number.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414214700im_/http:/typophile.com/files/31_6638.png)\n\nI'm using ^9.(space) to find all instances of numbers, but it seems to only change one of the numbers to the new style I want to apply.\n\nAny secrets? Thanks in advance…\n\n",
