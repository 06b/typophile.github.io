I've been told that it's more about choosing two very different fonts. If I'm using something like Futura for my title font, should I really stick to a serifed typeface? Would something like Helvetica Neue Light look sloppy? Thanks for the help.\n\n",

You can also throw in Trade Gothic for text.\n\nI have had success mixing 19th-century grotesques, though the appearance is more specialized. Grotesque MT, Gothic 13, Alternate Gothic #2 all mix nicely and create a living texture on the page. Additionally Champion can be thrown in with discretion, but it looks more 'designed' so it tends to leech away some of the quaintness.\n\n"

Maybe choose a stronger humanist-sans like frutiger or gill sans for whismsical and warm text without the serifs. Basically pick a sans with a large family AND the personality you want. I love franklin but it's heavy, cold and dark compared to the humanist-sans... might be what you want. Have fun with this challenge!\n\nGo trendy–consider pairing a very bold or book for small body text with a very light/ thin font in the family for large titling/headers. Everyone's doing it for a reason :)\n\n"

If you feel that weight emphasis isn't enough, go width-wise. I find that pairing a light extended grotesk (say, Univers 43) with a body copy of its regular variant (Univers 55) works very well. Or pair a regular with a condensed (Univers condensed is surprisingly readable!) Or a thin ultra condensed with a regular. From here on, the possibilities are endless, as long as you make the two face widths and/or weights _different enough._\n\n"

The very idea of pairing two gothic faces together shudders me.\n\nNews and Franklin Gothic were designed by Morris Fuller Benton to go together, as [this explains](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227175943/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans/more). Were it today, News Gothic, Franklin Gothic and Alternative Gothic would be regarded as part of the same family. Tobias Frere-Jones and Cyrus Highsmith actually did work them all into a more consistent single family, called [Benton Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227175943/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans).\n\n"

You just swipe left or right to change the headline or body. You can create a couple thousand variations.\n\nFor instance, you can set News Gothic Bold as headline and Franklin Gothic as the body and see how it looks. Then you can flip it around and set Franklin Gothic Demi as the header and News Gothic as the body. They both work nice, though I didn't know the history about those two typefaces until I read this article!\n\nThere are quite a few classic serifs in the app to play with (Avenir, Centurty, Helvetica, Din, Eurostyle, etc.).\n\nTake a look. There is a resource book coming out too that showcases a lot more variety per example.\n\n"
