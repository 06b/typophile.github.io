I tried markers and now playing with paint buckets.  \nAny of you know how to do some neat but dirty stuff to make a design look either washed out/streets hip and 'hand made'? Please share. Thank you!\n\n",

Maybe some of the attendees can share their experience\"\n\n**_Glyph Kitchen - Alphabet Sauce and other Typographic Condiments_**\n\n_The glyph kitchen is a place for exploring type in a variety of media. Forget the technological side of type design and return to the physical element of making letters, ornaments, words, and sentences - anything typographic._\n\n"

You'll get fun stretchy copies that way\n\nYou might even manage to get that stretchy effect on modern desktop scanners (though you'd have to supply motion in the original yourself), but you won't get the grittyness of a copier that way.\n\n"

I have the original 1st set and have used it a few times to customise t-shirts. The new pimped version of the software is even more slick. Seriously customizable and you really can tweak the living daylights out of it. Yes, I do think photocopies and steel wool are totally valid, but I also think these filters are just as valid.\n\n"

Is that crazy? ;) Everything suggested so far is a mechanical technique to artificially \"antique\" some type.\n\nWe're giving the hand-lettering workshop again this year at TypeCon and it looks to be very fun. Cut paper, ink, drawn, pen-written, calligraphic, brush-lettered and any other kind of handmade lettering. Experimental and low-tech. If you're coming to TypeCon, join us. Useful skills if the power goes out. ;)\n\n"

The key to using a tool is to know how and why to use them. It is all about subtleties.\n\n"
