  "content": "I’m designing a logo for a stationary line, and after much research I’m still clueless about what font to use. The stationary can be described as modern, bold, elegant and feminine (not overly feminine, though) and the company has a strong “earth friendly” profile. I have been thinking of Coquette, but I’m not sure... I also need a compainion font that can be used for product info placed directly under the logo.\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated!\n\n [‹ mixed-type logotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121184446/http:/typophile.com/node/40985 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fonts with old style tabular figures ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121184446/http:/typophile.com/node/39900 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’s hugely versatile.\n\n"
