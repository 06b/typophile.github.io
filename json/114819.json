The [digital](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822180849/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/life/%20?refby=bowfin) version does not show the slightly angled eye of the 'e', but the distinctive slanted upper bowl of the 'g' is there. It seems as if your scan lost some details, like the ear of the 'g' and the arm (?) of the 'r', but if I had to guess right now, that would be my choice.\n\nAnyone else have some printed metal samples of Life to compare?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The \"Life\" italic J should not have a serif on the tail of the J, just as it does not in the Roman J (see John Rimmer in bottom sample). The type is surely not Times because the J is below the baseline and the wrong shape.\n\nI'm sticking with my answer.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
