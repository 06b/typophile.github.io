My plan to offer single-server embedding licenses at a low price ran into a wall: MyFonts system just isn’t designed for those licensing options. I was going to set up my own web store to handle the sales, but than I ran into a wall of incorporation and sales tax laws. I’m not making enough money to justify hiring a lawyer and an accountant and setting up a new online store, so I decided to rewrite the workstation license to allow web embedding.\n\n"

Lots of whine, no cheese.\n\nStuff like @font-face won't work unless foundries let go of some fears.\n\nPermit me to give you guys a gentle ribbing. Right now font licensing so complex that licensors can't just focus on the right typographic solution, they have to navigate cumbersome EULAs and nuanced embedding permissions. (Foundry A has these flavors, Foundry B has these other flavors.)\n\nConsider how the iTunes music store made it easier to buy license music than to download it illicitly. Seriously. Win, win. Yes, music is still downloaded and shared illicitly, but the default is that it's just easier to buy it. This is an analogy, and not a perfect one, but I think it has merit. Companies that make it easy (and have quality type) will win -- that's why I was motivated to start the list.\n\nThe complexity is the foundries' problem to solve, not your customers'.\n\n"
