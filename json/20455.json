There are tweaks to be made after applying it, depending on the situation but it seems like a much better starting point than Metrics for large type. Has the technology improved since the above posts in the new versions of InD? Is this bad practice? How do others use this feature? or do you use it at all? I feel like this optical spacing would be inappropriate for body copy? Are some typefaces setup with ’optical’ AND ’metrics’ or is this purely an InD technology? Discuss!\n\n [‹ Interesting Type treatments](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203183359/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20540 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [changing courier to set text ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203183359/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20014 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Try out some text and see which setting you like better. For that matter try both Optical and Metrics kerning on several different typefaces.... You will find that ID loosens text at small sizes compared to the built-in kerning (Metrics), and tightens at large sizes.\n\n"

If I have a small amount of type for a heading at a large size (and if the standard metrics don’t quite work) I track and kern it myself. Sometimes I try the Adobe Optical and tweak it afterward. Mr. Cosgrove is right, just putz with it and see what works best.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

The same text is sampled in the book’s Figure 11 with metrics kerning applied:**\n\n<cite>The optical kerning option tends to increase the spacing of characters as it moves from rightways or leftways and so the user’s guide recommends that after the ’kerning’ is applied some negative tracking should be applied generally to compensate for this. The literature does not say how much tracking might be needed but -7 seems sufficient for this example. Note that the r and the comma in ’matter,’ (in the tenth line) are now agreeably spaced.</cite>\n\n"
