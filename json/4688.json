      "content": "illustration is excellent, although I am not sure right side saucer reflection/edge is necessary. I think without right side saucer edge/reflection it may be more usable in various applications.   \n   \nIf this retailer ever decided to haveor sponsor movie nights a variation on this logo could be really nice as it already has a bit of a camera shutter efffect going.   \n   \nType is nice but not as special as illustration. What typeface-it looks familiar but I am not sure?   \n   \nSince name has \"centre\" in it, have you tried placing logo between the words \"espresso\" and \"centre\"\n\n"

If I place a cup between words I will looks good But I am affraid a cup will get lost a little bit in this case...   \n   \nAnd at the end, could you to critic please my logo for company, which interests are in education and real estate fields.   \n   \n   \n  ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221441im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/35539.jpg)\n\n"
