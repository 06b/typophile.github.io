  "content": "ok i give up...I've tried multiple times to put pictures up and they're too big to even attach as a file and even saving the pictures i was going to use onto one page using Adobe wont work for me. i give up!!! I'll come back and post the pictures once I find someone smarter than me to help...until then, heres what I have to say about signs in New Orleans:\n\nThere were two things I really noticed about signs in New Orleans last weekend while walking down Magazine Street with Jessee...There are a lot of hand drawn and/or painted signs, and a lot of signs are in French or at least have some French feeling to them in some way. I really like that there are a lot of hand done signs. It makes places stand out more, and it makes them more memorable. It also gives more of an artistic feel to the city which is so well known for artsy things. When I go visit my family in Texas I don't see as many original, unique signs as I see in New Orleans. I think its nice to see so many artistic displays around town. It really makes things more interesting and beautiful, especially in an artist's view.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629063537im_/http:/typophile.com/files/100_0496%20copy_5405.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629063537im_/http:/typophile.com/files/100_0501%20%20copy_5731.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629063537im_/http:/typophile.com/files/100_0502%20copy_6258.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629063537im_/http:/typophile.com/files/100_0506%20edit_4380.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629063537im_/http:/typophile.com/files/100_0509%20copy_4484.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629063537im_/http:/typophile.com/files/100_0511%20copy_4042.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629063537im_/http:/typophile.com/files/100_0512%20copy_5569.jpg)\n\n",
