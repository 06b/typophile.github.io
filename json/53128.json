  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm in the beginning stages of this new type I'm working on called Lundan. I'm new to typography but I think I've got the basics down and I was wondering if anyone had any critique of my uppercase for me? I don't have a Z yet, obviously but it is a WIP. Any help is much appreciated. PLEASE BE HARSH.\n\nUpdated since comments below.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [lundanbeta.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725164341/http:/typophile.com/files/lundanbeta.png) | 20.3 KB |\n| [lundanwash.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725164341/http:/typophile.com/files/lundanwash.png) | 23.4 KB |\n\n",

I think what it is is that most of the letters have a slightly hand painted look which I like. They could have all been painted with single strokes of a wide brush. However the U and W look sharper with more geometric precision.\n\n"
