Over this weekend, I had a few sketches that stood out and I decided to run with them. The attached image is the lower-case result of those.\n\nI know I'm still a bit early in the process, but I really wanted to get feedback right off the bat. I'm still trying to grasp the technical details of font design and would appreciate input in that regard. I'm sure there's at least a few faux paus here.\n\nOverall, the style started its inspiration from the [Verb font family](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317173622/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/verb/). I liked the more angular feel it had to it, but wanted my own spin and something that leaned toward a serif rather than a sans.\n\nSo, with that, I'm excited to hear everyone's thoughts and input.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font-001.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317173622/http:/typophile.com/files/font-001.jpg) | 83.81 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Where the thins branch off the stems, they look too thick, as if they thicken as they go in. This may be an optical illusion, but to counter it you may want to make them taper thinner as they join.  \nThe horizontal terminal on /r/'s arm is awkward and doesn't really fit with the rest of the font (e.g. descender of /g/). Perhaps it should also be narrower.  \nThick/thin pattern of /v/w/y/ feels backwards.  \nCrossbar of /f/t/ might be too thick.  \n/e/ looks too wide.  \nAre the right stems of h/m/n/u/ the same width as the left?  \nLots of awkward curves but if you can work that stuff out there's promise in this.\n\n"
