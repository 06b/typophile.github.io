  "content": "Hello All,\n\nI was given [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20071227152744/http:/www.imageshack.us/) recently by a client who wants the same font on his project as Maxim uses in it’s “Circus Maximus” page. When I couldn’t find the exact same font I suggested very similar alternatives (CC Dave Gibbons, CC Wild Words, or Blambot’s Jack Armstrong came to mind). He insists, however, on trying to get the exact same font if possible.\n\nI’ve even tried contacting Maxim directly but alas did not have my calls returned.\n\nI was hoping some fresh eyes here could help out as maybe I missed the obvious. As always, any help is appreciated.\n\nHere again is the link to the image:  \n [Click here for Image](http://web.archive.org/web/20071227152744/http:/img158.echo.cx/img158/8245/cmc31ae.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Bronx Zoo headline face - Erbar Cond {Lex}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071227152744/http:/typophile.com/node/12826 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [techy digits in \"Sitellite 4.0\" logo - OCR-B, ??? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071227152744/http:/typophile.com/node/12679 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I was hoping I missed something either at Comicraft, Blambot or perhaps another font I hadn’t even thought of. Perhaps someone will still recognize this and point it out. Here’s to hoping ...\n\n"
