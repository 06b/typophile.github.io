In order to outline it with “one word” we came up with a finding to outline the strategy - SEAWISE.\n\nPlease note that this brand is not created to mark Saaremaa as a tourist destination only. It equally focuses onto the local habitants, investors, enterpreneurs.\n\n[http://www.kiirasoosaar.ee/SB\\_3m.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100212133108/http:/www.kiirasoosaar.ee/SB_3m.jpg \"http://www.kiirasoosaar.ee/SB\\_3m.jpg\")\n\nThank you very much.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nOtt\n\n",
