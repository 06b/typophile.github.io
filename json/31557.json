  "content": "Hi folks,  \nThis sample shows what at first seems to be a hand-printed ad, but closer inspection shows that it is a font with 2 or 3 variations of most letters (some might be part of ligatures). This screams OpenType, but so far the only hand-printing font I know like this is [Casino Hand](http://web.archive.org/web/20100725040753/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/casino-hand/) by Matt Desmond. The thing that makes this work so well is that the lettering looks so natural.\n\nDoes anyone recognize it? I wonder if the 'cheap, easy-to-make hand-printed fonts' have just moved into the world of OpenType.\n\nThanks,  \n- Mike\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [CaptainElecticScript.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20100725040753/http:/typophile.com/files/CaptainElecticScript.gif) | 112.58 KB |\n\n",

There are an increasing number of OpenType fonts coming on the market, but I'm looking for something besides Casino Hand that looks hand-made, and contemporary, like the sample.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I found a similar-looking font in Chank's GFY Handwriting Fontpak, called [GFYJeanna](http://web.archive.org/web/20100725040753/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/gfy-handwriting-fontpak/gfyjeanna-regular/), which comes in an OpenType version, but the character maps give little idea of more than a few optional characters. It's only similar stylistically -- no letters are identical to my sample. I'm hoping someone knows of another casual OpenType hand-printed font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
