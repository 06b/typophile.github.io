Do I, as the designer, purchase the font and license for my cpu and then simply deliver the finished product to he client charging for only for the work?   \n   \nAre client's expected to pay for fonts if they are not to actually be installed on their cpu?   \n   \nWhat if I buy two typefaces and ultimately decide that only on is appropriate for the job?\n\n",

      "content": "Tim, not a dumb question at all.   \n   \nI don't know what \"standard practice\" (if such a thing exists) is, but I usually purchase and license the fonts myself, and either wrap it into the project charge or line-item it as \"materials\" on the invoice. If it's something like a major campaign or identity project -- a project with a long life and/or broad application -- then I'll help the client license it directly for their own use.   \n   \nSometimes it doesn't seem appropriate to pass the charge on to the client (like in your example, if I buy fonts that don't get used in the project). In those cases I just absorb the expense as part of the cost of doing business. It's never a bad thing to have more typefaces in my toolbox.\n\n"
