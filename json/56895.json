  "content": "Hello  \nA few years ago I remember reading about (and possibly even purchasing) a font that mimics lettering in 18th-19th Century ironwork fencing/gates, like you would see on the gates to a public park, a large estate, castle, etc. (The images I'm uploading are the general idea)  \nThe font included not just the letterforms, but a way to create the horizontal/vertical iron bands and scrollwork that \"held\" the letters, also.  \nI think it was called something like Covent Garden or Chelsea Garden, but I've done a search and can't find anything like that. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804054506im_/http:/typophile.com/files/royal3bg_3878.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804054506im_/http:/typophile.com/files/w-ironwork_5211.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804054506im_/http:/typophile.com/files/nameplate_4551.jpg)\n\n",
