  "content": "Hi,\n\nIt seems like a lot of designers are now using sans that aren't exactly 'geometrical' like Gotham, Helvetica etc. I recently purchased [Freight Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php), but are curious to what else it out there. [Whitney](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026) is in the same style I guess and Stag Sans is great too. What is the official name of this style of sans font?\n\nThe font I'm looking for would be similar to Freight sans (with or without two story g), but I would like something a bit cleaner if you know what I mean.\n\nI've included some images of various fonts. The new sans font from Wired magazine has already been discussed in here somewhere, but I'd still like to know more about it.\n\nFont from Wired Magazine\n\nFont from The Independent Magazine\n\nFont from Outside Magazine\n\nI know that the fonts in Wired and Outside are most likely custom fonts, so suggestions for similar fonts are very welcome.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wired_4130.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220im_/http:/typophile.com/files/independent_4889.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220im_/http:/typophile.com/files/outside_3573.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I would describe Freight, Stag, and Whitney as somewhere between [humanist](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/typophile.com/wiki/humanist) and [gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/typophile.com/wiki/gothic) or [grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/typophile.com/wiki/grotesque). Whitney, for example, is based on the structure of a gothic (Trade Gothic) but its finish gives it a more humanist air.\n\nHelvetica is commonly categorized as a \"neo-grotesque\".\n\nThe \"Outside\" font is not Gotham, though the caps are very similar. It's most likely something custom from [Font Bureau](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Bureau), who often works with publishers like these. As for their retail fonts, you might dig their Antenna or Amplitude.\n\nIn the vein of Whitney are [Lucas de Groot](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lucas%20de%20Groot)'s [Taz](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/taz_iii/), [Spiegel](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/spiegel/) and [Corpid](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Corpid).\n\nNew faces in the neo-grotesque realm include [Maquette](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/maquette/), [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_complete_ot/), [Akkurat](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/), and [Paralucent](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Paralucent) (though this last one could be called a \"neo-neo-grotesque\" or \"pseudo-neo-grot\".\n\nIf you're interested in typeface classifications I highly recommend getting a copy of [Bringhurst](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210220/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Robert%20Bringhurst)'s \"Elements of Typographic Style\".\n\n"
