SEPTEMBER 09.  \n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n**Sudtipos** is proud to announce the release of **[Semilla](http://web.archive.org/web/20140522151147/http:/sudtipos.com/fonts/116)**\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140522151147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophilesemilla_5625.jpg)\n\n**[Download the PDF Specimen \"The top ten albums by Semilla Records\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20140522151147/http:/www.veer.com/download/pdf/semilla_specimen.pdf)**\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140522151147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophilesemilla2_5714.jpg)\n\n**About Semilla**\n\nInspired by the work of mid-century German lettering artist Bentele. Semilla means seed in Spanish. And the work of Bentele served as the germ from whence this new font has emerged.\n\nWith an upbeat and casual flavor, Semilla springs forth with a feel of youthful experimentation. Swashes swoop upward, ending in ball terminals that evoke the feeling of sprouts bursting forth in spring.\n\nAs always, Sñr. Paul provides a vast palette of glyphs with plenty of OpenType features and beautiful ligatures for your enjoyment.\n\nRead the history about the design of Semilla at the **[Semilla PDF Specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20140522151147/http:/www.veer.com/download/pdf/semilla_specimen.pdf)**\n\n**About Semilla PDF Specimen**\n\nThe artful photos used in this booklet are by French photographer and designer **[Stéphane Giner](http://web.archive.org/web/20140522151147/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/stephaneginer/)**. He is very deserving of your patronage, so please keep an eye out for his marvelous work.\n\nLicense Semilla [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140522151147/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000472#specimen)\n\n",
