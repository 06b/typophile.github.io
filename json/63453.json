Interesting that 'Cabernet Swash' from Jukebox has nearly an identical ampersand.\n\nIt's really annoying that Veer doesn't let you Flont the \"&\" symbol. :\\\n\n"

      "content": "What it matches exactly is the alternate ampersand of Pistilli Roman (a film type shown in the 1985 Phil's Photo book called \"Homage to the Alphabet\"). The closest digital font I know to Pistilli Roman is [Carousel](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018094951/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/carousel-lt/regular/characters.html), however Carousel does not have this alternate ampersand. It also has differences mainly in the lower case (e, g, k, v, w, x, y, z). Uppercase K and Q are different.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
