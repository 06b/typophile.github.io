  "content": "I would love any suggestions on a font / fonts to use for this website. I am not a design professional, and I'm struggling with trying to create a design in Squarespace. I've had a website for a couple of years on Wordpress, but never had any branding or consistency - my header was just the photo with the generic text. I'm not opposed to buying any fonts (I'm on a Mac), and I do have an older version of Photoshop (I think it's CS3), so if the font isn't supported by Squarespace, I could buy it and just incorporate it into the .psd image. I'm not even sure where to start looking for the type of font, but I know this is not the right one. By the way, I'm not married to anything I have here - I might even change the photo, but it would be something like this. I think it needs to be something more masculine / creative? Thank you for your suggestions.  \nSue\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417161207im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DoanWebiteFrontPageType_4235.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I would recommend an old style sans serif.  \nSans, because the consistency of line weight and lack of serifs connotes mechanical efﬁciency, and old-style (a.k.a. humanist) to connote custom attention to detail.\n\nMy effort in this genre is [Sensibility](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417161207/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sensibility/).  \nYou can use “old style”, “humanist” and “sans” as keyword searches at font sites to ﬁnd others.\n\n"
