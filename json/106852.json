      "content": "Nike is well-known for its bespoke typefaces and particularly the people at [Nike Bowery Stadium](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/typophile.com/node/103278) where this photo shoot comes from.  \nThis sample is very close to [Nomad](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/coniglio/nomad): straight oblique /S transition above median line, low /A crossbar, pointy /M centre vertex above baseline, 3 upper terminals /W, straight oblique /R leg. But Nomad is bolder and /R is rather off... Some more alternatives: [Strassenbahn](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.tendollarfonts.com/strassenbahn) (/M and /W off), [Nicotine](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine) (/W off), [Tempus Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/tempus-gothic) (/S, /M, /R off), [Bourgeois](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/virusfonts/bourgeois) Condensed (mixing Regular/Alternate, probably my candidate for customization as it offers a maximum of flexibility), [Primex](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/primex)/ [Big Noodle Titling](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/big-noodle-titling/), [Enamela](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/enamela), [Geheimagent](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/capearcona/ca-geheimagent)\n\nEDIT: after further inspection, [Refrigerator Deluxe](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116153155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/refrigerator-deluxe) Light might work pretty well...\n\n"
