It has three wieghts: Regular(9px), Bold(9pxBold) & Large(12px).   \ni stoped working on the font because it seemed very ugly and tastless all of a sudden. most of all, it looks very boring. looks like a font somebody has allready made.   \n  \nplease be frank with me and tell me what you really think.   \n   \n/image{camilla v1}\n\n",
