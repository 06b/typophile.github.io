  "content": "Hello,  \nI've searched and found a couple of posts of people asking for help on this topic, but nothing exactly related to decorative ends. I help people put decorative one-line phrases and quotes above their windows, doors, etc. Everyone asks me for help about the size the ornaments need to be in relation to the text. Does anyone have any general guidelines?\n\nI have a couple of examples that I would like to be critiqued below...how are the size and placement of the decorative ends in relation to the text?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825123942im_/http:/typophile.com/files/peace-to-this-house_foyer_5775.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825123942im_/http:/typophile.com/files/now-and-forever_window_6100.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825123942im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Laissez-les-bons-temps-roulez_Family-room_6337.jpg)\n\nthanks in advance,  \nylenyon\n\nP.S. I'm also looking for someone willing to consult with my company on this topic, so if you do such work, please let me know. thx\n\n",
