  "content": "Hey, I do a weekly comic published here in the foggy wonderland that is Halifax, Nova Scotia, and thought you guys might appreciate it. It's almost purely typographic, hand-drawn, and there are at least three people who like it alot. So let's make it upwards of five, and I'll have achieved everything I have eveer set out to do, and can go hibernate or something.\n\nIt's called the hall of best knowledge and you can see the first 25 or so here:\n\n[**http://www.flickr.com/photos/rayfenwick/sets/787564/**](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114053101/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/rayfenwick/sets/787564/)\n\nAnyways, I hope you like it. I've lurked here for a long time (love the forum widget) so it's nice to \\*participate\\*.\n\nRespectfully,  \nRay Fenwick\n\n",
