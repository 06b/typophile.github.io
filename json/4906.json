I hope FL will spend their time getting the Mac version   \n\\>out as soon as possible rather than working to make it OS 9 compatible.   \n   \nI hope so too. But as for my Mac being too old, OSX does not run satisfactorily. Therefore, If FL5 is not available in OS9 ,I would like to purchase FL4.6.   \nSome day,I bought new Mac, I will be going to upgrade FLStudio5 immediately.\n\n"

Also, some features like   \nAnchors will not work with the OS9 version.   \nThe metrics window seems to be smoother under X too.\n\n"
