There seems to be a legal hassle behind it, one they wouldn’t tell me about.\n\nIn the past both Image Club Graphics and Bitstream had digitized and sold it, but sorry, ICG is long gone and Bitstream no longer sells it.\n\nThere use to be a copy for the taking online - but even that has been removed.\n\nThis would be a wonderful time for a 1/1 since neither wdpartnerdesign nor gilles have email/website or send messages....\n\nIf you need something typeset - just ask.\n\n"
