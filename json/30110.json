  "content": "I’m curious to see what typefaces people are using in their daily startup sets. I know it’s more interesting to take the time and experiment with different fonts for each new design project, but for many reasons, (time, budget etc.) one must rely on the tried and true methods of efficiency. I know many of these daily sets are directly applicable to the industries and clients we serve, but I’d be very interested to see what others are doing. I’ll start. Here is a sampling of what my daily set includes:  \nAachen  \nAkzidenz Grotesk  \nAldus  \nBembo  \nFrutiger  \nGill Sans  \nMachine  \nMyriad  \nPerpetua  \nPopplLaudatio  \nUnivers\n\n",
