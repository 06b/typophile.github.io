  "content": "Hi,\n\nIs anyone here familiar with the book ABOUT FACE by David Jury? See below\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203183750im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/2880466776_4481.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg)\n\nI really wanted to find out exactly the main typefaces used throughout this book.  \nAnd also the vendor I could purchase these typefaces from.\n\nAlso I am after an entire family of Helvitica in its purist form, as in closest digital version  \nto the original and best family. I have “bit and pieces” of helvetica laying around but nothing  \nin its entirety (family etc).\n\nI hope I made sense here. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\n [‹ (x) Google \"Summer of Green\" type - Neutraface {Geoff}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203183750/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20990 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Chippewa Valley - The unexpected Wisconsin logo - Albertus, Trade Gothic {Patricia} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203183750/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20960 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
