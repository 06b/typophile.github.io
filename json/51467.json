There's some very popular fat sans-serifs right now (think Cooter), however they're not as easily recognizable as they should be.\n\nI want this to be instantly recognizable. All counters are square, or highly angular. Most counters are about about 75% of the size of hairlines, although I'm thinking about making the hairlines slightly thicker still.\n\nThe \"ú\" is replacing \"oo\" because I happen to think it looks cooler. The pronounciation should come out similarly, right? (not completely sure, somewhere I read that it makes a close sound... or maybe I assumed that from the spelling of Fútbol?)\n\n",

      "content": "I really like it overall. I think some of the letters are a bit conservative, and some have a bit too much personality. The \"T\", for example, seems a bit too plain, like the top should be heavier. The \"E\", \"F\", and \"O\" seem a bit extreme in comparison to the T. The humps of the M are fun, but not really echoed in any other shapes, so I might think about making these humps less pronounced. The \"R\" and \"G\" are the most interesting to me, because they look genuinely wonky, in a good way.\n\n"

There are also other issues which are obvious to my eyes now.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
