  "content": "A great post on the newest addition to my favorite design sites list (idsgn): [Designing type with cars](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023200017/http:/www.idsgn.org/posts/designing-type-with-cars/).\n\n_In a project sponsored by Toyota, Belgium-based design duo Pierre Smeets and Damien Aresta (of pleaseletmedesign) teamed up with race car driver Stefan van Campenhoudt to create a typeface using a car and some sophisticated software._\n\nThe project made use of a new Toyota iQ specially outfitted with 4 color markers, used for tracking its position. Interactive artist Zach Lieberman from openFrameworks (who creates a lot of cool stuff like this) was the brains behind the custom software which tracked the car in realtime as it was filmed from above. The software used the car’s motion paths to create the vector outlines which were then used by the type designers to create the free iQ Agility Font.\n\nThere's even a font to download.\n\n(Apologies if this has already been posted. I also wanted to get this up here because I was talking up idsgn to a bunch of people at TypeCon and this serves as a way to share the site.)\n\n",
