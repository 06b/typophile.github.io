  "content": "I would value your expert help in guiding me in my attempt to find resources connected to kerning a font in FontLab meant to be exported in OT format (but at least a basic set of instructions to work for T1 export would do just fine for now)\n\nthe typeface in question has only uppercases and is based on the basic shapes of Times New Roman, being intended as a modern refreshment and a replacement for the latter in an identity programme.\n\nI have heard discussions on a (not so liked by many of you out there) practice consisting of using font metrics data from a well kerned typeface.\n\nAny help is greatly apreciated.\n\n",
