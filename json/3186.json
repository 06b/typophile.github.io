  "content": "I've been using News Gothic in 0S 9 with ATM Deluxe 4.6.1 for a long time now without any problems. Upon upgrading to OS X and Suitcase, the font no longer works. I tried a friend of mines copy of News Gothic and get the same result. I tried it with the demo version of Font Reserve also with the same results. Font Doctor says the font isn't corupt. Same with Extensis tech support. Has anyone had this problem with News Gothic or any other face? Thanks.\n\n",

This is a real problem because this is our company typeface and I'm literally stuck in OS 9 just to use this font. It's ridiculous. Could it be something with the production of the font and OS X, so maybe it's Bitstream's problem? Maybe I'll try contacting them.   \n   \nAny ideas or advice would help, I need this resolved quickly.\n\n"

Apparently, it's managing   \nthousands of fonts that truly warrants a font   \nutility.   \n   \n(This last bit is basically hearsay from another   \nOS X forum.
