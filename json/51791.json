That's how I reconcile it or, more properly, explain it. He explored some hypotheses and found them incorrect.\n\nIn the case you cite, he wondered if Uncial forms would be more \"natural\" for the reading of English, thinking that the Latin forms would be better suited for, well, Latin presumably, and I guess the romance languages.. So he experimented to see if Winchester Uncial would yield revolutionary results in legibility in setting English. It didn't and he said so, but Winchester without the uncial forms is actually a really charming face and he did some great work in Hingham with it. I don't think the digital versions really do it justice.\n\nTruly, Hrant, WAD was a kindred soul to you. He worried about and was involved in every step of type production; he took careful consideration of legibility AND readability; he wasn't afraid to explore radical ideas (including the abandonment of many chirographic forms).\n\n[As an aside, weren't uncial forms originally Roman anyway and brought to the British Isles during the Roman occupation? They may have then hit an artistic peak as Insular majascule etc,... but it seems like WAD was really off base on that one.]\n\n"

I also thought maybe one of the heavier italics, which get funky and chunky (Cyrus called them \"tasty\"). But after that rich, chewy Beorcana, I thought in the end that something light and airy might be a nice change, and so I suggested the Light Italic.\n\nHrant -- I was being only half-serious (and taking you only half-seriously), thus the smiley. No worries.\n\nRegarding WAD, I think I would agree with that he was very instinctive in his work. And at the same time, he was very thoughtful. I think his thinking tended to follow his instincts. He could indeed be very right in his instincts and at the same time amazingly off-base in some of his ideas. But that is part of being a great thinker.\n\nDwiggins was a complicated mix of thinking and feeling, contemporary urges and historical respect. He even makes fun of himself in this regard through his alter-ego, H. Püterschein. In the Caledonia specimen, in \"Notes on the Designer\" Dwiggins-as-Püterschein writes about Dwiggins-the-designer, protesting that he is not really very \"modern\" at all:\n\n\"He creates an illusion of machines. But his machines are a masquerade. There are men inside of them. [. . .] Dwiggins pretends to love steel. He deceives nobody who _thinks_ steel. He deceives his friends -- Victorians like himself. He does not deceive _me_. . . . Dwiggins loves the forms of his youth -- split-rail fences, the dust of the road, shady farm-lanes, hills, clouds, sunshine, rain, a simple breed of semi-barbaric rural morons -- all the sentimental hogwash of the days when he was young.\"\n\nHe was a complicated and contradictory man.\n\n"

I can't keep up with you guys.\n\nChristian, I think it's overstating the case to say that Griffith \"struggled to pull him back.\" WAD was always concerned about the commercial viability of what he did. That didn't stop him from experimenting at all. But he was also always saying to Griff -- You tell me if there's any value in continuing this, or just put it \"in the attic\" (as he would say).\n\nThing is, as evidenced by the Charter and Winchester examples you mentioned, he was always pulling things back out of the attic and dusting off pet ideas, revisiting them again and again. You know . . . so many ideas, so little time.\n\nBut hey, it's a good thing he didn't have to draw every size and style and cast everything all himself, right?

His instincts led him to want to try out many things (some fairly outlandish) and he then experimented, displaying his deliberate and thoughtful nature. We can snort in derision at some ideas, but that's always the case looking at experimental pioneers of the past.\n\n"

He also respected WAD's analyses and theories. He was often asking WAD's opinion about other faces in production or sending him articles to comment on.\n\nHe did not always agree with all of WAD's theories. (I'm thinking about the long debate regarding approaches to fitting that I alluded to in another thread.) And I think CHG undoubtedly felt that some of WAD's design experiments were pretty outlandish, being a pretty practical man himself. But clearly, he felt that there was great value in having someone relatively unfettered in the MLCo camp doing the equivalent of \"R&D.\" In this regard, I think Griff deserves a lot of credit for being quite visionary.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
