I'm also planning on including a full sans-serif version of the family as soon as the slab version is completely worked out.   \n   \n ![fignuts01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414215728im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2682.jpg)\n\n",

Wish there was something in between 21 and 22.   \n   \nperhaps the regular and bold weights are a bit too close. Well the bold simply seems larger, not really heavier. wait a second, that's ext bold. there's no regular bold?   \n   \nhmm well the ext regular isin't as bold I guess but too wide. Its so hard finding a bitmap face that is clear, not bold, nor 1 line of pixels. Surely harder to design one. nice font though\n\n"
