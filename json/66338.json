      "content": "Hi Nick,\n\nWhen we originally set out about naming the font, we looked and couldn't find anything. We must of missed it!\n\nThe name actually refers to 'Earl Fortescue' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl\\_Fortescue](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074627/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Fortescue \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl\\_Fortescue\")  \nThis is due to the typeface originally being created for an artist who resided at Fortescue House (The House in Devon in which Earl Fortescue lived).\n\nAgain, as hrant says, they look completely different, it just happens to be a coincidence about the names sounding similar.\n\n- Colophon\n\n"
