More samples and letters [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418193650/http:/www.marcolini-eboutique.com/en-en/tablets-and-treats?category=Tablets(Marcolini-Base)). Reminds me of [Trajan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418193650/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/trajan) (/N missing top left serif /N, /M slopping verticals) but that's clearly not it. Some more I like: [Minerva Antiqua](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418193650/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/minerva), [Orpheus](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418193650/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/orpheus-pro).\n\n"
