      "content": "I think most of it is based on Harrington (a.k.a Hermosa). It's an old Art Nouveau era design that Microsoft and Richard Beatty (and probably Scriptorium) have digitized. I can probably find a link for one of them.   \n   \nOnly the looping 'l' looks really new, and the crescent dot on the i. The 'a' has been truncated to remove the serif, so it didn't clash with the r, and a tail has been added to the e in an attempt to make it connect with the 'r'.\n\n"

I also found the Identifont page on [Harrington](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123004433/http:/www.identifont.com/show?1ND). I got my copy of Harrington in a Microsoft TrueType Master Set for Macintosh in 1994.\n\n"
