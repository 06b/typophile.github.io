That's your job innit?\"\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202130846im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-bw_3579.gif)\n\nIt _could_ be a custom job; however, I rate that as unlikely, given the subtleties -- the left and right leg of the \"U\" are of slightly different widths, and the \"N\" has some surprising curves I just know I've seen before (perhaps Friz Quadratish?). OTOH, I'm not too wild about those \"E\" and \"F\"s. Still, I'd like to know.\n\n",
