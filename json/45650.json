There are plenty of them out there, mostly for cyrillic, some have latin characters \"old-cyrillicised\" bundled with them as well.\n\nMost of the fonts you'll find though will be of poor quality, having been made by enthusiasts in the 90 (not to say all, I'm sure you can find nice ones as well).\n\n"
