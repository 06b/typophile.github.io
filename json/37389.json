  "content": "Dear all\n\nAkzidenz Grotesk........ I am in the process of collecting a body of research relating to this pivotal sanserif,  \nI have used the info from a recent help request, so thanks to all who donated.\n\nI am still slightly confused over the name, the question I raise is,  \n1. Does Grotesk, in German mean sanserif, or just simply grotesque (Eng.), if so, this can be taken to imply misshapen, malformed ugly etc. Its seem pretty regular to me and not at all ugly ?  \nAn earlier thread I had read ( in part ) seemed to indicate a meaning for Akzidentz which would convey a chance discovery.\n\nAny ideas or thoughts will be greatly received.\n\nAlan\n\n [‹ Type and Brand Consistency](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033404/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37550 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for Linotype FontExplorer X for Windows ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033404/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37554 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Tried to make one myself but it doesn’t look so good.\n\nLet’s see something if you have already!\n\nGood Luck  \nStefan\n\n"

I think this designation is indeed the result of the sans serif faces as being felt to be _strange_ compared to the usual and common serif faces of the time.  \nWouldn’t “sans serif” rather go by “serifenlose Linearantiqua” (at least that’s what I learned in typography class).\n\n"

I say strange because my family come from a part of London not far away from where he had his foundry and our names are similar.\n\nre the “Grotesk” meaning I think Jan has hit the nail, so to speak ! I wonder if the idea was, this new face was so “modern” Berthold jokingly played along ?  \nA friend of mine who is taking typography degree intimated similar\n\nMany thanks to all who have contributed\n\nAlan\n\n"

      "content": "Dear Alan!\n\nRegarding » Grotesk « as German native speaker (as you may note my English skills are worst) I have a few additional remarks.\n\nIn german we have (had) three modes to name a »Sans Serif«:\n\nGrotesk  \nSans Serif  \nserifenlose (= Sans Serif) (Linear-) Antiqua\n\nThe semantic origin of the term » Grotesk « is the French language of the 17th century. The term (grotesque) first was used in visual arts to express an unnatural combination of parts of humans, animals and plants. This term etymologically was borrowed from the Italian » grottesco « = » part of a cave «, meaning antique cave paintings, antique cuneiform writing etc.\n\nIn 1832 the London typesetter and type founder Vincent Figgins (1766–1844) created a typeface (only uppercase) called » Two-line Great Primer Sans-serif «. He was the first using the term » Sans Serif «. In the same year William Thorowgood published a typeface (uppercase and lowercase) which became known as » grotesque «.\n\nArround 1880 the German Typesetter Ferdinand Theinhard created a four weights typeface called » Royal Grotesk « for publications of the » Königlich-Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin « (Royal Prussian Academy of Science Berlin). This was the moment when the » Grotesk « became popular in Germany. 1908 Herman Berthold took over the Theinhard Foundry and continued to sell the » Royal Grotesk « till the end of the monarchy in 1918. After that Berthold sold the » Royal Grotesk « as » Akzidenz Grotesk «.\n\nVertex\n\n"
