      "content": "Perhaps you could find a reasonably close base font -- perhaps a Clarendon -- adjust it to conform to your image, and tack on the medial spurs. A couple of candidates are: Ultra Pro [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stiggy-sands/ultra-pro/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030045442/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/stiggy-sands/ultra-pro/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stiggy-sands/ultra-pro/\") Hint: shave off about 1/10 of the height from top and bottom, then compress the width and thicken the cross strokes. Cowboy Rodeo [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030045442/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo/\") Hint: shave off a little less, compress width , thicken the cross strokes and tack a serif on the top of the A.  \nHope this is actually a font and someone spots it for you.  \nDon\n\n"
