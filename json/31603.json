  "content": "Hi,\n\nSoon I'am going to bought the FontBook, but I would like to know if in the book they describe the fonts by categori.\n\nWhat I try to say by describing fonts is, example :\n\n**Digital :**\n\nMatrix;  \nMrs Eaves;  \nOut West.\n\n**Old Style :**\n\nGaramond;  \nCaslon;  \nBembo.\n\n**Modern :**\n\nGill Sans;  \nFutura;  \nFrutiger;  \nUnivers.\n\n**Transitional :**\n\nBaskerville;  \nBodoni.\n\nWhat I'am trying to say, I'am not able all the time to categorise a font, and a book who tell me this font is a modern font etc. are going to help me.\n\nI dont know if you understand what I mean ?\n\n",

      "content": "Yes, far more than one book. There are different classificatory systems. For example, Mrs. Eaves is a revival of Baskerville -- or maybe \"inspired\" by Baskerville? So, is it \"digital\" or \"transitional\" in your system? The three you term \"old style\" I would break into different categories, with, for example, Bembo being a Venetian.\n\nPeople classify fonts for varying reasons, so no one system is right or wrong.\n\n"

Classification systems are very much a subject of debate, as is which typefaces go where, so it's really up to you to nitpick for yourself.\n\n"
