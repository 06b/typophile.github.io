But when working on a six digit project it's \"Yes sir, Mr. Hale. Would you like coffee with that Mr. Hale? How high again did you ask us to jump?\"\n\nI've seen this time and again, whether it be web design, a custom font project, book or brochure. Where, financially or otherwise, do you draw the line?\n\n",

He said the Ford PR guys first flew him up to Detroit to see the glitzy airbrush takes on a new logo they had done to show him their \"ideas\" for a logo. It was a big bash with spotlights and fanfares. Randy said, \"I told them to take me back to the airport and call me when they were serious about the identity project.\"\n\nPaul Rand could get away with that, you and I would have been dumped at the bus station.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

I’ve gotten burned too many times by people at nonprofits who jerk volunteers around every chance they get because it never costs them any money. The last straw was with a guy who would make appointments with me and not even be in the building when I arrived. The next time I want to volunteer I’m just going to go clean up at an animal shelter—at least the dogs appreciate the help.\n\n"

So yeah, no surprises there there, Dan.\n\nScrew the economy. Everyone wants to squeeze a little more blood and blame it on the economy. It's way too easy. Sure things are tough, but things cost what they cost, and a good design job is not a luxury. I think that (with the option of being more flexible in your back pocket), you lean as far in the direction of \"call me when you are serious\" as possible. I've been learning you don't get a lot of respect for being agreeable. Even less for being cheap and agreeable?  \n…  \n-=®=-\n\n"
