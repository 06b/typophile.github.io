Excellent looking forum!\n\nI would like help identifying the font attached.\n\nDoes anyone know what that is or can you suggest me any \\*preferably\\* free fonts that match this font style (not necessarily exactly the same). I am looking for the handwritten script style font and specifically the joined up style of the J and all subsequent letters in the attached picture.\n\nMany thanks to any of you who can help contribute.\n\nDavid\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071129212445im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/jones_logo_3579.png)\n\n [‹ pet boutique](http://web.archive.org/web/20071129212445/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39503 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [help with newspaper faces ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071129212445/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39494 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
