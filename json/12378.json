Just make sure you let it finish its initial indexing before you do any serious work.\n\nQuartz Composer (which comes with the developers’ tools) is very cool. You can design and play back complex animations and effects that render right on the graphics processor.\n\nI haven’t heard of any bungled Tiger upgrades, Vince. If you’re having trouble, talk to Apple. They didn’t get ranked #1 in computer customer service by hanging customers out to dry.\n\n"

Something has caused some file access problems with a few of your applications. You shouldn’t need to reinstall anything. If you are unable to download and install a new program like Cocktail, then boot your Mac off the original OS X CD that came with it and run the Disk Utility from the CD. It will allow you to repair permissions at least.\n\n"
