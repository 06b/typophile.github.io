  "content": "I'm primarily looking for feedback on name legibility at this point. Being that the type is hand drawn, and the word is uncommon, I'm worried about the viewer's ability to pick up the name. How well does it read, and what do you read? Any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n\nJim\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013093533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TK-Wordmark-Test_3434.jpg)\n\n",
