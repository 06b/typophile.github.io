  "content": "Hi,\n\ni'm doing a magazine and i wanted to use Big Caslon italic as a display font because of it swashes and elegance in bigger sizes, compared to adobe caslon pro italic.  \nAnyone knows if it is still wallpaper's exclusive font?  \nCan i buy it anywhere? Or can you think of any alternative fonts?\n\nAnd do you know an elegant dingbats font i could use with it? i need an elegant pointing hand...\n\nthan you,\n\njonas\n\n",
