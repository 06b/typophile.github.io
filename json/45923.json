I can’t remember who has used a logo like this.\n\nI;m working on a logo at work, and want to avoid it looking the logo I’ve seen before. Any ideas?\n\nthanks!\n\nJonathan\n\n [‹ So I am finishing a logo and the client wants to pay more.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906192738/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45789 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [picto font with glyph for assistance/security/staffed area ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906192738/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46019 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
