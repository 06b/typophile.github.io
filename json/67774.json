To my (amateur) eye it's fresh, non-authoritarian, and has a sense play - all things I would like to convey.\n\nDoes anybody have any other suggestions?\n\n",

Clearly, you don't want, say, Wedding Text, since that would produce the opposite of the effect you are pursuing.\n\nMurray Hill and Park Avenue aren't right either; but I would be inclined to suggest some sort of light, playful face that still makes a nod to the past by being calligraphic. But I can't find what I'm thinking of, although Tiffany, Bauhaus, or Korinna might (or might not) work for you.\n\n"

What do you think of Pelagian Pro?\n\n@ cuttlefish - Beorcana is absolutely lovely and, dare I say, near perfect for this project.\n\n@ Northbay - Caslon No540 is great but I think I'm going to go the sans serif route.\n\nThanks again. I will let you all know what I decide.\n\n"
