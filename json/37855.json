Manager of the project was René Kerfante. I was the design cosultant and designed the literature for the launch in 1983. Lots of small ads for the trade press, spelling HELVETICA, a weight a letter. And a brochure in A4. I was also involved in the discussions about applying the Univers nomenclature to Helvetica. Wolfgang Schimpf was the man who, in 1985, oversaw the digitization of PT55, later to be released as FF Meta.\n\n"
