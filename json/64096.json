  "content": "I am trying to use the DTP Naskh OT font in InDesign. The problem we are facing is that the tops of the vowels do not align flush to the top of the text box. There is a small amount of white space that remains at the top of each page. This is not a problem with the Lotus Linotype font which is always flush to the top.\n\nCan anyone help. Much appreciated.  \nAbdur\n\n",
