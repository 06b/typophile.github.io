  "content": "I have begun designing a new typeface of mine. It is my first font ever made and my first experience with FontCreator, so keep that in mind when critiquing.\n\nI have a ton of concept work for many of the other glyphs, so I could scan them in and post them if anyone wants. I'd appreciate it if the time was taken to evaluate some of the other glyphs that didnt make it or are being saved for alternates and flourishes and whatnot. I plan on making this a full font. Including diacritics, dipthongs, currency symbols, etc etc. No cutting corners.\n\n[Here is the link to the project on behance.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222412/http:/typophile.com/wiki/www.behance.net/gallery/Leteske/7016789)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Leteske.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222412/http:/typophile.com/files/Leteske.png) | 129.29 KB |\n\n",
