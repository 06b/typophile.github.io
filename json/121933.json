  "content": "I need to find a super-condensed bold typeface for the cover of a small format paperback book. The cover is type-only and some of it will be spot laminated, so it needs to be very chunky. And we want to set the type very large.  \nAt the moment we're using Bureau Grot compressed book, which is lovely, but feels a little too old and traditional. The book is about the art world, so it needs to look elegant but we'd like it to also look really fashionable/youthful. Someone suggested going for something more like Macula which looks fashionable, unusual, playful -- all good -- but it's not condensed enough to set at a really big size.  \nCan anyone suggest some attention-grabbing alternatives that have the required height and chunkiness?\n\nAny help much appreciated -- thank you!\n\n",
