They’d listen to you.\" Unsurprisingly, I have been in touch, and have had a substantial email chat with the relevant PM at Microsoft. I can't really discuss it, except to say that all the OpenType UI/feature decisions are being made carefully and deliberately. It's not as if they just didn't talk to the right people or some such.\n\nGus: Insert Symbol will only work with encoded characters, not alternates, AFAIK. So it would potentially work (and presumably already did) with those fonts where the alternates are themselves given PUA codepoints, as Adobe used to do. Indeed, that was the main argument for such PUA encoding of glyphs properly left unencoded. But Adobe has abandoned that practice in recent fonts, and Microsoft and many others never used it in theirs, so with those fonts \"Insert Symbol\" probably won't help.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
