Instead I feel what's involved is the matching of a \"mood\": what Arabic font evokes to Arabs what Trajan evokes to Westerners? Maybe a thulooth. But that's hard to pull off with a font... So instead a particularly traditional Nasta'leeq perhaps.\n\nBTW Aziz, where do the outlines of the Latin component of Muslimah come from?\n\nhhp\n\n"
