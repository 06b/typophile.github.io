  "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nHas anyone noticed that it is difficult to set body text in Soho Regular?\n\nFor me Regular it seems a bit to dark, whereas Light does the job much better. Also, probably due to the large x-height the Auto leading value of 120% is way too tight. Although, I think the large x-height is also responsible for high legibility and readability in small sizes, which is a good thing.\n\nMy own experimentation led me to a decision of using Soho Light 7.5/11.5 pt or 8/12 pt for body text.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience working with this typeface? Any comments/tips?\n\n",
