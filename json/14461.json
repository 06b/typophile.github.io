I may be coming to a town near you! San Francisco residents need particularly be scared as I am making my new nest in the fine city of San Fran. You all may never be the same.

The difference is in comparison to where I’m from, there seem to be only “designated places where nature is allowed” in New York. Where I’m from, its just always there.

I’d encourage your efforts to improve BART, but BART and MUNI are the gateways to madness: every station is a jumble of conflicting type, signage, branding, and architecture. Looking around trying to figure out how to fix everything will explode your brain. I prefer to watch the mice scamper around underneath the tracks. It’s soothing.\n\nAfter New York, San Francisco can seem a little parochial, but we have awesome sushi, [two](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829111225/http:/www.amoebamusic.com/) of the [most](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829111225/http:/www.aquariusrecords.org/) amazing record stores in the United States, if not the world, and some of the most freakishly unvarying weather I’ve ever seen (opinions vary on the last). Also, we have entertaining politics. And I guess we have the nature too, although the good stuff is further away than you might think.\n\nAnd of course, we have [William Stout](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829111225/http:/www.stoutbooks.com/). Leave your wallet at home the first time you visit. I didn’t, and I was sorry (although not very).\n\n"
