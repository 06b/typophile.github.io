  "content": "I've been mulling over Kabel for some time now, and yesterday I decided to jump in, and do my version of Kabel-isque font. It has no metric or proportional or direct design of Kabel, since I keep finding issues with the original. The fact is I really like the overall feel of Kabel, but when I take a closer look, it just throws me off.\n\nSo, I decided to make my own version:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225231im_/http:/typophile.com/files/test_5329.png)\n  \nThis is medium weight, and there'll be five or six other weights.\n\nIt has pretty much the same feel as Kabel, but now I can live with the glyph design as well. This is less than two days' work, so be gentle, but what do you think? I already know that uc M and lc g need work.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225231/http:/typophile.com/files/sample_12.pdf) | 92.51 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I see your points, but in my opinion, I've made a whole new and differet version of Kabel with different x-height, weight(s), and with quite a few totally different glyphs. As you can see here, the ITC and Adobe/Linotype versions are pretty different from each other, as well as my take is very different from them:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225231im_/http:/typophile.com/files/test1_3475.png)\n\nHere is glyph 'a' with my design, then ITC and then Adobe with same point size:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225231im_/http:/typophile.com/files/testi2_5098.png)\n\nI found ITC x-height way too tall, and Adobe too small, so determined mine to my liking. Also, glyphs 'n, 'm', 'h' and 'u' have sharp connection instead of smooth like in 'a' above; and there are many more differences over the whole character set.  \nI've gone through my sample books, and both Adobe and ITC have taken some liberties from the Koch original. I think the most honest to original fonts is Elsner + Flake versions.\n\n"

Yes I agree that  \nITC Kabel with its huge x-height is a parody of Koch's original.  \nBut the small x-height of Koch's type – meaning tall ascenders  \nand descenders – made it very elegant.\n\nThe sharp rather then rounded connection of your a is a design feature  \nthat could also be applied to b d p and q.\n\nAnd what will this face be called?\n\n"

      "content": "Yes; the small x-height does make Kabel very elegant. I want my version to go in the middle area between these existing designs. And I like some of the seventies posters made with ITC Kabel with the heavier weights, so I think I'm keeping the current x-height. (I might make a tall ascender/descender version as well…)\n\nI did try out the sharp connections for b,d,p and q as well, but when I tried that on the 'b', I wanted to keep it in Bauhaus-style, so it looked somewhat wonky. Therefore round connections.\n\nAs for the name, I'm undecided. Any suggestions? STF Kabel? Tabel?\n\n"

A big part of the art of type design has to do with compensating for visual illusions like this. Making things _look_ consistent is more important than having them _be_ consistent.\n\nIt's your design and your decision, but I think you should consider it.\n\n"

I think you'd find it very interesting and maybe helpful.\n\nI think you have some problems with widths. Your a to me is too narrow for the rest of the design, particularly the e. Tracy criticizes the original m as too narrow. Here you have also made the n h u narrow as well, which I think is going to cause problems for good rhythm in words. The usual view, as expressed in Tracy's discussion of spacing, is that the counters in the h and o need to be not so different in volume.\n\nI think you are right that Kabel has a lot of merits, but also problems in the lower case. But I think you need to work on the end result having more even rhythm, if the revision is going to be successful.\n\n"

I've never really liked Kabel either, always rubbed me the wrong way, but I like this.\n\nI don't have much to say as I don't feel nearly as experienced as others on this forum, but I will comment that I notice the round lowercase letters seem to look bigger in comparison to the other lowercase letters as the font gets lighter. This seems to be a result of all of the letters except the round ones thinning in character width with the weight loss. The o's not too bad, but the p, q, d and b look huge. Perhaps bring the stems in closer and loose the full circle? I know that kinda ruins the integrity of the font style but it might help create a more consistent color across the light weights.\n\nNice work on this. I'm amazed thinking of the amount of work that must go into this that you make look so easy with a few image posts on a forum.\n\n"

That's why I made my version.\n\nIn my opinion the optical difference in height with light and heavy are of no concern; have you ever seen those weights been used next to each other? Basic rule with large families is to leave one weight in between for emphasis; so, for light, use medium as an highlight weight, and for book, use bold, and for medium use heavy.\n\nThat is why I've decided not to change the ratios of x-height and des- and ascenders.\n\n"

Adjusting the ratios would be difficult. \n"
