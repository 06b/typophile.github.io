For the rest of you unlucky souls who will not be attendance, watch the [FontFeed](http://web.archive.org/web/20121102080456/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontfeed) for updates as the shipping date draws near. We'll be describing there some of the changes and improvements in this edition. There are many.\n\n"
