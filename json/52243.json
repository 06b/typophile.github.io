Although Klavika is already relatively narrow, the new width needed to accommodate an industry that transmits large amounts of complex information in tight spaces and relishes the big, bold headline. After two years of exclusive use by Chevrolet, the retail release of Klavika Condensed is finally available. \n\nPurchase the complete family - which includes Light, Regular, Medium and Bold weights each with corresponding italics and an extended Latin character set - or purchase only the single weight you need directly from our website.\n\nSee more of Klavika Condensed:  \n [http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavikacon/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017235635/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavikacon/ \"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavikacon/\")\n\n",
