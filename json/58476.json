  "content": "I’m trying to remember the name of a typeface I saw not too long ago on the type ID board (I don’t remember anything else about the context except what the face looked like).\n\nClues:\n\n• It is an unbracketed slab serif of medium weight  \n• It is **quite** extended  \n• The capital K splits like a Helvetica K  \n• The capital J has a ball terminal  \n• The capital R’s leg hooks up in the Clarendon fashion\n\nBonus clue:\n\n• I also saw it recently on one of my grandmother’s circular Springbok puzzles. The puzzle dates back to 1965, so the face is predigital.\n\n",
