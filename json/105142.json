I've tried to fit a font next to them but have been unsuccesful and specified which font I was using trying to fit the texts.\n\nPlease, can you help me out identifying the fonts?\n\nThank you in advance\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426231502/http:/typophile.com/files/1_80.jpg) | 18.84 KB |\n| [2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426231502/http:/typophile.com/files/2_56.jpg) | 43.95 KB |\n| [3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426231502/http:/typophile.com/files/3_29.jpg) | 17.8 KB |\n\n",
