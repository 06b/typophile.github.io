Any anwers are welcome.\n\nthanx\n\n"

      "content": "Speaking of spacing, have you done tests using HH\\_HOHO\\_OO? Your \"O\"s seem way to airy and larger in size compared to the rest, The \"E\" seems to have a different SB than the \"H\" (look at \"THE\") and there seems to be a lot of weight balancing issues. I would like to see the letter combos in the HH...OO combo before I make a final comment.\n\nAt first glance, I think the diagonal are all too heavy(M,N,A,V), or the verticals are too light(H,L,) in the major stroke weight.\n\nAnd I think the secondary stroke weight for the \"A\" isn't working with the secondary strokes of the rounds like \"S\" or in transitions from round to vertical like the \"R\".\n\nDo you have unit numbers for these things? As much as type design is a creative discipline, it requires a lot of constancy and precision.\n\n"

Some museums address the history and artifacts of space exploration as well [free web host](http://web.archive.org/), illustrating the close association between aeronautics and astronautics.\n\n"

Not a bad achievement for a spam bot, but that non-sequitur link is an instant tell.\n\nThere are definitely some spacing issues with the round letters, and the S looks too narrow among the rest. Of course this is all stuff from two years ago that was plowed up by a spam bot, so you may have resolved those issues long ago.\n\n"

      "content": "Jason is right; S looks too narrow, and so does L. To my eye, A, H, N and U are too wide. And the lower leg of K should bend in only one direction. Now it's sort of trying to go in both directions. I would make it bend down, and lose that start of a serif, just leave an angle at baseline or overshoot.\n\nThis is just after a quick look, but I see that you want to make a brake from Trajan style, with some hints remaining, and it pretty much works. Just don't over-do it.\n\n"
