As with previous major type releases, we invited some very talented artists to collaborate on the **[PDF type guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012071517/http:/www.veer.com/download/pdf/burguesscript.pdf)**. Thanks to Horacio Lardies, Florencia Kohan, Mariano Lopez Hiriart and Jose Ignacio Fernandez, who illustrated the words that Alejandro Paul designed.\n\n",
