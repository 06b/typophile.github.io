I find the face itself quite distracting, as though it’s fighting with itself to decide what to be (“I want to be a display face! Oh, wait, no, too scary standing out, I’ll be the weird kid instead.”) if you know what I mean?\n\nNo idea where I’m going with this, other than - thoughts? It \\*is\\* a good book, I’m just finding it hard going reading it. Has an interest in typography really come the point of visual aesthetics over content?\n\nI’ll go away now.. :)\n\n [‹ \"What tha Font?\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060205/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37968 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Co-Starring Futura ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060205/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37962 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Within the more modest range of good “transparent” text typefaces there is still plenty of diversity for variations in the tone the typographer wants to convey.\n\n"

A quirky—more so in the Light—but not unattractive typeface, the serifs are a distraction. Choosing a typeface such as that for main body text makes the book about the design (form), as opposed to the subject (substance).\n\n"

(A point well made in the Speikerman short in regard to groceries.) And yes, what \\*would\\* you use if you were to write a novel? As a book designer do you have a solid set of guaranteed fonts you’d fall back on and run into a burning office to save?\n\nAs a designer - not books may I hasten to add - I do appreciate the publishers trying something new; and as a face per se I quite like Sovereign - I just wasn’t expecting to see it there, mixed with another indented serif (I think Garamond) when Thomas switched between narration and citation.\n\nBut maybe like any new - almost rebranding I suppose - exercise should be tested out on us, the great unwashed before being released into the wild? Does such a practise exist, or is book publishing centred upon fail safes and tradition or what the design team like?\n\n"

I quite liked it while I was working on it, but now with the benefit of hindsight, (and not seeing it for a while) I’m not keen at all!\n\nAnyway, you will not have to suffer it very often; it hardly sells any copies at all! So that’s good!\n\nI can only apologise from the bottom of my heart and promise to only design good typefaces in the future.\n\nI just Googled it - the book also uses Geetype - any adverse comments on that?\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

I read a book recently that was justified with no hyphens. Some of the word spacing was absurdly loose.\n\nBut nothing more so than the problem I’m facing right now - I accidentally ordered the large print edition of a book recently from Amazon. The type is probably at least 16 or 18 points, looks like a kid’s book. But it’s making the book a real page-turner.\n\n"
