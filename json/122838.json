  "content": "Hi  \nI adjusted the mark positioning lookup for my Arabic opentype font in VOLT. The shipped font works correctly in most applications in Mac, PC and ioS8 . However I discovered a case where problems occur: When exporting from Word 2013 to PDF the vertical mark positions are not adjusted at all, and they stay in their default positions. This does not occur in a font like Arial, as seen to the bottom of the illustration.  \nAny suggestions to solve this welcome  \nvladimir\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [image.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317130801/http:/typophile.com/files/image_241.jpg) | 277.54 KB |\n\n",
