  "content": "Hi everyone,  \nI just moved to Portland so I don't know much about the city.\n\nI'm here to ask if you guys know any specialty offset printer in Portland that is able to print posters on archival quality paper?\n\nSo far I have:  \n [http://www.pinballpublishing.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131103327/http:/www.pinballpublishing.com/ \"http://www.pinballpublishing.com\")\n\nand\n\n[http://www.stumptownprinters.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131103327/http:/www.stumptownprinters.com/ \"http://www.stumptownprinters.com\")\n\nHowever, these two shops offer 1-color offset printing. I'm looking into something like 4 to 6 color offset printing for a limited edition poster I have in mind (500 copies).\n\nI would love to have a local printer here so that I can go there and get my hands on production as well as giving them insight on my specific needs.\n\nThank you very much!\n\nOh, and I would love to get together with fellow typophiles in order to get to know a little more the city and the people.\n\n",
