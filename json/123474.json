  "content": "Hi!\n\nI'm trying to find the ID/name/designer of this typeface. Honestly, I'm a bit unsure of weather or not it even exists outside of this context, or if it was costumed for this LP, considering the odd combo of lowercase and small caps, and seeing as this image is the only source i can find on it?\n\nEven if you don't know the name, but can confirm that you have seen it before, meaning that it (or some form of it) does exist as an available font, would be helpful :)\n\nAny help at all is greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nsource:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414175629im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-25%20at%2000_5157.38.37.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Custom lettering \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [George Thomas](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414175629/http:/typophile.com/user/803 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
