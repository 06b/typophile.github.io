Why – of all possible careers – type?\n\nI love working in type because, well, I love type. I love the history, the mechanics, and I love the environments in which it is used. I’ll even look at \\*evil\\* ads if they use good type or a new face well. I also love the people in the type community, and respect so much of their work. Also, I love to read; I read everything. During Michael Twyman’s lectures earlier this year in Reading, he used to yell at me for trying to read everything in the ephemera samplse on the table instead of looking at them properly. Even if I didn’t work in type, I’d still look at letters and old books all day, trying to doodle their forms properly in a notebook…\n\n"
