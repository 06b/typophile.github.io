      "content": "The method I use to be certain it is going to print is to create it in Illustrator (or a similar vector graphic program), outline and import it in Quark. Even if a printer can print out the Quark formatting there is no guarantee that it will remain formatted when it goes to film/plate. As a general rule I steer clear of all the formatting options for type for Quark.\n\n"

      "content": "As a general rule, I do as well. In this instance we've created an obliqued version of the face in Fontographer, which isn't beautiful but will do the trick.   \n   \nFor future reference, can anyone explain what it is _technically_ that allows only some fonts to be \"italicized\"?\n\n"
