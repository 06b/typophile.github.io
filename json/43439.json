  "content": "Hi,\n\nI recently posted a problem regarding an Opentype font (dearJoe 4) which seemed to be problematic when used in Word. Since then a couple of new problems have arised which are of a different nature and so my previous post’s title doesn’t quite fit the problem anymore. Since the previous post only got one reply I thought it might be a good idea to post this again, with a title that suits the problem better.\n\nSo here’s the problems:\n\n“In Word:  \nThe font is listed (in it’s style). When I select the font, the resulting type in the font window and the document says dear Joe 4, but looks like a standard font. It appears that it is not reading the font file, but is automatically substituting another font.\n\nIn Photoshop:  \nThe font name does not even appear in the list.\n\nIn Corel Draw:  \nThe font name appears in the list and the font works fine.”\n\nAnd also:\n\n“Testing the TrueType format of the DearJoe Four font in my Win2000 system using Publisher2000 and get an error message saying the font is not available on my system, however, when I selected ’use it anyway’ I was able to continue and use the font without fault.\n\nUsing the font in a variety of alternate applications I found the font to function as expected, without fault.\n\n~however~\n\nTesting the font in a WinXP system in Publisher2003 I’m experiencing similar ’not available’ errors, however, I’m not getting the proper font when selecting ’use it anyway’”\n\nSo obviously there’s something wrong with the font...  \nI have generated the font the same way as I always do and this problem has never occured. I just can’t figure out where the problem is. Maybe it’s got something to do with the fact that the font has A LOT of kerning pairs, but please, if someone would be so kind to check this font I’d be happy to send the file to them.\n\nThanks in advance and best regards,\n\n [‹ AFDKO doesn't work with Python 2.5](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907045643/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43848 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking to hire typographic designer... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907045643/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43883 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If you are seeing a different font in Word, that usually indicates that RichEdit thinks the font is unsuitable for the language you are trying to type, which may be due to incorrectly set codepage support in the OS/2 table. That would explain why the font might work okay in some other apps, which might not be performing the same checks as RichEdit.\n\n"
