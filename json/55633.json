The mark is based on the V and it is meant to resemble flipped over A as well as incorporate a form of an arrow indicating a motion (of either stashing the files or recovering them).\n\nThoughts ? Good/bad/blah/interesting/unremarkable/etc ?\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013163434im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bvckup-2-b_5257.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013163434im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bvckup_4998.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Ha, a \"V1\". Interesting, never saw it before you mentioned it. In the Serif thread someone said a \"fishing hook\", which was spot on, but also didn't occur to me at all before that.\n\nFor the second version I hoped that since the arrow is enclosed, it would refer to \"stashing\" of the data. Also the downward motion should associate with affixing or bolting something down, which in turn refers to the permanency, reliability and such. Not sure if the mark evokes any of these associations at all though...\n\nIn any case, I thought I'd post the full set. I personally like 2a, 1a, 3b and 1d, in this order.\n\nThe triangle based versions (esp. 1D) is a rendering of the \"shield\" concept, but again not sure if that's evident.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013163434im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jc-marks_4169.png)\n\n"
