  "content": "I have Quark 6.5 yelling every time I open an old order that uses a Helvetica Italic that has had its name changed to “a2Helvetica Italic” a1Helvetica is roman, a3Helvetica Bold and a4Helvetica BoldItalic all exist in this suitcase but the a2 face is missing its prnter font. I guess what I am asking is how to I alter the suitcase to include a helvetica italic so that docs print without asking for substitution? Also, if anyone out there is proficient in this, I would love to just pay someone to do this for the two fonts that I am having trouble with. Of all of our font library only a2Helv Italic and b2Times Italic are missing, but it is very important for my 9 typesetters to not have to think when sending proofs and plates each day. Right now, we call up a font by typing the letter and number combination a1,a2,f1,f2 etc for the different fonts and styles. Can anyone help in this -  \nThanks  \nJim Robidoux  \nBusiness Card Express  \nDerry, NH\n\n[jim@bcecards.com](mailto:jim@bcecards.com)\n\n [‹ I see, you see, we all see for an Iced T](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503074245/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18540 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Mark Time in a Coquettish way ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503074245/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18558 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
