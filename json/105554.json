      "content": "I concur in your find.  \nSo, how legitimate is WSI's Comix Regular?  \nI flipped though the Comicraft and Blambot collections but did not spot a match. But perhaps on closer examination? Another comic book/strip font publisher?  \nHere is internal font info:  \n-----------------------------------------  \nFont Name : Comix Regular  \nFont ID : 1865  \nFamily Name : Comix  \nSub Family Name: Regular  \nVersion : Publisher's Paradise -- Media Graphics International Inc.  \nPostScript Name : ComixRegular  \nFont Type : True Type  \nCopyright : From the WSI-Font Collection. Copyright (c)1993 W.S.I. All Rights Reserved.  \n-----------------------------------------\n\nAs for \"School Spirit\" it's the overused Comic Sans, which is installed as a core font on Microsoft windows.\n\nBy the way if you want an alternative to Comic Sans, you might try Comicraft's [Soliloquous](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050626/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/soliloquous/) and [Comicrazy](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050626/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/comicrazy/), Ron P. Dunant's [Architect Small Block](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050626/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/quietdesigns/architect-small-block/), or Robbie de Villiers' [Saycheez](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050626/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/wilton/saycheez/).  \nDon\n\n"
