It includes simple yet elegant type letterpressed on 100 percent cotton card stock. Now the design element I want to incorporate is the use of custom made rubber stamps of some of my \"type\" specimens and artwork. Since I will make several rubber stamps I'll have a few unique cards I can distribute to clients. I feel this will give the design a feeling of individuality and imagination. And if I ever get tired of a specific image I can just have new rubbrestamps made. What do you think?\n\n",
