  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am working on a logo design for a high tech venture which has many geometric circles and I wanted to try and find a sans-serif with rounded corners that would harmonize with the perfect circles in the logo design. I am presenting type treatments in U&lc as well as all caps. I would like the typeface to have a normal width, not too condensed or too expanded.\n\nI was thinking of Bryant or VAG rounded but I thought there might be better faces to match the perfect circles used in the logo design.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nRegards, Sal\n\n",
