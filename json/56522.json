  "content": "I'm creating some special characters to an existing font (with Fontographer 4.7.3) and met a new problem: I have no clue on how to add a new character! So far i have only created characters to already existing characters slots, but with this font there no \"extra slots\" left. Or techically, i seem unable to activate the truly empty ones (double-click isnt' working). So, is there a way to create those \\*\\*-key fonts in fontographer or should I finally move on to FontLab?\n\nAppriciate any help you guys can offer, right now i'm feeling very very stupid :-).\n\n[edit: posted originally to a wrong subforum]\n\n",
