  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've been tasked to find typefaces for a Japanese translation of an English book. In the English book, 3 typefaces are used:\n\nUnivers (Title, Body copy)  \nSabon (Subtitles)  \nCourier (Callouts)\n\nI need to find Japanese equivalents or substitutions for these typefaces.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on good Japanese typefaces or ways to go about finding the optimal Japanese substitutions?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "I'm not a Japanese expert but in my humble opinion, it's hard to call any fonts with Japanese support equivalents to Latin designs because of the writing style differences.\n\nHaving said that, I would suggest a gothic style for Univers and a Mincho style for a serif or Sabon.\n\nYou can get an idea of the styles available here:  \n [http://www.ascenderfonts.com/category/japanese-fonts.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029192437/http:/www.ascenderfonts.com/category/japanese-fonts.aspx \"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/category/japanese-fonts.aspx\")\n\n"

      "content": "Finding the Japanese equivalent of Courier is the interesting bit. Courier is used for many reasons. Sometimes, it is used to evoke the output of typewriters. Sometimes, it is used mainly because it is a monospaced font, especially to display code.\n\nNow, because most Japanese typefaces are monospaced anyway when it comes to the kana and the kanji, it's tricky to decide what to use for the translation when in the original Courier was used only because it is a monospaced font.\n\nI might be wrong, but I have the feeling that in Japan the Courier rough equivalent is probably the monolinear, rounded ナール(Nar). It's visually distinct from the Mincho or Gothic styles, and is quite widely used. I'm having trouble finding any information on it in English, though. Here's the Japanese Wikipedia page: [http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ナール](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029192437/http:/ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB)\n\n"

      "content": "I would browse the fonts at the Morisawa or Iwata websites. Your body font (the Univers equivalent) will probably be a basic Gothic of some kind. For the other two, you'll want to choose whatever fits the character of the book. Don't constrain yourself too closely to matching Sabon or (ugh) Courier.\n\n"

      "content": "It's hard to say the equivalents without seeing the design you try to make, but,\n\nIf you need to set Japanese font and Univers together in the same page, I recommend you use AXIS Font from [Type Project](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029192437/http:/www.typeproject.com/). AXIS Font covers wide range weights and has smart skeleton, each weight style of which was developed along with the one of Linotype Univers. Axis trial fonts are available to use from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029192437/http:/www.typeproject.com/trial/). The trial version font has only Regular weight and the limitation that Kanji have about 1000 characters only, but all Hiragana and Katakana characters are included, so you can check the looking of it before buying it. Of course, the retail version of AXIS Fonts have all Kanji characters (Adobe-Japan1-3).\n\nThe retail site is [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029192437/http:/www.axisfont.com/).  \nThis site is only Japanese language, but the customer support via Contact will answer your request in English.\n\nApple Japan uses AXIS fonts on its web site. You can also browse them [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029192437/http:/www.apple.com/jp/).\n\nSabon goes well with Mincho style. Kozuka Mincho from Adobe might be good for Sabon. And Kozuka and AXIS, both Kanas of these have similar skeleton, I think these work well together. Kozuka family has Gothic style but it has tiny serifs on the end of strokes, so I recommend AXIS for Gothic style.\n\nUnfortunately, almost of Japanese foundry don't support the order from overseas. However, Linotype deals with [Typebank family](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029192437/http:/www.linotype.com/289648/typebank-library.html), it would be helpful for you to get Japanese fonts quickly. Typebank Gothic and Mincho would be useful to combine with Univers and Sabon.\n\nWhich Courier, rounded or edged? Its hard to find the an equivalent of Courier. I can say rounded san-serif might be better, but Gothic would be also no problem for it.\n\nM+ 1m might be good for it, but it seems to be in progress now, so it doesn't have enough Kanji characters to set Japanese texts.\n\nI hope it would be helpful for you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nKunihiko Okano Shotype.com\n\n"

Sabon equivalent is not used often, but i realized is set in a multiplicity of styles (regular, bold, italic, bold italic). i will need to make some decisions about type based on the mincho selection. the courier type is the rounded version. the ナール(Nar) typeface seems to fit this purpose.\n\nthanks again.\n\n"
