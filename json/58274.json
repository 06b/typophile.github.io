Delphi?!?!! I'm impressed!\n\n[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/kvk/cte/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106213510/http:/www.oeaw.ac.at/kvk/cte/ \"http://www.oeaw.ac.at/kvk/cte/\")\n\nI am trying it now and having trouble getting the OpenType features to work, but I'm also using the Windows 7 beta. Let me know if you can control the features. To switch the rendering engine to OpenType, go to Format menu -\\> Document item -\\> Font tab, and switch the engine to OpenType. Then you will see OpenType feature checkboxes in the Format -\\> Font dialog.\n\nI recommend Vista for this. You can supposedly get to it in XP if you transplant the Vista version of Uniscribe, which is tedious yet possible.\n\n",
