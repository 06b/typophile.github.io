      "content": "I like the idea of cooking/serving good (tasty) design, Troy. But I am not sure if those quite rigid letters correspond to the very dinamic figure of a cook/waiter.   \n   \nMaybe you should try to keep this 30s-like composition, but combine it with a more contemporary font. It could communicate meaning like \"contemporary design served in a 30s manner\".\n\n"

(not a curly pig tail) i think his raised leg needs to be a little longer and maybe not curving up so much.   \n   \ni agree with tiffany wardle though, that the big circle takes away focus on the wonderful little guy. maybe avoid the circle and have 'design' going horizontal.   \n   \nalso, i think TASTY looks mis-scaled. try evening out the curve over the tops of the letters. make the second T smaller i think, and maybe move the Y left a bit....or do completely different tries with other fonts. you gotta do 20 to get 1.\n\n"

I will post another few possibilities soon.   \n   \nMy illustration was based on a piece of clip art I found in one of Dover's books -- which apparently was also the basis for the dingbat. I am curious about the issue of incorporating illustration work done by someone else -- do you think there's something wrong with that? Obviously it's in the public domain so I'm not stealing anything from anyone. Is there any difference between that and using another person's typeface design (which this is)?   \nIs it just because it's a logo? I see designs (including logos) all the time that obviously incorporate old artwork. (Art Chantry's work comes to mind.)   \n   \nI don't mean to argue with you, I sincerely am interested in what you think.   \n   \nMaybe it's better for me to explore type-only solutions (especially if the chef looks like a pig --ha!)   \n   \nThanks,   \n   \nTroy\n\n"

The problem is that you do not have exclusive rights to use it., so your neighbour may use the very same ilustration in his logo some day. In such a case you could have a tough time telling your clients that you \"serve\" original design done exclusively for them...\n\n"

      "content": "I think there was a miscommunication ... but Matjaz makes   \nthe point that Tiffany meant to make, I think, about the   \ndistinctiveness factor.   \n   \nJust taking that a step further. It isn't \\*probably\\* legal,   \nit's legal legal legal.   \n   \nI think the word \"discovered\" made it sound like you had   \ndone something wrong, which clearly, you didn't and   \nclearly that wasn't Tiffany's intention.   \n   \nAll that said ...   \n   \nI looked at your original intentions (non-corporate, entertainment focus)   \nand the Retro 30s look, imo, is not your strongest direction.   \n   \nThe Tasty type treatment is problematic because the   \nT and Y are rendered so small in comparison to the   \nother letters. I do enjoy the letterforms themselves.   \n   \nAnd the logo could just as well be for a caterer or cake designer.   \n   \nThe word \"Tasty\" is not the easiest thing to illustrate ...   \n   \nSometimes the solution just comes from sketching or   \nfiddling in Illustrator. When it doesn't come right away,   \none thing that I've found works is to try to pour out   \n26 solutions or 26 ideas in 26 minutes.   \nThe 26 can be thought of as arbitrary guide, but if you   \nget stuck, the specific letter can be an ideation catalyst.   \n   \nThese can be quick sketches or just words: waiter with serving tray.   \n   \nFrom those ideas, take a handful of your best and render   \nthem in pencil and go from there in illustrator.   \n   \nJust one approach, and of course, my opinions are just that. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111225639im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nPS, as far as use of images by Chantry, etc., Daniel previously   \nlinked this article from CreativePro.   \n   \n [http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/20305.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111225639/http:/www.creativepro.com/story/feature/20305.html)   \n   \n   \n   \nbj\n\n"

If its the 30's feel you are after maybe the word you are looking for isn't tasty, but Elegant might fit better. In either case follow PJ's advice, I once had a mortgage refi project and I presented 15 concepts, marker on paper, 75 concepts later I got the 3 that left the agency and i can tell you I'd still be working on them if I did it on a computer.\n\n"
