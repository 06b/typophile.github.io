      "content": "Updated:  \nMartina, which dates from the early 1990s, is apparently based on the photo-lettering era Filmotype Hudson. Some letters in Martina like \\_E\\_ and perhaps \\_A\\_ were alt letters in the Filmotype Hudson filmstrips. The alt \\_E\\_ is found in the digital Filmotype Hudson as an alt \\_E\\_, but it does not include an alt \\_A\\_ like the one in Martina. The Martina \\_A\\_ is either an alt \\_A\\_ that was in the filmstrips and was missed in the Filmotype digitization, or was created by editing \\_a\\_ when the digital Martina was made.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "Updated:  \nThere is also a font called Hudson which has the same \\_A\\_ as Martina, but the links from Identifont don't work. See [http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Hudson&q=Go](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317152605/http:/www.identifont.com/find?font=Hudson&q=Go \"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Hudson&q=Go\")  \nDon't know if this was pulled from sale because of legitimacy issues.  \nHudson is currently offered for sale as a FontSite Font. Again, I am not clear as to whether there are legitimacy issues.  \nFurther Update:  \nI checked both digital Martina and FontSite digital Hudson. The Digital outlines, node positions etc. are virtually identical so one is a clone of the other. Identifont states a 1992 copyright for Hudson by The Font Company. Internal information on the Hudson font now being sold by FontSite claims a copyright of 1996. Internal information on Martina claims copyright 1990-1993 FontBank, Inc. I have no idea which dates reflect reality and who copied whom.  \nDon\n\n"
