      "content": "the correct meaning of the word \"entasis\" is \"(being) in tension / tendency\"...   \nthe opposite of this term would be \"adraneia\" which means \"in-activity\"...   \n   \nanyway, if you say in greek that something is in \"entasis\", then you mean that something is very strong...   \n   \nso i don't know, if soren's explanation (in other words, 'entasis' is the conception of 'helping \"less\" to look \"the same\" by turning it into \"more\"') is okay...   \n   \n\"entasis\" is the phenomenon which leads to the action of the conception... and not the action itself...   \n   \nbut maybe i'm wrong and the danish altered the meaning of this term for their vocabulary...   \n   \n ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018115245im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nps: as far as for the dictionary, you will be amused to get to know what happened here in greece with the greek version of bringhurst's \"elements\"... george matthiopoulos and michael makrakis of the greek font society (gfs) who edited and translated this book, tried to introduce new typographic terms and invented some terms which didn't exist in greece... this lead of course to a discussion with some other \"experts\" on how correct the new terminology is and \"why using your term and not mine\"... greeks are so funny...\n\n"
