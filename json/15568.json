  "content": "We had a new logo done for our organization. The designer decided to set our org's name in Caslon all-caps. Aesthetically, I don't like it, but I'm at the point where I'm just happy to have a logo that the comittee approved so we can start using it.\n\nThat said, aesthetic preferences aside, the face just isn't suited for use online. When reduced to a suitable size for our site's banner, the contrast between thins and thicks become distracting as the thin strokes begin to dissappear.\n\nI've suggested some alternatives (they seem to like Minion Small Caps) but the designer is insistent on Caslon.\n\nCan anyone suggest a Caslon-ish face that isn't quite as extreme on the thin strokes?\n\n",
