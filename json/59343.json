But, I figured I would try anyways.\n\nI’ve lurked around for awhile and I know a bunch of the guys from LogoPond.com have recommended this site over and over gain. So, I decided to finally get off my ass and register.\n\nI live in San Francisco. I work for Pandora.com designing “digital brand experiences” for advertisers (that’s right, I am the guy that annoys you while you listen to music) and every once in awhile I take some brand identity projects on the side as well.\n\nI am slowly becoming a typeophile as I play ’Guess that Typeface’ while I walk down the street and make my own type treatments for logos.\n\nAnyways, that is all. Flame on.\n\n",

It takes a certain kind of genius to manipulate people and make them enjoy it. I knew what was happening, but I still clicked on that damn button and added “Volkswagon CC Radio” to my stations.\n\n"

The first thing I noticed when I joined was how unique of an advertising opportunity you guys have created by developing what you call a “digital brand experience”. What an innovative way to capture an audience at peak engagement. I actually took a look at your media kit to see your rates, but didn’t find any. Does Pandora have a separate rate card?\n\n"

As far as I know, generally our campaigns involve custom pitches. So, we negotiate premium CPMs based on the experience involved, whether we will be developing the creative, how long it’s running, etc. If you are interested in learning more for a campaign you’re working on I could have a sales person contact you :-)  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nNeed more distraction in your life?
