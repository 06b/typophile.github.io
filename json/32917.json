  "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nUniscribe and Devanagari (or any complex script): the glyph substitutions are not supported by InDesign.\n\nHas anyone written or heard of any conversion tool, that will analyze Uniscribe text (that is, text written in a complex script like Devanagari) and make all substitutions permanent (that is, the actual glyphs, rather than lookups for substitution, will be written), thus making the font useable in InDesign? So it would be a workaround for Indesign and Uniscribe. . .\n\nThanks.  \nMY\n\n",

This is a fact.\n\nThe OpenType font format was devised to support non-Latin scripts, especially the so-called \"[edited by moderator] scripts\".\n\nMerrian-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th edition, defines \"[edited by moderator]\" as \"a member of a socially disadvantaged class of persons\". Ten years ago, \"[edited by moderator]\" in Africa, India etc. were disadvantaged such that none of them was permitted to use any of their own scripts (Devanagari etc.) under Windows.\n\nSeven years ago, Microsoft implemented the OT support for \"[edited by moderator] scripts\" in Africa, India etc. as an integral component of all versions of Windows published since that time. Since many years, even the most elementary Windows programs (e.g. the simple one line editor \"Edit\") and also all freeware word processors (e.g. Open Office Writer) can handle \"[edited by moderator] scripts\".\n\nAs opposed to this, for the past ten years, Adobe has been intentionally preventing \"[edited by moderator]\" from using \"[edited by moderator] scripts\". Although the OT support for \"[edited by moderator] scripts\" is an integral component of Windows readily available to all application programs, Adobe wilfully blocked this Windows OT component so that \"[edited by moderator]\" in Africa, India etc. cannot use their own \"[edited by moderator] scripts\".\n\nConsidering that even the simplest one-line editor written by a hobby programmer permits \"[edited by moderator]s\" to use \"[edited by moderator] scripts\", there is no other explanation than that Adobe deliberatey prevents \"[edited by moderator]\" from using \"[edited by moderator] scripts\" for reasons of racism and apartheid.\n\n"

But I still hope that someone who is a programmer might have the interest and the genius to write some kind of code (be it a plug-in or anything else) that can make Uniscribe and InDesign become more friendly. Waiting for Adobe might be like waiting for Godot!\n\nWhy, actually, hasn't Adobe incorporated Uniscribe into InDesign? I hesitate to impute to Adobe the kind of sinister racist motives that another commenter has suggested. I imagine it would be one of two possible reasons: (i) it is actually very difficult to incorporate Uniscribe into InDesign, because the features of the one somehow conflict with the features of the other; or (ii) It is not economically viable: why spend money to develop a feature that will be used primarily by people who will not pay for it? (That is, at least in India, as I understand it, the vast majority of Adobe software users do not have licensed software: they buy it on the street corner or download it from pirate sites. (An aside: when we needed two licenses for InDesign, we put in an order with a software supplier in Kolkata, and waited over two months before we received the disks. Adobe doesn't make it easy to go legal in India!))\n\nWith best wishes  \nMY\n\n"

This means, that Adobe programmers, who are assumed to have more programming experience than young school kids would have no difficulty to display \"[edited by moderator] scripts\" in Adobe programs, if the Adobe outfit were willing to permit \"[edited by moderator]\" to use the \"[edited by moderator] scripts\" of their own mother tongues.\n\nTypophilers do not care that \"[edited by moderator]\" in Africa, India etc. cannot use their own \"[edited by moderator] scripts\". For instance, if Typophilers see this picture\n\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/[edited by moderator].jpg\n\nthe only thing they care about is to know the name of the typeface which was used for typesetting the headline. But Typophilers do not care that, for instance in India alone, there are more than one billion (1,000,000,000) speakers who want to use fonts for the scripts of their own mother tongues.\n\nBut Adobe deliberately prevents \"[edited by moderator]\" from using their mother tongue scripts.\n\nSo, \"[edited by moderator]\" who want to use InDesign will have to renounce their mother tongue.\n\n"

Uniscribe is a set of APIs for processing Unicode text, and applications have to deliberately make use of it, either directly or via a higher level set of APIs; it is not something that one blocks or allows, it is something one deliberately takes advantage of or chooses not to. And there are good reasons why developers might choose to 'roll their own', as Adobe have done, rather than making their application dependent on OS services that are outside of their control. One of the key reasons is, as I wrote, cross-platform compatibility. Yes, Windows and Mac both offer Indic text processing via system services, but they do so in incompatible ways using competing font layout formats. Adobe have a decade-old commitment to cross platform compatibility in their design apps, and that means waiting for them to assign resources to supporting language and script handling for specific markets.\n\nI'm the first person to say that I wish Adobe apps supported Devanagari and other Indian scripts, and also that we've been waiting much too long for this. I know Adobe have the know-how to implement this stuff, because I've worked with some of the people who would be responsible.

This illogical and complex positioning has to be obtained by the special technic inbuilt in the Rendering Engines of Operating System. (In case of Windows : Unicows.dll and USP10.dll etc. i.e. Uniscribe or Unicode Script Processor)\n\nWhereas the scope of a PageLayout program like Adobe InDesign should remain limited upto the OT Fonts (i.e. glyphs). Even if in Edit mode the text is rendered in traditional/desired form with the help of rendering engine of Operating system, but when the layout output in Unicode will be sent to the printer(Postscript, or color separation processing units), the repossitioned glyphs gets distorted, because there the rendering engine does not work or save the balance between sequences of Encoded characters and repositioned sequences of glyphs of OT fonts.\n\nMore, the output not necessirialy to be get with that particualr OS (like Windows) only, user should have freedom to get it with any OS. Or the layout-output must be OS independent.\n\nI think this is the policy of Adobe, the great IT gaint must finding some OS independent tech. for their products like InDesign.\n\nSo I propose a solve, atleast may be for presently/temporarily, as :\n\n(1)  \nFor Print media  \nIn Hindi (or other Indic) in Unicoded OT fonts:\n\n-- 1st Compose with Layout in Unicoded OT fonts (with Rendering Engine help)  \n-- Then make a PDF of the pages with option of \"inlcude OT fonts\"  \n (As PDF uses only sequence-wise glyphs of a OT font, does not use the Unicode character code sequences, as there is no need to futher processing)  \n-- Then send the PDF for print or pre-print processing.\n\n(2)\n\nDesign/Develop Hindi (or other Indic) OT Fonts with all the complete syllables(अक्षरों), not with mere/limited characters (वर्ण) and glyphs(वर्णों के टुकड़ों या संयुक्ताक्षरों). The possible number of complete syllables in Hindi still could not be counted yet. It may go beyond Billions.\n\nFor example in Devanagari (Sanskrit) in the word\n\nकार्त्स्न्या\n\nका is one syllable  \nand  \nर्त्स्न्या is second syllable\n\nर्+त्+स्+न्+य+ा\n\nHere 10 number of Unicode characters combindingly makes one syllable (अक्षर).\n\nThere should not be any such thinking or arguments that \"this or that Conjunct/syllable is never used\". If one has to write name of all the persons all over the world in Devanaagarii, all combinations of C+C+C+C+C(n)...+V/M+VM should be taken in account in syllable designing. [C=consonant, V=Vowel, M=Maatraa, VM=Vowel Modifier].\n\nFor this in Devanaagari\n\nif Base Consonants = 34 Numbers  \nBase Vowels = 16  \nBase Maatraa = 16  \nVowel Modifiers = 3  \nNukta = 1\n\nThen at 1 level of consonant, total number of syllables may be 34+16=50\\*16=800\\*3=2400\n\nक का कि की कु कू..... को कौ  \nकं कां किं कीं कुं कूं..... कों कौं  \nकँ काँ किँ कीँ कुँ कूँ ..... कोँ कोँ  \nकः काः किः कीः कुः कूः... कोः कौः  \n....  \n....  \nह हा हि...  \nहः हाः हिः\n\nक्कि क्कु क्कौ, क्कौँ  \nस्मि र्क्रोँ... ल्क्य (याज्ञवल्क्य)\n\nAt 2 level of consonant conjuncts 2400\\*\\*2  \nAt 5 level of consonant conjuncts 2400\\*\\*5\n\nAt 10 level of consonant conjuncts 2400\\*\\*10 = 6.3403380965376e+33\n\nWhich comes to infinite, or we may say total number of syllables in Devanaagari (or in other Indic script may be as much as total number of stars in the sky or hairs in a human body)\n\nN.B. : Above calcutaion may be wrong, it should be taken just a mere example/glympsh.\n\n====\n\nSo the Indic users should\n\nEither make a Hindi OT font with all the syllables(अक्षर)\n\nor\n\nRemain satisfied by just using the glyphs (pieces of characters) only, forget further processing, searching, replacing, sorting and indexing.\n\nHariram\n\n"

What you might be able to do is to set individual blocks of text in such an app, export or print them to PDF, and then embed the PDFs in your InDesign app as graphics. This is what I do when I need to include text in InDesign documents using scripts or font formats that are not supported by Adobe.\n\nAnother option, if you don't mind updating your software and switching fonts, would be to install InDesign CS3 and use some OpenType Thai fonts. The Adobe Thai font family ships with Acrobat 7.0.5 and later (look in the Acrobat/Fonts folder) and is good for text.

We took some steps towards Thai support in InDesign, but we do not claim to have reached our minimal level of support (yet). The same is true for other scripts. For Thai, there is [InDesign Thai](http://web.archive.org/web/20120913054431/http:/www.indesignthai.com/board/) which I have heard of, but haven't evaluated.  \nAnyway, for Thai:  \n1) We do not use AAT or Uniscribe. In fact, we only do the correct positioning of marks using OpenType fonts that do the positioning themselves using 'mark' and 'mkmk' features. Microsoft's original Thai fonts had a table-based way of doing mark positioning using some PUA accent glyphs, but we don't support it. I think InDesign ME and InDesign Thai both support the Microsoft legacy fonts, but not AAT fonts. (not sure)  \n2) In CS3 we did not utilize any code to break Thai phrases correctly. The user would have to insert \"discretionary line break characters\" manually (U+200B: zero width breaking space). FYI, Thai doesn't use spaces between words, but still expects line-breaks to occur between words. There are free algorithmic approaches available which we are investigating.\n\nThe InDesign team believes that extending our script support is a good long-term business opportunity, but as pointed out above we have to implement a cross-platform solution and (more critically) we are unwilling to release something under the \"Adobe InDesign\" label unless it reaches a pretty high level of quality. And, of course these features compete for resources with every other wish-list...\n\n"

Plus there may be some manual tweaking required, which I would not be confident in doing not being a Thai speaker. I could always download a trial of CS3 to try it but it looks like the choice of font is key to the correct alignment of accents. Linotype was mentioned earlier - can I assume that any one of these should work?\n\nA silly question - but how do our Thai friends get around it? Is it that the whole system from hardware to operating system - is set up for it?\n\nWith thanks\n\n"

This would produce correct linebreaks but wouldn't treat every line as a separate paragraph.\n\n"
