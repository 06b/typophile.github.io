  "content": "Hello everyone...\n\nI have been trying to figure this one out on my own for a while, but I don't know nearly as much as those of you... perhaps you can help me ID this one, it's Hollister's main brand typeface, best seen on the bottles, bags, and boxes. Variations of it are used on the website.\n\nThank you in advance for looking. It's my first post to this board...\n\nDarrin\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130117002450im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1118_01_b_4599.jpg)\n\n",

The letterforms in Koehler are a little more crudely drawn (intentionally so) while the forms in Alternate Gothic are more regular. Koehler seems to have a little bit of contrast, but Alternate Gothic has none. The terminals of Koehler are cut at a greater angle than those of Alternate Gothic...\n\n- Lex\n\n"
