Common sans serif typefaces are [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica), [Verdana](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Verdana), [Optima](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Optima), [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura), [Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frutiger), and [Gill Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gill%20Sans). Sans serif forms originate in ancient Greek and Etruscan [chiseled inscriptions](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/chiseled%20inscriptions), a style later adopted by the Romans, but sans serif type was so novel upon its introduction in the [18th century](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/18th%20century) that it defied any attempts at categorization. It was eventually categorized as [Doric](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Doric), [Ionic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Ionic) or [grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/grotesque) type, and was in common use by the end of the century by industrial letterers. The most popular early sans serif typeface was cut by [Monotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Monotype) as [Doric](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Doric), but the most prominent sans serif type known to contemporary designers is the much-imitated [Akzidenz Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Akzidenz%20Grotesk), ancestor of [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) and [Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Univers), two of the most dominant type families of the second half of the [20th century](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/20th%20century).\n\nSans serif types underwent a flowering in the early 20th century, and started to divide into many other families. The first prominent step beyond the [grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/grotesque) industrial types was the development of the [geometric sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/geometric%20sans) faces promulgated by designers influenced by the [Bauhaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bauhaus). These faces are built, as the name suggests, on \"pure\" geometric structures, and self-consciously move beyond the modulated strokes and classical proportions mimicked by the grotesques (as well as the serif faces on which grotesques were modeled). [Jan Tschichold](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jan%20Tschichold), [Paul Renner](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%20Renner), [Rudolf Koch](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Rudolf%20Koch), and [Jakob Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jakob%20Erbar) all developed profoundly influential [geometric sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/geometric%20sans) types. [Paul Renner](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%20Renner)'s [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura), in particular, was an early example of a [type system](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/type%20system), and continues to be a very popular, coolly stylish [type family](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/type%20family) even today.\n\nThe next -- or concurrent -- development in sans serif types was the [humanist sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/humanist%20sans), as exemplified in [Eric Gill](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Eric%20Gill)'s [Gill Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gill%20Sans), which was in turn based on [Edward Johnston](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Edward%20Johnston)'s lettering for the [London Underground](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/London%20Underground). Humanist sans typefaces more directly mimic the forms and structures of [calligraphy](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/calligraphy), and generally have somewhat eccentric, more classical shapes. Humanist sans faces have more [modulated strokes](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/modulated%20strokes), and their [italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/italic)s are frequently more directly based on [cursive](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/cursive) writing. They have always been more popular, for whatever reason, in Europe than the United States.\n\n[Grotesques](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Grotesques) staged a huge comeback in the wake of World War II, with the development of [type systems](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/type%20systems) and [Swiss typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Swiss%20typography). [Max Miedinger](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Max%20Miedinger)'s [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) and [Adrian Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adrian%20Frutiger)'s [Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Univers) are the most successful examples of these types. The new grotesques were designed for a new typography, where type was set to a rationalized [grid system](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/grid%20system), and the \"characterless\" type was intended to transparently serve the text. The readability of [sans serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif) types as [text faces](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/text%20faces) is hotly debated, though, and [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) and [Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Univers) found their greatest fame as advertising and corporate communications faces. A strange side development during this period was [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf)'s more or less sui generis revival of Roman inscriptional forms with [Optima](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Optima), a stately sans serif that is frequently characterized as a [humanist sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/humanist%20sans), although it really belongs to no category but its own.\n\nSans serifs played an integral part in the explosion of [display faces](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/display%20faces) that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. The number of typefaces and styles is innumerable, but one of the most characteristic fonts of this period was [Herb Lubalin](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Herb%20Lubalin)'s [Avant Garde](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Avant%20Garde), a [ligature](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ligature)-heavy stylized [geometric sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/geometric%20sans) that was ubiquitous throughout the 1970s.\n\nThe last twenty years of the [20th Century](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/20th%20Century) saw an overwhelming increase in the number of sans serif faces, of all kinds and descriptions. The kickoff to this explosion was probably the introduction of [Adrian Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adrian%20Frutiger)'s eponymous type family [Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frutiger), a sort of master thesis on the possibilities of rationalism in type and the possibilities of the restrained use of humanist techniques in the construction of sans serif type. It has been much imitated and admired. Frutiger was not content with this, and later participated in the systemization of many of his type families, first revisiting the concept of the [geometric sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/geometric%20sans) with [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Avenir), and later revising both the [Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Univers) and [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Avenir) [type systems](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/type%20systems) with [Linotype Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype%20Univers) and [Avenir Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Avenir%20Next). At the same time, [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf) and [Akira Kobayashi](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Akira%20Kobayashi) revisted [Optima](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Optima), producing a new version called [Optima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Optima%20Nova) that brought the typeface into line with current fashion, adding a true italic, making the face more suitable for setting text, and adding a range of weights to the face. It is cleaner and more functional but not universally loved.\n\nMeanwhile, [Dutch type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Dutch%20type) designers, many of them studying under the influential theorist and teacher [Gerrit Noordzij](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gerrit%20Noordzij), were taking the [humanist sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/humanist%20sans) and making it their own. Building on the legacy of [Hans Eduard Meier](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hans%20Eduard%20Meier)'s ahead-of-its-time [Syntax](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Syntax), they created a new collection of typefaces that were essentially graceful, Renaissance serif faces minus the serifs. These new sans serif families were often part of ever-larger [type systems](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/type%20systems) that encompassed sans serif, serif, and other typefaces, culminating in efforts like [Lucas de Groot](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lucas%20de%20Groot)'s huge [Thesis](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Thesis) family. It can sometimes be hard to tell the players without a scorecard, but careful study of the Dutch humanist sans faces will reveal their considerable subtlety and sophistication.\n\nEnglish type designers have continued to work in the mold of [Eric Gill](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Eric%20Gill), whose types have had a near death-grip on the English imagination. [Gill Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gill%20Sans) is everywhere in England even today, and most English sans serif designs owe it a debt of inspiration. Probably one of the best interpretations of the \"English humanist sans\" is [Jeremy Tankard](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jeremy%20Tankard)'s [Bliss](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bliss) family, which does for [Gill Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gill%20Sans) what [TheSans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TheSans) does for [Syntax](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Syntax) -- cleans it up, systematizes and freshens it.\n\nBecause of their supposed neutrality, sans serif faces have continued to be massively popular for corporate identity and communications. This is the aspect that American designers have explored most thoroughly, with [Matthew Carter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Matthew%20Carter) leading the way with his commissioned work for [Microsoft](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Microsoft) showing what can be done with small type on low-resolution screens. His [Verdana](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Verdana) and [Tahoma](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Tahoma) families were designed for the screen and extensively [hinted](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/hinted); they sacrifice economy for readability, a sensible decision when scrolling is cheap but pixels are scarce. Pushing things in a different direction are [Hoefler & Frere-Jones](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hoefler%20%2526amp%3B%20Frere-Jones), who have recently produced both [Whitney](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Whitney) and [Gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gotham), faces designed explicitly for use in the corporate vernacular. [Gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gotham), in particular, is based on the [grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/grotesque) sans serif hand-lettering found in New York, and possesses some of the erratic energy found in that lettering. It was recently honored by being selected as the typeface used on the cornerstone for the September 11th Memorial at the World Trade Center.\n\nMany type enthusiasts are very tired of the profusely overabundant Helvetica and outraged by the ubiquitousness of Arial, a near-exact (but uglier) Helvetica clone commissioned by Microsoft for obscure reasons. Proclaiming Arial as your favorite font is likely to win you few friends on [Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typophile).\n\n\\* [Serif vs. Sans Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131007220725/http:/rosendorf.us/blogdorf/archive/2006/01/18/1456.aspx): A discussion on Blogdorf about serif vs. sans serif type.\n\n",
