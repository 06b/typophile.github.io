I'm designing a logo for an acupuncture clinic and the problem   \n I'm running into is this: I'm creating the logo in a size somewhere in the   \n neighborhood of 8000 X 5000 at 300dpi. From there I'm resizing downward   \n depending on the use. The problem I'm running into is setting the type. What   \n methods are there to set type that large? Are there typefaces available that   \n large? Or is the typical method to design your own type for that size of a project?   \n In my smaller rough drafts I was using Trajan as the typeface. I've attached a   \n web-ready rough draft. Thanks in advance!   \n{logo.gif}   \n\"   \n   \n--------   \n   \nPOST 2/4:   \nAlessandro Segalini   \n [http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view\\_profile&profile=as8-users](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052613/http:/www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&profile=as8-users)   \nTypophile Regular   \nUsername: as8   \nPost Number: 280   \nRegistered: 4-2004   \n\"   \nWhy do you set type in Photoshop?   \n Kern the dot after the P, now it is closer to S.   \n AS   \n\"   \n   \n--------   \n   \nPOST 3/4:   \nDavid Hubner   \n [http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view\\_profile&profile=formlos-users](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052613/http:/www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&profile=formlos-users)   \nUppercase   \nUsername: formlos   \nPost Number: 176   \nRegistered: 2-2002   \n\"   \nYou should use a vector program / software for creating logos ( or when working with type   \n ), something like Freehand, Illustrator or Corel Draw.. That way, your logo being a vector   \n file, is scaleable and there would be no problem with rezising it..   \n   \n [http://www.prepressure.com/image/bitmapvector.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052613/http:/www.prepressure.com/image/bitmapvector.htm)  \n [http://graphicssoft.about.com/library/weekly/aa000327a.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052613/http:/graphicssoft.about.com/library/weekly/aa000327a.htm)   \n\"   \n   \n--------   \n   \nPOST 4/4 (x2):   \nDaniel Genser   \n [http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view\\_profile&profile=daniel\\_genser-users](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052613/http:/www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&profile=daniel_genser-users)   \nRegistered   \nUsername: daniel\\_genser   \nPost Number: 2 (&3)   \nRegistered: 8-2004   \n\"   \n Thanks for the suggestions.

Also it looks like you have an effect on your type at least the CHEN'S, do your self a favor and loose the effect in large sizes. CHEN'S is very spaced out it looks like a mistake. Match the kerning of the rest of the words.\n\n"
