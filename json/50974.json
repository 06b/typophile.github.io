  "content": "'Tomate' has been released. It started in 2006 as a brush lettering exercise for a poster and was later used for the ReType identity. In 2008 its author decided to turn it into a super fat typeface suitable for packaging and mass consumption products. The possibilities of ultra heavy forms are explored in this alphabet; trying to solve the design problems that these sort of forms present. 'Tomate' shows influences from the beautiful 'Goudy Heavyface Italic' which is a design Espinoza admires.\n\n[http://www.re-type.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417092429/http:/www.re-type.com/ \"http://www.re-type.com/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417092429im_/http:/typophile.com/files/specimen-tomate-1_4799.gif)\n\n",
