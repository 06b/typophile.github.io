But after a layoff and with a lot of free time between freelance gigs, I'm hoping to get caught up and learn some interactive design.\n\nAny recommendations for good books on Flash, DW, or a combination of the two in application?\n\nOf course, any seasoned advice on learning web from scratch would be great, too.\n\n--Stubborn print designer.\n\n",

      "content": "Get a Lynda.com subscription. It’s much more efficient to alt-tab between the app and a video than to try and read through tutorial books. They also avoid problems with inaccuracies caused by text not being well-updated for new versions because it’s much easier for video editors to catch mistakes; if something the author is discussing doesn’t really work, it’s pretty obvious in a movie.\n\n"

I went through the latter, in order to get up to speed on AS 3.0, which is very different from the old 2.0.\n\nThe books are sometimes boring, but they have detailed step-by-step instructions that ensure that you learn all the basics of the program.\n\nI also second the Linda.com suggestion.\n\n"

      "content": "A useful web HTML/CSS book that I'd recommend is \"CSS Mastery\" by Andy Budd. It has very useful examples and does a good job of breaking things down. Granted this is not Dreamweaver or Flash related. But you really should learn the fundamentals before figuring out which tool to use...\n\nAnd learn ActionScript 3 if you're serious about Flash. It will be tough (it's like learning a new language, with grammar and all) but it's the way to go. The Flash help files can be useful in this regard, with code and examples that you can learn from.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

And with HTML5 on the horizon, by the time you get your chops who knows where Adobe will be in this space (still not on the iPhone I bet).\n\nIf I were you I'd go the Ajax route and get up to speed with JavaScript/jQuery & HTML/CSS. It's been gaining momentum since the new generation of browsers contain very fast JavaScript engines. It's also the \"open web\" so you can at least take some comfort in knowing it will be supported by the major browsers.\n\n"
