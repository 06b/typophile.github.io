The bar in A ought to be distinctly lower.   \n   \nThe E + P are the best letters thusfar.   \n   \nThe way you've snipped the corners from the S doesn't make sense with the rest of your font. It results in a distinctly backwards slant in relation to the other letters.   \n   \nThe K is so clunky, and it feels like a chank rip-off. Fix the join and (IMHO) lose the 90\n\n"
