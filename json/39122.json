  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI’m in the process of developing the identity for a environmentally friendly interior design company called eden. The owner is really fond of the idea of having a tree sprout from the ascender of the d and it’s roots from the counter space.\n\nSince the overall concept is pretty simple I thought a sans-serif font would be most appropriate for the company.\n\nI’ve been in search for the perfect font and I am in need of some assistance. Since the companies name is in all lowercase I was thinking of customizing avenir (35 light) or going with a font similar to helevetica neue.\n\nDo you all have any ideas of what may work?\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n [‹ TypeDesign: Tools & Books](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203171451/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39165 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The right font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203171451/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39051 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Roots and leaves are the new swoosh.\n\nAnyway, does the group tend to stick with any particular style of interior design? Because that could have a pretty big impact on what font to pick. And is this a firm that does homes, businesses, or both?\n\n"
