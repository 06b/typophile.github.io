Anyway... to make contrast between logo and type, between geometric(logo) and organic(logotype) I choused serif face.   \nI maybe totally wrong here but that�s why I'm here.   \n   \nIf someone can recommend a serif face that has double storey \"g\" glyph, the one which has open bottom counter (for the lack of my knowledge in typographic terminology I included an example (bottom picture)).   \nAs I said so already, I'm open for any suggestions.   \n   \nthanks and sorry for my bad english.\n\n",

News Gothic Condensed, Trade Gothic Condensed (its squarer than News Gothic), Formata light Condensed, Optima, Agenda Light Condensed. You can find these faces at MyFonts to take a look. If you want something more unusual, take a look at Dyna Grotesk D Plain, Faber Eins/Zwei Normal, Pragma ND Light.\n\n"

      "content": "Luka, I think your mark is pretty well done. I'd be interested to see how the top of the logo \"g\" would look if it were closed, like the speaking bubble in your first post.   \n   \nI'm having trouble seeing the reason for the red box. The \"g\" is a bit unbalanced inside of it and I don't know if it belongs. What do you think about eliminating the box and increasing the size of the \"g\" stroke?   \n   \nOf course, losing the box would make it much harder to incorporate the theatre name. Hm. One more thing�contrary to your thoughts, I don't really jive with the condensed type. Oh well. Perhaps I will get my eyes checked.   \n   \nKeep up the good work!\n\n"

      "content": "The openness of the g seems to match the logo best in Optima, and optima looks like one of the easier ones to read at the smaller size, but it has the most contrast.   \n   \nI like the curved l's in agenda, but I'm wondering if straight l's �parallel� the idea of the box better? With the g matching well though, it's a tough one to pass up!   \n   \nThe bolder sans in the center column at the bottom (trade?) is looking pretty nice. I think the l's are being set too closely though (not sure how final, sorry). The spacing you have in optima seems to be more correct.   \n   \nNone of those though have the exact g that you were looking for, with the lower bowl open. (But if you really like any of the ones you're working with, that's something you could make yourself.)   \n   \nHowever, John Sans, (although it isn't monoweight), has less contrast than optima, has an open-bowl g, and even has the organic ear on the g.\n\n"

      "content": "once again, thanks all for responses   \n   \n@Daniel Madden   \nWithout the red box there is danger of interpretation as \"ggavella\" (two g's in the row)   \nso its function is to differentiate the logo from type.   \nAs you said it yourself, than it's much harder to   \nincorporate theatre name.   \nThere will be lots of printed material which format is much wider than taller so there wouldn't be enough space for logo if type goes beneath it.   \n   \n   \n@Brian   \n   \nI agree that optima is much better option, but I'm   \nbiased with this font, big part of market for cosmetic products has optima on its label.\n\n"

I'm thinking that if there was a monoweight version of John sans, that would be perfect, or just to alter the g from either trade or news gothic.\n\n"

Not so much the type, though it isn't bad, but the way you showcased the development of the symbol.   \n   \nIf I were you, I would consider using all three elements in their logo. Without them, I just don't make the connection of the talk bubble.
