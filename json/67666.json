The rest of the website has alot to offer as well, but here it is:\n\n[http://www.thedieline.com/blog/features-top-packaging-advice/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020153355/http:/www.thedieline.com/blog/features-top-packaging-advice/ \"http://www.thedieline.com/blog/features-top-packaging-advice/\")\n\nI decided to post this here after reading:\n\n`Other characteristics that failed identities share:`\n\nGlobal logos that do not consider global interpretations  \nLogos that need an “explanation”  \nOverly “trendy” logos  \nLogos that require complicated production techniques  \nLogos that require in-depth training in which to educate users  \nLogos with multiple taglines or messages that are not always in sync\n\nand thinking of how those are some very good guidelines for logos..\n\nanyway, back to the all-nighter project.\n\nenjoy\n\n",
