Victoria Beckham kind of skirts the line, but I guess it can be justified by the fact that the crossbar-less A at the the end of \"VICTORIA\" acts as an inversion of the initial V and sort of book-ends the name, creating a natural break with \"BECKHAM\". But perhaps I'm stretching.\n\nAs always, it depends on the particular execution and whether it's done well or badly.\n\n"

Perhaps \"ad Astra\" the face of the future.  \nIn any case, the crossbarless \\_A\\_ is now such a design cliché that I would be reluctant to use it for anything that does not have an ultra sleek, high tech or futuristc character.
