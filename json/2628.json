(book deal: Hrant, you should write a book on some of this stuff.) I call this process of creating letterforms the Lineto/fusion method. Everybody I'm sure has seen the great stuff at lineto.com. I think every gridchild has messed around with Digital variations. Miles Newlyn has a pretty good one.   \n   \nYou're posting this for criticism...so some of the letters -- b, k, m, v, x -- well they seem too dark. But unless you stray from the beginning forms, what can you do?   \n   \nthe 'b' could be light like the 'd'   \n   \nthe k and the x, wow, those are difficult using the forms.   \n   \nI understand your context point, but maybe there's another solution to some of those darker letters to make it the forms more legible.   \n   \nbj\n\n"
