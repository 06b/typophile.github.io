For example, search for “ven diagram” and you get 18,000 results. Then if you search the correct spelling, “Venn diagram” you get 558,000 results. I’m sure it’s not 100% reliable, but it’s good when you don’t have a clue.\n\nIt’s like polling the audience in Who Wants to be a Millionaire. =P\n\n“thou shalt not” yields 1.2 million results  \n“thall shalt not” yields 558 results\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLest anyone think I’m an AIGA basher (nay, I’m a paying member, else why would I receive their mailings) I should say that the AIGA deserves a lot of credit.

Seriously, who doesn’t enjoy pointing out someone else’s mistakes? :)\n\nTo put my own shameful moment into the ring:  \nOn a big marketing kit project, I once misspelled part of the client’s name on the kit label.
