Rick, look at 2 letter together, with your fingers covering the others. then look at 3 together, then 4, etc... it's not mathematical, just perceptual. the kerning needs just a little help in LANDMARK, and even more help in HEALTHCARE.   \n   \nbut what bothers me is the thin part on the R in LANDMARK...unless you made more thin parts on other letters...maybe.   \n   \nwhy the triangular icon?\n\n"

Is \"connecting health and performance\" part of this logo unit, or is it a separate element that will be used liberally on varying applications? If it is separate I have no issue, but if it is part of the unit I think it needs to feel like it is. Right now, it is too distant and lonely.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

The pyramid is to represent, in its most literal sense, a landmark.
