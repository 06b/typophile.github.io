  "content": "I'm tying to make a small script with robafab far a multiple master Font.  \nBasically my script will move a component inside a diacritic glyph.\n\nFor intance moving the \"acute\" accent inside \"oacute\".  \nThis is the script:  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nfrom robofab.world import CurrentFont  \nf = CurrentFont()\n\ng = f[\"oacute\"]  \ng.components[1].move((-100,-100))  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe problem is:  \nSince my font is a multiple master with two weight masters, when I run this script, it moves the accent in the both masters.\n\nIs there any way to move the accent only in one of the masters?\n\nThanks in advanced.\n\n",

      "content": "As far as I know, RoboFab is not able to deal with individual instances in a multiple master file. You might be able to achieve your goal by using FontLab’s native Python implementation instead.\n\nOtherwise, why not use anchors for placing accents? If done correctly it will save you the hassle of dealing with individual accented glyphs.\n\n-Paul van der Laan  \n [www.type-invaders.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809070157/http:/www.type-invaders.com/ \"www.type-invaders.com\")\n\n"
