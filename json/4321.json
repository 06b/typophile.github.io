I thought it looked very familiar, but I can't place it. I've searched T-26, Alias, Device, Psy/Ops and books where I thought it might be shown, without any luck.   \n   \nAnyone have any ideas?   \n ![salsatribe sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124619im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33652.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks Ignacio. I knew Amoeba had some similar qualities, but the font she sent is made up of ellipses, and I seem to remember reading a font description that mentioned this design feature. If she wants to expand the branding, I doubt that a more random-looking font will be what she wants. The a/e filp occurs in many designs I've seen (that would be a good list to make), but here I think the ellipses in most letter forms is the key to this ID.\n\n"
