  "content": "Hello everyone. I am currently looking into the possibility of supplying a client with H&FJ’s lovely new Archer. However, before committing her cash, she (and I for that matter) would like to see a printed sample. Do any of you know where in London I might be able to pick up a copy of “Martha Stewart Living”, which uses Archer extensively? I will also see if H&FJ can do a brief mock-up PDF.\n\nThanks for any help,\n\nDominic\n\n [‹ Book Design - Margins](http://web.archive.org/web/20080324121524/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43115 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [how to auto number ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080324121524/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43275 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Their advertisements tend to show the featured design in a lot of different settings (mostly low-contrast, soft colors), and fill a whole magazine page. Recently ads have appeared featuring Archer exclusively. This might be enough information for your client.\n\n"
