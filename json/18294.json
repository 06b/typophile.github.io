Here are some things I’ve done to help me adjust:\n\nIn the system preferences \\> appearance change the scroll arrows to appear at both ends of a scroll bar.\n\nI’m always accidently clicking too far to the left or right of a window and losing focus of the application. In photoshop, always hit F to go to full screen mode. Also, try to minimize the windows you’re not using.\n\nControl = Alt. It hurts at first, like learning a new guitar chord. I still get cramps in my left thumb from reaching it all the way under my palm to press that weird open-apple key.\n\nFont Explorer X has helped a lot with font management. Definately use it.\n\nI still don’t understand the mac file structure. I keep all my work on the desktop in job folders. The finder window is pretty neat though. I primarily use the column view, it’s the fastest and easiest. Kind of like the old 2 column windows explorer but a but more clumsy.\n\nNow I just wish I could figure out how to get rid of these stupid jelly buttons, rounded corners, and brushed aluminum.\n\n"

      "content": "I’ve been using Apple for about two years now. The most terrifying thing about Mac OS X is that when you copy a folder over an existing one, OS X completely replaces the destination folder (removing the old contents) rather than merging the contents, which is what Windows does. I still use my PC to access my Mac hard drive and do file management there (batch renaming, synchronizing various folders, moving stuff around), since it’s much faster than using the Finder.\n\nAlso, there is one thing that I still haven’t figured out: with one Finder window open in a particular folder, how do I easily open a second Finder window in the same folder/path? (So I can go to a subfolder from there and conveniently — as much as it’s possible in Finder — copy/move stuff around)?\n\nA.\n\n"

And don’t worry about asking the people you are working with for advice and help. You will find that the dock, and the GUI (graphical user interface) is much friendlier than the PC and, in general, the Mac is much easier to use. But, like everything else in life, you can make mistakes. But have fun while you’re working.\n\n"

Now that I do, here is one way to do the shortcut Adam is looking for:\n\nWith a Finder window open, double-click a folder in it while holding the command key. A new window (the folder) will open. Hold down the command key and click on the title of the new window. A pop-up menu showing the folder path will appear. Choose the enclosing folder (or volume). You now have two windows to the same file path. The only case when this wouldn’t work is when there are no folders in the window view you want to duplicate. There is probably a way to do this with AppleScript in a way that works regardless.\n\nFYI, before OS X, it was not possible to have two windows showing the same path. This is a Next carry-over that confused long-time Mac users at first.\n\nControl-click is the same as a right-click—handy if your mouse only has one button.\n\n"
