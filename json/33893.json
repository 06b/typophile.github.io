Can you send to me gdf data structures? I have read documentations at links following:  \n [http://www.ertico.com/en/links/links/gdf\\_-\\_geographic\\_data\\_files.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092107/http:/www.ertico.com/en/links/links/gdf_-_geographic_data_files.htm \"http://www.ertico.com/en/links/links/gdf\\_-\\_geographic\\_data\\_files.htm\")  \n [http://www.4d-technologies.com/writegdf/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092107/http:/www.4d-technologies.com/writegdf/ \"http://www.4d-technologies.com/writegdf/\")  \nBut these documentations are difficult to me writing a tool to convert from shp file to gdf file. Have you got this tool or source code to gdf read and write? If this is a licence, how can I buy it?\n\nBest regards\n\n [‹ Quark Problems / OT-fonts.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092107/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33707 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Style-Linking Question from a Newbie ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092107/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33757 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
