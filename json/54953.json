Your critique would be appreciated. Just wanna get your thoughts before I move ahead.

      "content": "I love the font and the dark green colour you use on some of the first options. So I think definetely on the way. Quite like the first option with the circles...could you just loose the icon all together? Just think the icon is a bit too fussy and it needs more simplicity. The second options are good too but the different colours almost look a bit child focussed so maybe something abit crisper? Perhaps less wavy almost?\n\n"

Not my most favorite combo.\n\nI did play with the type and kerned and tweaked the hell out of it. But I don’t know how interesting it would be without the visual elements in both the options.\n\nThe idea for the circles comes from mathematical theories (but that is way to technical and off base with what the company does). So I refined it to be a simpler and more visual appealing.\n\nThe test tube idea came from reading some of the copy (i.e. business plans/elevator pitch) and even though there isn’t a lab. The words “experiment” “mix” “blend” were words reoccurring in the copy.\n\n"
