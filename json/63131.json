  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nLooking for some suggestions for design for a logo for an indian clothing store.  \nThe store sells traditional indian fabrics, both stiched and unstitched, many prints, clothing with extensive hand embroidery, and bead work,fancy bridal pieces that are custom stitched, custom crystal jewelery (fused between western and traditional indian designs). The store it self is currently under construction and will boast a boutique look, with wood floors, custom fixtures etc. The owners would like to use bits and pieces of color from the logo to compliment the interior.\n\ntarget: Indian decent women (18-40) who have minimal desire to travel abroad to shop for special events/ weddings.\n\nThe logo will be used in full color, and needs to read well from the signage. approx 6x 12 feet.\n\nany creative direction would help. type, color, logo ideas etc....\n\nThanks in advance guys!\n\nZed.\n\n",

Seems a bit lazy to provide a brief and ask everyone for input without first lifting a pencil of your own. Bring design concepts along with colors and typefaces options to the table and I'm sure you'll get some constructive feedback.\n\nI look forward to seeing what YOU come up with.\n\n"
