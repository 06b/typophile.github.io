I practically forgot my own birthday this year, as we’ve got our new little one in the family.\n\nIf anyone’s wondering “Who the heck is Chris?” I should be in Buffalo this year for TypeCon (had to miss last year). Perhaps I’ll print myself a t-shirt with my avatar on it, as I’m a little gun-shy at conventions. Always happy to meet the folks ’behind the Georgia’ here on Typophile.\n\nAnd this year, I’ll try to be _punkt_ual.\n\n::har har::\n\n(That was for you, Chris L.)\n\n"
