An [en dash](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101064313/http:/typophile.com/wiki/en%20dash) is a dash the width of the given en. Because \"em\" and \"en\" sound so much alike, the en is often referred to as the \"nut,\" from which the term [nut fractions](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101064313/http:/typophile.com/wiki/nut%20fractions) is derived.\n\n",
