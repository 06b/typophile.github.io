  "content": "I am thinking of using 1 Cor 13:13 (\"And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\") in the original Greek for an engraving on wedding rings. Here is an initial attempt:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416234920im_/http:/typophile.com/files/motto1_6374.png)\n  \nMy questions are:  \n- The font is GFS Neohellenic. It seems to me that a serif font would be less legible at such a tiny size as a wedding ring requires. Do you have any other suggestions?  \n- Apparently, there is no kerning in GFS Neohellenic. I think I should add negative kerning for the |ΓΑ|, |ΑΥ|, and |ΟΥ| pairs. How big should the kerning be? Are any other pairs jarring?  \n- Is the word spacing in the first line not too loose?  \n- Is the leading good?  \n- Is there anything else that could be improved?  \nThanks! \n",
