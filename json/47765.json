  "content": "When I think about type in a global sense, there are many things that come to mind..  \nSeeing that so many different cultures write in different ways, it’s easy for people judge others just by the particular type they use when communicating. For instance, especially in today’s world, when one sees someone writing in Arabic they are automatically jarred and become overwhelmed with a sense of doubt. However, the shoe could also be worn on the other foot if people who wright in Arabic see someone writing in English. Some people see beauty in other styles of writing, others consider it a flag of aggressive behavior. The different types and fonts used by people all over the world can either amaze the the intelligent or intimidate the simple minded.\n\n",
