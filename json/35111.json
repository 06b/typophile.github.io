  "content": "What font management program do you guys use?\n\nI love the Linotype FontExplorer, and I'm wondering if you can save the \"playlist\" like collections. I think you can save and load a \"configuration,\" but I can't get it to work.\n\nI want to organize a collection of fonts by genre, and load the configurations onto two other machine that share the same font library.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",
