And it is about legibility; oftentimes the only way to distinguish between 0 and O is through the context of seeing them in use with other glyphs from the same set--this can't be good practice.   \n   \nMaybe you should draft a manifesto to the effect that designers (who, ultimately, have the power to change or re-adopt such conventions) reclaim the slash-zero. I'd sign it (although, admittedly, a big reason why is because I really dig the art of the manifesto; I don't think it's done nearly enough nowadays).\n\n"

So maybe a nestled dot is better.   \n   \nBut then there's something else: this is a \"deliberative\" issue, meaning that when there's potential confusion the reader has all the time he needs to figure out if it's an Oh or a Zero. So if you diverge the glyphs in more subtle ways (like through height, width, or squareness) you can really solve the problem 95%, without \"brutality\".   \n   \nA serious problem however is an old-style Zero that's too much like a lc oh. The usual solution -making it a \"perfect\" circle- is just pukey to me. So reversing the stroke contrast (which makes sense in the context of the numerals in general), or giving it weight only on one side, and/or using hybrid nums (taller than x-height) is better, I think.   \n   \n\\> Georgia?   \n   \nBut the _original_ Georgia nums (hybrids), not the later -tamed- ones.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Perhaps a dot in the center of the zero is what we need.   \n   \n\"you can really solve the problem 95%, without \"brutality\".\"   \n   \nWell, the problem really only manifests itself when you're mixing letters of various cases with numerals. The common places this happens is in URLS (0sil8.org), Password/logins (Hol107L), software serial numbers, and programming languages. So, the problem is primarily online, where the subtle ways may simply not work.   \n   \nThe slash-zero was designed specifically for computer use (I think...) and I find it odd that it dissappeared while computer use was actually increasing.   \n   \nOf course, there's also the l/1 issue, but we'll save that for another day...\n\n"
