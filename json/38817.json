Maybe someone with good Hebrew can enlighten us.\n\n\\>“In the beginning was the Word” - if one takes that literally, which font would have been used?\n\nI take it you mean what script, as printing hadn’t been invented. The Mishnah (about 200 BCE-200) says that a bunch of miraculous stuff in Genesis was created in the twilight of the 6th day, just before creation was finished. This includes script, letters, the stylus, and the actual writing on the tablets of the Ten Commandments—which awaited discovery by Moses many centuries later. The writing on the stone would have been in either Aramaic (language of Abraham) or some Egyptian dialect, as they may not have understood Hebrew, which developed from the language of Canaan. Of course this account would not be accepted by Christians, but that’s as close as you’re going to get to an answer to “In the beginning was the Word”. Of course that’s Christian phrase—actually originally Stoic, but by this point you’ve lost interest :)\n\n"

      "content": "Bill: _“In the beginning was the Word”. Of course that’s Christian phrase—actually originally Stoic..._\n\nThe original Greek is Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, and although ’word’ is the traditional English translation of λόγος in some respects it isn’t a very good translation. Aristotle and other classical authors use λόγος to mean ’sentence’.\n\nIn the beginning of John’s gospel, λόγος very obviously refers to the second person of the Holy Trinity, i.e. to Christ. You only have to read the rest of the sentence and the following sentences for this to be perfectly obvious. Λόγος is a kind of title and a way of saying that the Son comes from the Father as the word/sentence comes from the mouth of the speaker, i.e. that the two are as inseparable as speaker and utterance.\n\nThe particular formulation Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος is Christian, leaning on Greek terminology from Hellenistic philosophy but, more importantly, consciously referencing passages in the Jewish scriptures e.g. Genesis 15 and 1 Samuel 3, that refer to ’the word of the Lord’ in ways that indicate a distinct person.\n\nJames: _I always took that at its word, that the concept of God etc. did not exist until language evolved._\n\nHow is that ’taking that at its word’? What about the rest of the sentence? What about the following sentence? The phrase occurs in the midst of a huge book that begins with the premise that all things were created by God, which is a pretty good clue that this phrase is not a comment on the the linguistic basis of an abstract concept of God. What the beginning of John’s gospel is saying is that both the Father and the Son were present ’in the beginning’: Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος.\n\nNote, by the way, that Greek verb used here is in a conjugation — imperfect active indicative — that has no direct parallel in English. The traditional ’In the beginning was the Word’ isn’t a very satisfactory translation, because it doesn’t capture the sense of that conjugation. A more accurate, if less rhetorically dramatic, rendering would be ’In the beginning the Word was being’. The imperfect active indicative conjugation indicates an action in the past ’in progress’ as it were, i.e. at the creation the Word already existed. The Greek makes explicit the Christian belief that the Son precedes creation, is himself uncreated and, as the rest of the sentence makes plain, is consubstantial with the Father.\n\n"

I am often amused at sacred works that encode multiple meanings into a text. As you might have suspected I was aware of the general gist of the Bible. What I find a bit of delight in is that if we proceeded from a premise that there was no diety directing affairs we could find this verse, the preceding verse, and the one that follows to be essentially true. I believe the “God is light” verse carries some of the same nuances.\n\n"

      "content": "John, on “logos” as alluding also to Stoic and other Greek ideas, that is what St. Augustine held, as have many other Christians following him, and I think it is likely—though not that the Greeks were proto-Christians, as many medieval Christians held. I read that in the 20th century people have tried to find ancient Hebraic sources, such as you mention, as referring to concepts similar to the Greek ’logos’ but frankly that is forced, and not credible for things that were written down before the Greek conquest of Judea (332 BCE, IIRC).\n\nIn the passages you refer to, the Hebrew of ’word of the Lord’ (devar YHVH) in itself does not imply any “distinct person”, as you seem to think. ’Devar’ has many meanings in Hebrew, including ’thing’ and ’declaration’ or ’utterance’, as well as ’word’. For example, the “Ten Commandments” are called in Hebrew, in the Torah, “aseret devarim”, the ten “words”, meaning ten statements or utterances.\n\n“Devar YHVH” is an extremely common phrase in the Hebrew Bible, occurring 270 times. (I just did a search—aren’t computers wonderful!) It is regularly used to refer to any message from God to a prophet. You can of course read it as some secret code intended by God to refer to Jesus, unknown to the writers who wrote it down or readers until the time of Jesus. But it’s by no means the plain meaning of the text.\n\nYou should be aware that it is irritating for Jews to be told by Christians who do not know Hebrew what the Hebrew really says, when there is a continuous 3000 year history of interpretation by people who could read the text in the original. Unfortunately many of the polemical Christian readings of the Hebrew Bible are downright dishonest. If you are interested in the literature debunking these tendentious interpretations, by people who know the Hebrew text very well, you can see, for example, the work of [Tovia Singer](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063416/https:/www.outreachjudaism.org/OrderForm.aspx?selected=study), a current Orthodox Rabbi who has specialized in unmasking these fraudulent polemics. I find this guy amusing as he sounds just like the comedian Jackie Mason—he has tapes, but I’m sure the book will do. You should know that many Christian scholars who do indeed know the Hebrew text do not find this stuff credible either.\n\n"

When Abraham arrived in Jerusalem it was already a well-established city with a powerful king - it was called Ur-Salam (city of peace- but I am sure John will find a better translation from some forgotten tongue), hence the Hebrew Ur-Shalom.
