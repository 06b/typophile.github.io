The answer is pretty simple - because Tahoma is Windows 'User Interface' font and had to support all the languages Windows XP was localized into except Chinese, Japanese and Korean which use their own UI fonts.   \n   \nSi\n\n"

The Thai government was about to switch entirely to Linux and MS came in and undercut Linux (which is pretty hard to do ;o)   \n   \nNot sure what Thailand eventually settled on, but perhaps this was part of the bribe.\n\n"
