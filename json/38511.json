I had a Grade 4 teacher who blew a gasket every time she saw “Toronto Maple Leafs” —- should be Leaves, she’d scream. Proves that in hockey at least you do have to know how to spell in order to win.\n\nThe Rockies logo looks like something on a bottle of mineral water.\n\n"

One suggested the team was from Grand Rapids, Colorado (is that a place?) while the other wondered if the full name was “Grand Rockies.”\n\nI was wholly amused. Sure, I really want to fix the wonky bowls of the Red Sox B, but, in my opinion, it’s not nearly as lazy as either of the Rockies logos.\n\nWow, YES, the BOSTON needs kerning, and RED looks like it’s bouncing along inside a stage coach wheel.\n\nGiven the expansive sports branding empire, how do these logos end up so glaringly imperfect?\n\n"

Red Sox fans may value traditional iconography far above legibility or other similar considerations.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I don’t think it’s really possible to “fix” anything.\n\n"
