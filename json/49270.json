I will let the images do the talking for itself.\n\nMore info here: [http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195 \"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0195_00_4694.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0195_02_5858.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0195_06_4683.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0195_08_3521.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0195_09_6210.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I provide a brief description of some of the thinking behind Augustus, special for the typophile crew. A small piece of trivia: Stephen Coles suggested the name Augustus Gloop when I first showed a display sheet here on typophile over five years ago. Thanks Stephen.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AugustusDisplaysheet_5028.jpg)\n\n**Five years is a maddening amount of time to spend developing a single-weight typeface. Still, I'm pleased that [Augustus](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195), my first commercially released font, is now available through [YouWorkForThem](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195).**\n\nThanks to the encouragement and eye of one Michael Cina, Augustus is now a complete international character set with a gang of whipped alternates. A half decade ago, however, it was 26 uppercase letters designed for a one-off poster. After hundreds of rounds of refinement, the rationalist that lives deep inside surfaced, and I developed a less flamboyant form for broader applications. It should be noted that this is no story of compromise. In the years since I began Augustus, the OpenType font format took hold, which enabled me to retain the original swash characters as stylistic alternates.\n\n**A modern classic.**  \nAugustus is a hefty sans serif that combines classical humanist elements and precise geometry. With racehorses and typography, lineage is everything, and Augustus is from good stock. I’ve paired the charisma of Morris Fuller Benton’s Eagle Bold with the flair of Zuzana Licko’s Dogma. The trained eye will detect a sprinkling of 19th century wood type in there as well.\n\nI named Augustus after Augustus Gloop, that alarming glutton of a child infamously expelled from the Chocolate Factory.\n\n**[Download Augustus Now](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060031/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0195)**\n\n"
