I like how the italic angle matches the paper angle.   \n   \nMy only complaint is the spacing: a bit uneven, and a bit loose for the \"Starke\".   \n   \nAlso, I would lower the ascender of the \"k\" to match the height of the \"S\".   \nAnd I might use a non-descending \"f\" in the claim.   \n   \n\\> The corners of paper will be adjusted to   \n\\> the type-corners in the final version.   \n   \nDo you mean they're going to be less sharp? Yes, that's needed (even of its own).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I would change first the colors. I would make the name red   \nand the paper blue. I would go further and I would try a red/blue scheme for   \nthe paper itself. Blue in the name conveys a somehow negative feeling. It is   \nnot the happiest of colors especially so full-bodied.   \n   \nThe last modification I made would be to try to link the symbol with the   \nname a little tighter (make it come underneath the name and go top right or   \nsomething). I would also make it a little more stylized and a little more   \ndynamic. I don't think the twists and curves really help (they may create   \nthe \"toilet paper\" effect ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022213210im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif). Try as little as necessary to make it clear is   \na sheet of paper and a really fast one and that should do it in my opinion.   \n   \nBogdan\n\n"
