Unfortunately KCRW only stream on the net using RealPlayer which is by far the worst of all the players. It invariably freezes my system within ten minutes of the start of a stream.   \n   \nI'd listen to more classical if there were any decent net stations out there, but I haven't found anything yet that I like anough to regularly return to. BBC Radio 3 is very good, but isn't always playing music - plus it, too, only streams RealPlayer.\n\n"

However, the CARP's recommended royalty rates are currently more than 200% of most Webcasters' gross revenues!   \n>    \n> If Copyright Office accepts the CARP's recommendation, most observers believe that the decision will effectively kill Internet radio, as the retroactively-owed fees would bankrupt all but the very largest Internet-only webcasters (and would probably trigger the shutdown of most broadcast stations' Web simulcasts, including almost all the educational and community stations ).   \n>    \n> Read more background here or in an editorial from the San Jose Mercury News.\n> \n> * * *\n> !-/quote-!\\>!-quote-!\\>   \n   \nFrom what I can gather this is regarding US legislation only, however non-US listeners to US stations will certainly be affected. \n"
