This makes it easier for our type IDers to keep track of the different threads.  \n**Two** | Your sample has been identified. Your thread gets tagged and we include the name of the typeface(s) you were looking for and the name(s) of the person(s) who IDed it/them for you. That way we don't need to needlessly open threads to check if there's still need for our services.\n\nSee reason 1. ;^)\n\n"
