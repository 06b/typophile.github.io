My searches for the term \"Pickworth\" online and in my few reference books turns up nothing identical except the Red Rooster digital font. I know of a fair number of similar fonts, such as Post -- digitized in a slick version by Nick Curtis as Saturday Morning Toast [https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095432/https:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/ \"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/\") but I am trying track down this particular design.  \nI would welcome any suggestions as to the old time font name and its source.\n\nThanks.  \nDon\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [PickworthOSRR.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095432/http:/typophile.com/files/PickworthOSRR.jpg) | 115.49 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Many thanks Kevin for the \"Antique No 14\" reference. Dan X. Solo often used names for the fonts he purchased that differed from the original name, but I suspect that this one could perhaps be unchanged from the original. It gives me something I can use while going through old source names. Sounds like the type of font name that would have been used by a foundry like Central, Bruce or Conner  \nAlso thanks for the reference to the polished version by Nick Curtis. Some differences in the letter-forms due to editing but obviously based on the same font.  \nThe Peter Dako digital font of 1991 identifies it as \"Hunt SpeedBall.\" This seems to suggest a source in one of the Hunt lettering books.  \nSpeculating: Hunt lettering based on an old foundry font called \"Antique No 14\" ??? Or no old foundry, just the Hunt lettering??? Should find a Hunt book and see if it is there and if so whether he calls it \"Speedball\" or \"Antique No 14\" ....  \nThe Steffmann digital font of 2000 is a clone ripped from the Dako font. I standardized the sizing and found the pattern of points in the outlines are the same, allowing for errors resulting from conversions back and forth; including the sequence of lines and curves in the digital outlines.  \nThe quest continues  \nDon\n\n"

I see similarities in where the bumps occur, but I also see differences.  \nThis is another lead to follow to the source of this design, perhaps in Germany. Bauer, S&G etc. In any case, this confirms that the design is pre-1931.  \nDon\n\n"
