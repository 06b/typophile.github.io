The roots of contemporary H&J systems go back to the work done by Zapf and others in the 1970s and 1980s, which were designed with text scaling in mind. Most fonts can handle 2–3 percent with no noticeable distortion. Some typefaces can handle more; Vialog was designed to distort 5% before it begins to show. Unfortunately many designers never use glyph scaling because they don’t read beyond the most basic books on typography which usually insist that scaling type is always criminal.\n\n"

There are many combinations. (I once have set up a short text, in which I changed the letter spacing from line to line.

And your typefaces are probably never printed in exactly the same way, as they look in your font editor. Good is, what works. If I draw an image and make a mistake – squirting ink unintentionally for example – I always check, whether the image looks better with the mistake instead of trashing it at once.

The space separating words remained constant.\" And again, \"…the narrower or wider alternate characters were skillfully deployed to yield lines of identical optical width…\" (Kapr \\*) These are faulty conclusions. Either the wider or the narrower characters are alternates. As the textual use of the wider characters out-number the narrower ones by approximately 3 to 1, the latter must be considered the alternates. What usually makes these alternates narrower is the fact that they lack serifs on the left side. They are never used or omitted to shorten or lengthen the space required by a given number of characters within a line. Gutenberg had employed them in both his earlier founts, the Sibyllenbuch and the Donatus/Kalender, but none of the extant printed specimens used justified lines. Their inception and use is purely aesthetic. They do not represent consciously narrowed letterforms. These alternates were cut and cast to create tighter fitting of certain character combinations that produced too much white-space within words. The alternates (left side sans-serifs) always follow C, E, F, X, Y, c, e, f, g, r, t, x, and y.\n\nFor the full text:  \n [http://www.daleguild.com/B-42\\_Story\\_01.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102071708/http:/www.daleguild.com/B-42_Story_01.html \"http://www.daleguild.com/B-42\\_Story\\_01.html\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102071708im_/http:/typophile.com/files/potb3_big_4965.gif)\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nPersonal Art and Design Portal of Ivan Gulkov  \n [www.ivangdesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102071708/http:/www.ivangdesign.com/ \"www.ivangdesign.com\")\n"

Nobody here said, that there should be established a general rule, that scaling is a good thing. James Puckett already wrote in the beginning, that _most_ fonts can handle 2–3 percent with no noticeable distortion. I don’t know, how many are _most_, but for sure _most_ is not the same as _all_.

I never have tested scaling body text with 2–3 percent, neither globally nor with the Indesign algorithm.\n\nBut perhaps it is easier, if I illustrate the logic of your sentence in another way: Imagine two men.

I agree that Gutenberg's multiple glyphs enabled his texts to look more natural, but I do believe that the number of alternate glyphs and ligatures were also created so he could achieve a strict justified column with even word spacing. As pointed out [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102071708/http:/www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/invention/familiar/), the strict justified columns are one of the ways scholars distinguish Johann's work from manuscripts. So, it appears that the even columns and spacing in his work were not part part of his goal of imitating the scribes.\n\nFrom the above link:<cite><br>\nOne way to distinguish between Gutenberg's printed Bible and a manuscript Bible is that in the printed book, all lines of text are brought to equal length in the column, forming justified lines. The strictly justified lines of Gutenberg's Bible were considered by some to be superior to the slightly uneven lines of a manuscript Bible.<br>\n</cite>\n\nPersonally, I'm against scaling glyphs _and_ spaces. I was taught by a thoughtful typographer that doing so was to butcher the balance and detail put into the font by the type designer. (Not to mention the readability issues). But practically speaking, I'd wager most typographers, book designers publication designers and graphic designers in general don't have the skill (Or the time. As you pointed out, it's much more work) to scale type at the type design level.\n\n"

I did not test it. But maybe I am coming to the same result.\n\nI think, there is one thing, that you forget, when you talk about well-crafted fonts. The very most body text fonts don’t have optical styles. And almost nobody of you typedesigners tell the potential customers on your websites, under which printing circumstances and in which point sizes your fonts should be used.\n\nTypetogether writes about Athelas: \"Athelas also takes advantage of the great advances and technical developments made in offset printing.\" Nevertheless **[the letterpress print of Athelas](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102071708/http:/www.type-together.com/index.php?action=portal/viewContent&cntId_content=2682&id_section=146)** seems to work. And it really looks dark in the letterpress print (and probably lower contrasted).\n\nI own a book, that is printed in Stempel Garamond. A dirty print in my opinion, because on the one page the text is relatively thin and on the other really fat. In other words, on one of the pages the original outline does not match with the printed outline. Nevertheless I enjoy reading it. It is very legible.\n\nWhat would you think, if the user enbolds one of your well-crafted fonts? Is the digital version of Stempel Garamond well-crafted? It is not the same as scaling, I know, but probably it is also not that, what you have wished, when you have designed your typefaces.\n\n"
