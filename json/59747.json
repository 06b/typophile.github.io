So far I am just getting my feet wet and sticking to the basics as I learn the ins and outs. As a designer who works in the print world 99% of the time, I’ve had the usual frustrations with typography that go along with the web.\n\nToday I discovered a new e-mail specific limitation. Not only is the type limited to a few faces, now size is an issue as well. I learned from a contact at our partner company, many e-mail clients will not recognize all font sizes and will automatically resize your type. For instance, 9 point type is a no go, it will either become 8 or 10. Although you can create an e-mail blast with any size you choose, many of the recipients will not view it as you intend. From what I have researched so far, the safe sizes are 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 and 36. Other sizes may work but most likely, not for everyone.\n\nI’ll continue with this if I find out anything different and I’d be interested to know how anybody else handles this issue. Hopefully this will come in handy to someone.\n\n",
