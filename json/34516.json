It was used frequently during the late 1960s by underground poster artists to give their artwork a psychedelic look._\n\n_Called posterization, the technique involved converting black-and-white or color photographs into a series of three separate negatives, each designated for a different color. They were then printed together, each slightly off register. The resulting images appeared to be multidimensional. (The effect cannot be shown in black and white.)_\n\n_In 1942 Mr. Weber invented and patented a photographic device that could change the appearance of gothic lettering by, among other things, expanding, compressing or ballooning it. The device helped to start a trend in special-effects lettering._\n\n_Another of his signature methods took continuous-tone photographs — including portraits and product images — and converted them into fine-line renderings, making them appear as pen-and-ink drawings or engravings. These and other techniques were known together as the Weber Process._\n\n [‹ Hoefler & Frere-Jones comment on the London Olympics 2012 logo.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204103241/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34548 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [about font redesign ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204103241/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34455 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Weber Studios on Madison Avenue in the early 1930s as an art and production service for advertising and editorial clients. In the late 1940s and early ’50s, Mr. Weber produced the original on-air nameplates for the CBS, ABC and NBC television networks before they adopted their more famous logos._\n\n"
