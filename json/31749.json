      "content": "If you haven’t already been through it, _Grid Systems in Graphic Design_ by Josef Müller-Brockmann is probably the best historical source you’ll find—a great piece of high modernism.\n\n_Making and Breaking the Grid_ by Timothy Samara is a decent book about Grids in practice, and has a few bits of history in there as well. Maybe not the best book research though, it’s more of a guided tour for brainstorming ideas. Still, with full color and bleeds, it’s pretty amazing that this can be had at under $20. There’s plenty more also, I’m sure you’ll get plenty of good input.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

      "content": "I think many designers work out systematic approaches but don’t share so much beyond the fundamentals. It has all changed a bit with digital type as well—not being bound to the point system so tightly.\n\nYou’ve got to keep a little for yourself, and this is so clearly a part of design where you can differentiate yourself.\n\n"
