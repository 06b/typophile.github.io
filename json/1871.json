For some reason it reminds me of Koch, or one of Hoefler's recent designs - I think the Gugenheim one. It has this quaint (but nonetheless Euro-rigid) air about it.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I think the cap Thorn should have a larger bowl; try 3x3 or 3x4 for the counter, but keep the 2 px extenders. This will push it up into the accent region a little, but I don't think that will be a problem.   \n   \nMind you, I'm not Icelandic. Perhaps someone who is can offer better solutions.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
