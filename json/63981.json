This on the other hand will be very difficult because I can't get hold of any real information on this type and I don't even know how to get a hold of it. I guess I have to email Olsson and ask. I can't even use the font in my print out.\n\nThe only information i have found is in the two links above. It would have been easier if I could use the font and try it myself I guess.\n\nIf anyone knows where to buy it or any information about the font I would be glad!\n\n"
