  "content": "I am using Dicot Medium in a logo, but the client asked if this is a system font. Honestly, I don't know. Nor was was I concerned... if it looks right, what does it matter if it is or isn't?  \nBut I understand the need for exclusivity and the safety of a custom or rare font for logo designs (it didn't stop Instagram... until recently). So I turn to you, fellow font friends. What are the origins of Dicot?\n\n",

Dicot isn't a system font on any system AFAIK but -being a freebie- isn't exactly custom or rare either... And I don't understand your search for its \"origins\".\n\nMy advice: Find a good font that's not free (which helps make it less common) and convince people it's a good idea to use it.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I think my mistake was not anticipating the need to purchase a new typeface in the proposal. I'll remember to include this in the next gig.\n\n@George: Yes, I think we're all adults here and realize one would normally find all of life's questions on Google. The answer is 42, by the way.\n\n@Michael: So Dicot is basically a ripoff or potentially a font from Photo Lettering?\n\n"

In any case, in this [message dated dec 2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821010157/http:/lists.runrev.com/pipermail/use-livecode/2005-December/071848.html), Mr. Saperstein speaks of FontBank as a thing of the past. That may explain those fonts that are floating around, free, without a EULA.\n\n"
