Comic Sans was not suppose to ship with windows it was suppose to ship and was made for an application. So SHAME on Apple to make a font that looks like Comic Sans. Now when will we see BanChalkboard.   \n   \nI made it to solve a problem with Microsoft Bob not to put into your computer. Apple made a similar font to put in your computer, didn't hint it properly and should be slapped for its bad choice. Show your face Chalkboard designer!!!!\n\n"

For most of us it's just a fun tease/release, or at most a way to lambast public ignorance.   \n   \nAnyway, this all is secondary to the fact that Apple is engaging in design plagiarism, instead of what MS did: pay a leading type designer to make them some original fonts.

If Peter Lofting were part of the Ban Comic Sans brigade (I don't recall a sticker on the back of his Mini) then producing this font would be a bit two faced, but as you say Apple has been a huge supporter of Comic Sans for many years, so why not do a similar font?   \n   \nComic Sans is hugely popular, and is used in mainstream advertising on a large scale. I don't doubt for one second that many of these commercial uses of Comic Sans are generated on the Mac.   \n   \nAs for the hinting quality, as I understand it hinting is not a priority for Apple - subpixel antialiasing all the way on screen, and the pros using the font for the next big ad' campaign are used to working with un-hinted fonts.   \n   \nIt may not be a case of 'think different' but it's certainly fulfilling a need for Apple's core market - professional graphic designers.   \n   \nCheers, Si\n\n"

As a self-proclaimed Comic Sans expert, allow me to offer this amateur criticism of the Comic Sans wanna-be, Chalkboard:   \n   \nThe poseur font lacks the angular components which offset the vertical stress of the main strokes in the lowercase characters such as m,n, and h. The overall effect of angular vs. square lending Comic Sans much of its spontaneous and \"fun\" quality is missing. Hinting aside, Chalkboard is a second-rate imposter face.   \n   \nSeeing them side by side makes me loathe Comic Sans a little less.   \nAs Apple fonts go, this is worse than Sand.   \n   \n-d\n\n"

I mean its letters, its forms, not its overall functionality as a system font which is very good.   \nI've broken my head over that so many Times and not found an answer. How you, the designer of my beloved Trebuchet, could have \\*drawn\\* the letters of Comic Sans?   \n   \nPlease forgive me, I think it's my obsessive care about comics and good lettering (even if today's computer and not hand lettering).   \nChalkboard: its unethical, it's unhinted, OsX antialiasing sucks (it makes even Georgia look ugly), but people using Comic Sans IN PRINT everywhere (I have just noticed a Hair Salon with their logo set on it, tremble) will hardly notice the difference.   \nAnd you may hate me for this, but if forced to choose just among two digital fonts in a post-atomic world where you need to do comic book lettering with a computer...   \nI would choose Chalkboard, I fear...\n\n"
