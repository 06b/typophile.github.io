  "content": "Williams Caslon Text has been used by Boston Magazine for nearly a year for their text face. Soon the retail version will be out from Font Bureau, with a lot of additional kerning and some more Open Type goodness, such as a short descender option, swashes, and Central European characters.\n\nMy overriding goal in this revival of Caslon was to capture the legendary reading comfort of the metal Caslons at text sizes. I can't fully capture the look of the design on screen, because what looks slim at size in print looks chunky when blown up on the screen. I also wanted to capture the aesthetic of Caslon: warm, inviting, and authoritative at the same time. In particular the original metal Pica 2 of Caslon, and the best revivals, has a distinctive 'dark but open' look.\n\nHere are some examples from the magazine. First, an intro spread for an article about college graduates coming out of college with no jobs, called Generation WTF:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WC_Bos_GenWTF_3851.gif)\n\nThey used my italic bigger than intended size, but because of the color and reverse, I was delighted with what they did.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WC_Bos_Generation_WTF_text_5138.gif)\n\nHere is a typical narrow column, with Williams Caslon Text just doing its thing quietly. I was surprised how it works so small, 9.5/11 points. It's designed to work with relatively leading. Note the bold small caps as a section heading:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WC_Boos_narrowcolumn_6044.gif)\n\nHere is a wide column, 10/11 points with Matthew Carter's Big Caslon at the top and Hoefler's Knockout--good company!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WC_Bos_wide_5942.gif)\n\nHere is a clever use of the regular small caps and bold italic, with color in the masthead. This is really tiny in real life:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WC_Bos_masthead_6212.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks, Tiffany. Yes, it has been a thrill to see it used by really sensitive and creative designers.\n\nThe main thing for me was seeing that the color was right on the page of a magazine, which I was really anxious about it. That was a relief.\n\nThen they did things that surprised me, like using it so small in very short columns, which turned out to be quite readable. And occasionally using the italic large, in color, which also worked.\n\nAlso it was nice to see that all those additional characters are useful. For example in doing the first line in small caps they could set \"Boston\", the name of the magazine, in small cap italics--and if need be in bold small cap italics, which their design pattern would call for in other circumstances. Also the small cap question mark they used after \"What happened?\" And in the new version there are small cap figures, so \"Sept. 11\" could be set with a barbed \"1\" that fits the small cap height.\n\nOh, and thanks to your and others' urging on Typophile, in the final version I made the stressed \"0\" and barbed \"1\" in the old style numbers default, and put the traditional circular 0 and \"small cap I\" looking \"1\" in a stylistic alternative set, which you can choose if you want.\n\nAt any rate, I can see that the months of work expanding the character set and kerning will actually be useful to good designers.\n\nThey also sometimes use this text size quite large, negatively leaded, in a kind of decorative text block. That has kind of made me cringe, because I know that the incomplete version of the Great Primer size (18 point) in my computer will look much better when it's complete. One day...\n\n"

      "content": "Nick, I wasn't really seeking authenticity in letter form. What I was seeking was to get the overall dark-but-open look and the reading comfort. When I didn't like something, I just changed it. For example, the a and g aren't W.C. but W.B. :)\n\nVery often when I tried to do Caslon better, I was humiliated because his proportions worked better. And so I often went back to Caslon in the regular roman. But some of Caslon's stuff is just screwy, like wildly different weights of caps. And he has some howlers, like the lower case italic s in some sizes. My theory is that he had an excellent eye, but just needed to get it out the door, so he just said, screw it, I'll get it better next time.\n\nAnd speaking of the italic, mine is far from authentic, but nobody's revival is authentic, partly because the original isn't very good. The 19th century revivals are \"improvements\", and so even Founders Caslon, which is based on them, isn't authentic. But then, I don't really believe that trying to be authentic is worth the candle.\n\nMine takes the original italic and redraws it both wider, which Carole Twombly also did in Adobe Caslon, and more upright, unlike what she did. I did keep the varied slants of Caslon's original, and not the revivals. I think that there is an inner logic in the variations that give a liveliness absent from other more regularized italics. But with the adjustments is more readable than Adobe Caslon's italic. So I'm pleased with the way it came out. The display sizes will be prettier, because of more contrast, when I get around to finishing them.\n\nI am also concerned about whether more kerning will detract from the look. I think not, but I'll only really know when I see it printed, in mass. The word space is not tight--it is 250 em units in the regular (x height 393). Also the letter spacing is slightly looser than Adobe Caslon, and the characters a bit narrower. Both of these are authentic to Caslon's Pica 2, and I think do contribute to the look and comfort that got Caslon its reputation. The overall effect is that it sets about the same as Adobe Caslon, but I think looks darker and more open because of various tricks I did--mainly following Caslon, but I'd like to think creatively rather than slavishly.\n\nThe lack of kerning in \"Yet\", above, to me is a bit glaring, and I think the proper kerning that is in the final will be a help without messing things up. I tried not to over kern--a number of times I did and tested and then pulled back--but I guess I'll only really know for sure when the final version is used.\n\n"

I think this typeface fills a serious gap, an authentic, yet not over-authentic, revival of Caslon that works well as a type for ordinary body copy.\n\nI do see _one_ problem, although that problem is not a criticism of the typeface itself. The decision to give Caslon a heavier weight is one that I endorse as something that was needed. In this face, though, that was done with perhaps a tad too much restraint and caution. As a result, and given that, generally speaking, magazines deal with a typographically-unsophisticated public, I fear that some potential sales of this font will be lost because potential purchasers may decide they can get much the same overall visual effect with, say, Baskerville.\n\nWhich marks the first time Caslon and Baskerville could be confused since the days of Ben Franklin.\n\n"

It means a lot from my fellow typophilers.\n\nStefan, as you know from working on Caslon, because of the big difference of different sizes and the rough printing of the original, \"Caslon\" is a bit of a typographic \"Rorschach test\", and different people see different things in it. Many revivals are very good, and very different one from the other--including Matthew Carter's Big Caslon, above.\n\nJohn (quadribloc), I don't think there is any danger of this getting mixed up with Baskerville. Actually, Abobe Caslon, being wider and because of the way it handles contrast is a bit of a \"Caskerville\". But in this the narrower characters (from Caslon's Pica 2 size) and lower contrast I think gives it quite a different look. Of course this is most obvious side by side.\n\nActually, one of the notions that guided me is that a really strong typeface design, such as Times New Roman or Baskerville is recognizable just from its texture on the page. Such a distinctive look was my goal here.\n\n"

I have then made certain choices, changes and additions from the original. Ligatures, SC, full CE and ornaments are things that have been added.

In some cases, when I decided to depart from Caslon, I repented and returned to his forms, but not in this case.\n\nKevin, there is a long answer to your question, which would be an essay on the history of Caslon and its revivals. And a short answer.\n\nThe short answer: I think of basic three kinds of Caslon: based on text size, based on display size, and only roughly inspired by Caslon. ATF's Caslon 540 and its revivals are based on the display sizes, with more heavily bracketed, pointed serifs, and wider characters with higher contrast. The ones based on the text sizes include Monotype Caslon and Merganthaler Linotype Caslon and Adobe Caslon. These are narrower and more slabby, but Adobe has a bit more influence from larger sizes. Big Caslon is based on display sizes, the largest ones. There are a number of Caslons that are only loosely inspired by the original, like Ed Benguiat's Caslon 224, which is more Benguiat than Caslon--not that there's anything wrong with that.\n\nThe thing I spent the most time on studying and trying to capture was the magic of Caslon's reading comfort. This has to do with a lot of subtle things put together: the weight and width of the characters, the spacing, the modulation of both straight and curved strokes, handling of the serifs.\n\n"

Theodore Low De Vinne, revered as the greatest printer of the 19th century in the US, praised Caslon to the skies, which probably helped promote the mystique. George Bernard Shaw insisted that all his works were printed in Caslon. And every major foundry had several versions of Caslon in the early 20th century. Printers said, \"When in doubt use Caslon.\"\n\nI don't know how much of this mystique had to to with readability, but I think a lot of it did. Writing in 1967 Ben Lieberman in Types of Typefaces wrote specifically about its readability, noting that the individual characters weren't so great, but the result in mass is very effective.\n\nMy suspicion is that part of the mystique came from the fact that it was the first old style to be revived. I do think that the high contrast types of the early nineteenth century were less readable, and that as a result Caslon seemed somewhat of a miracle when it re-appeared. When Monotype started reviving other old styles, I think it took some of the edge away from Caslon. But there was still something distinctive in Caslon that a lot of publishers and readers liked. I think it was reading comfort, but I can't prove it.\n\nCaslon didn't make as successful a transition to photo type and digital type, as it had from foundry type to hot metal.\n\n\\>How did that occur.\n\nYears of work. I just kept trying out different things until it worked to my eyes as a text face. Of course I have a definite idea about what combination of things was needed, but maybe it's better just to let the design speak for itself.\n\n"

Not better, just more popular.\n\nCaslon and Times Roman don't seem very similar on the surface - and they are very different in proportions and x-height. But they both have sharp serifs and slanted stress.\n\nI think that Bell, Oxford, Baskerville, Bembo, Poliphilus, and even a modern roman that isn't condensed could all provide plenty of reading comfort - but Times and Caslon, without compromising reading comfort, also have features that make them seem more brilliant - and that is the combination that worked for them both.\n\n"

I think your comparison of Caslon & Times isn't on target. The pointed serifs, similar to Times New Roman, are in the Caslons influenced by Caslon's larges sizes, reflected in Caslon 540 and Big Caslon. The Caslons intended for text, the originals as well as Adobe Caslon and mine, have longer, less bracketed serifs.\n\n"

Its significance was probably more in motivating the Miller & Richard \"old style\", which was a variant of the modern style.\n\n_Caslon didn’t make as successful a transition to photo type..._\n\nThat's not supported by its appearance in many major campaigns of the photo-type era, eg:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Honda_6482.jpg)\n\n"

In general the problems in transition to digital I believe were in text types, and display did much better.\n\nMy memory is not seeing so much Caslon in the photo era--70s and 80s--and of course being an old guy I lived and read before during and after photo type. But I wasn't in the graphics business as you were, so I may be wrong. (I'm not talking about Ed Benguiat's Caslon 224, which is an attractive display type but not really Caslon.)\n\nMy memory of the way the New Yorker looked then was that its Caslon was very anemic looking, but I may be confusing it with pre-photo type. The digital New Yorker Caslon, digitized based on the photo version by Bruno Maag, and worked on later by James Montalbono is pretty good.\n\nI think Adobe Caslon, the best text Caslon generally available till now, falls short of what Caslon was in metal as a text type, and I suspect it's been used more in display, though it was intended for text.\n\nAbove I think I mixed up De Vinne and Updike. It was Updike who said that the revival of Caslon in 'Lady Willoughby's Diary' was \"the chief typographic event of the mid-19th century.\" This was in the 20s, perhaps the height of Caslon's second wave of popularity.\n\nThe Miller & Richard Old Style is not a 'modern' face as Bodoni is. It is obviously influenced by Caslon, and its c and e have a backslanted stress. But most notable the contrast is much less than 'modern' types. It was evidently intended to capture the qualities of Caslon for those used to reading 'modern' style, and is called 'Old Style' for that very reason. --Revivals of Caslon were also at first called 'Old Style' as well. Your view that it is simply a variant of modern I don't think will wash, as it clearly adopts and adapts aspects of Caslon's look.\n\nAlso I believe that once the high contrast look was supplanted toward the end of the 19th Century, lower contrast types remained dominant for text ever since, at least in English speaking countries.\n\nWhy lower contrast won out we can disagree about, but the general view today is that text type needs lower contrast for good readability. So in hypothesizing that readability was an important factor, I don't think I am out of line.\n\n"
