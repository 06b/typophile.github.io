In particular I'm interested in graphic content: sketches, illustrations, photographs. The earlier the better. I plan to visit [St Bride Library](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017203141/http:/stbride.org/) in the near future, but anything else you'd like to add will be much appreciated.\n\nAn [example](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017203141/http:/www.artlex.com/ArtLex/ij/images/incunabl_printrad.lg.jpg) and an [example](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017203141/http:/www.fromoldbooks.org/Antisell-HandbookOfTheUsefulArts/pages/0493-Printing-Press/0493-Printing-Press-q75-1039x1167.jpg).\n\n",
