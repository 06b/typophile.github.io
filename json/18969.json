Think 'Slightly Smelling Leather Books'. :) Think 'Vintage'. )_\n\nI am thankful, as ever, for every single suggestion and hint.\n\nThanks,  \nDav\n\n",

      "content": "Lowercase would be interesting, albeit somewhat of an anachronism, as our lowercase is \"Holy Roman\" rather than Roman ;-)\n\nAlthough, the Romans only thing Roman's wrote in big, monumental capital letters (like Trajan), were big monumental inscriptions. So I think that Trajan is totally inappropriate for Latin poetry. The Romans had their own handwriting systems that they would have used for things like that. These letters never would have been as \"perfect\" as Trajan.\n\nMaybe you could used something like Trajan, but less perfect… like Trajanus or some of Goudy's faces. Although these are probably even more anachronistic…\n\nWhat about Renaissance type, or Italic? During the Renaissance, they starting printing all of these texts in Latin again… Renaissance type is as close to \"accurate\" and \"original\" as you might be able to get.\n\n"
