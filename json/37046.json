  "content": "Hi Typophiles, been a regular lurker here for a while, and now I actually have a question.\n\nI am looking for an approximation of the very elegant sans serif font that is the basis for the Houston Astros logotype. The font used is obviously NOT a script font like Fenway Park or Sarah Script but a nice sans serif font that has been connected to make a script font effect. Very nice and I think it increases legibility.\n\nAny ideas what the original font that the handlettering is based on might have been? I figure the uppercase A is custom drawn, but the other lowercase letters look very familiar....Hmm....\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312080508im_/http:/typophile.com/files/astros_5037.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "It's a mixture of script styles, with an s that is normally not connected and and r-style that usually is connected. 'Radio' that Stephen suggested uses the more conventional connected script 's'. This logo was probably designed to be script-like, but a bit more legible, as you suggested. I doubt if it based on any font, except in a vague 'generic' sort of way.\n\nIn my opnion it works from a distance, but doesn't look so good on close examination, like the 'Franken-font' it is.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
