      "content": "My opinion still hasn't changed - the font is still nearly illegible. It could prove useful by using the letter shapes to create texture and pattern in a design - but that means the font is acting less as a typeface and rather more as a design element. Again, everything (including usefulness) depends on what you're trying to communicate.\n\n"
