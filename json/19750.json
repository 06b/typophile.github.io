  "content": "Hey all,  \nI am doing a complete overhaul of my company’s Identity. We are a web firm that emphasizes standards in our design and builds. Anyway, I love DIN, I hate its @ symbol though and I am also starting to see it in too many places.\n\nSo I have started looking around and have come across a few typefaces that I like that maintain some of the things that I like about DIN...\n\nGreg Lindy’s Section ( [http://www.vllg.com/Lux/Section/mudTyper+Weights](http://web.archive.org/web/20091215143337/http:/www.vllg.com/Lux/Section/mudTyper+Weights \"http://www.vllg.com/Lux/Section/mudTyper+Weights\"))  \nChester’s Apex New ( [http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091215143337/http:/www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/\"))  \nMário Feliciano’s Flama ( [http://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights](http://web.archive.org/web/20091215143337/http:/www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights \"http://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights\"))\n\nI have been around the San-Serif block and am tiring of the same ol’ same ol’. I want something fresh that isn’t plastered on every billboard around town. That said, rule out Trade G, Franklin Gothic, Univers, Conduit, Bailey Sans, Helvetica, Helvetica Neue, News Gothic, Bank Gothic, etc.\n\nAlso, the type has to be refined enough to use as body copy. I am gonna use it everywhere. So before I choose what typeface to get in bed with I thought I would see what other typefaces you guys might think I like, based on what I have said.\n\n",
