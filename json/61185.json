Its called VAL and has a lovely rounded form with curved lines making it really striking and different.\n\nYou can find it here…\n\n[http://fontfabric.com/?p=585](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516054949/http:/fontfabric.com/?p=585 \"http://fontfabric.com/?p=585\")\n\nIts seems to look really good in simple short forms of type. Perfect for logos or headlines, though the legibility is not amazing, but hey, its not really about that!\n\nI also love the way it is displayed on this site. Gives good examples, but also shows the font as an alphabet form in posters with 4 fonts per page. I think this is a really interesting and original way of showing a font. It also directly shows you how effective it is in simple form.\n\nAnyway, hope you think its as nice as I do.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516054949im_/http:/typophile.com/files/002_5198.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516054949im_/http:/typophile.com/files/006_6017.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516054949im_/http:/typophile.com/files/valmilk1_6260.jpg)\n\n",
