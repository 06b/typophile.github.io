  "content": "Hi all,\n\nJust got a job redoing pretty much every visual aspect of a 5 person architecture firm based in New Zealand. They specialise in sports centres, education facilities and houses using a modern style; lots of use of corrugated sheet metal and glass.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for a font that might fit in with the kind of stuff they do? Added bonus if it’s produced locally here in NZ. It’d be used for everything - website (doesn’t have to be web-safe, was using flash for the website anyway), printed material, drawing annotations, and also their logo\n\nCheers\n\nRafe\n\n [‹ Looking for a kind of Gill Sans Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015160730/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46504 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [50% UV Spot Varnish ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015160730/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38273 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
