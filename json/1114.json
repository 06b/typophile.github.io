  "content": "As Flash websites have proliferated some typographers have taken to creating special pixel-based TrueType fonts which render cleanly and sharply at low resolution on such sites. Craig Kroeger, of miniml.com, gave a demonstration of this technique at TypeCon 2003. Such fonts act like bitmap fonts in that they are not anti-aliased and turn on specific pixels in a grid when displayed at the size for which they were designed.   \n   \nThe [Fontlab](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014105409/http:/www.font.to/cgibin/at.cgi?a=227536) guys were so impressed with this idea that they immediately sat down and hammered out a Python plug-in for FontLab that largely automates the process of creating one of these fonts. The plug-in, tentatively named FlashFonter, will quickly and easily create a \"pixel-font\" TrueType font for a specific pixel grid size from any installed TrueType font. No more fuzzy fonts   \nin Flash!   \n   \nYuri Yarmola of Fontlab will demo the first version of the plug-in at the Fontlab show and tell hour on Sunday, 28 Sept. at ATypI, Vancouver.\n\n",
