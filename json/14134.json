To further confuse matters there is another effect called inline which looks like [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20150323001703/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=inline).  \nI hope this hasn't confused you too much.  \nTim\n\n"

For instance, I wasn't aware there was only one correct way to name a face with a little bit of negative work done on it, so when I did such a face, I named it in a similar manner to one that had a similar effect. Hence Walburn Hand Tooled, after Goudy Handtooled. I was also aware that a number of ITC faces had that designation (Cheltenham, Garamond), so figured it was a reasonable precedent.\n\nThe main Open Face I knew was Bodoni, which has a different effect from the ITC fonts.\n\n"
