  "content": "I started work for a company that previously outsourced all their corporate identity jobs, and one of them was the creation of this logo. Apparently the font is Evangelic, but I can not find it online for purchase and the company who designed the logo conveniently “can’t ID the font” as it has been “lost”.\n\nThe “a” has been filled in, but i’m not sure if any of the serifs are true to the original font or if they have also been customised.\n\nMany thanks!  \nNatalie.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Majik-Logo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081209044901/http:/typophile.com/files/Majik-Logo.gif) | 3.41 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Giant Magazine cover type - Whitney {Tiffany}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081209044901/http:/typophile.com/node/20378 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Astroboy font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081209044901/http:/typophile.com/node/20389 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
