  "content": "The help/support PDFs I found at winsoft.eu indicated that it was possible to work in Roman/left-to-right languages by changing a few preferences in InDesign CS3 ME (Middle Eastern edition). The question I have is if this is advisable for someone who is currently working primarily in the standard version of Indesign CS3 for English and other Western European documents, who only occasionally needs to edit text in Arabic (this user is currently sending out the files for translation and text placement, and receiving outlined glyphs for placement as EPS files...kind of a mess). Also, this user is operating a Mac, if that is important (the translating company indictated that it might be).\n\nAlso, would it be a practical solution to install InDesign CS3 ME under an alternate user account, and just switch accounts as needed? Would this fubar the preferences for one or both of the editions of InDesign?\n\nThanks in advance, I realize this is sort of a complicated mess.  \nEnrico\n\n",

The language-localized Central European versions of InDesign made by Winsoft include some extra features for those languages (extra dictionaries, better sorting of indexes etc.). The Middle Eastern version of InDesign includes ALL those extra features for Central European languages as well.\n\nBefore InDesign CS2, there was a separate Central European version of InDesign because the U.S. edition only had dictionaries for Western languages.\n\nA.\n\n"
