For example, Is there a list somewhere that tells what languages Latin 1 + Latin Extended A will cover? I assume this is on the Unicode website, but i haven't seen a more unnavigable site in my life. if anyone can link me to this info, i'd appreciate it.\n\n",

PDFs here: [http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141002102317/http:/www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/ \"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/\")\n\nExamples from the European Alphabetic Scripts section:\n\n**Letters of the Latin-1 Supplement: U+00C0–U+00FF** (p. 167)  \nThe languages supported by the Latin-1 supplement include Danish, Dutch, Faroese, Finnish, Flemish, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\n**Latin Extended-A: U+0100–U+017F** (p. 168)  \nMost languages supported by this block also require the concurrent use of characters contained in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement blocks. When combined with these two blocks, the Latin Extended-A block supports Afrikaans, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Esperanto, Estonian, French, Frisian, Greenlandic, Hungarian, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Provençal, Rhaeto-Romanic, Romanian, Romany, Sami, Slovak, Slovenian, Sorbian, Turkish, Welsh, and many others.\n\n"
