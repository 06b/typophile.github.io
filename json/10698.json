I can't figure it out.   \n   \nIn fact, the pdf is kerning letters on it's own. Like two \"T\"s next to each other are suddenly touching when the FOG file and everything else shows them with plenty of spacing.   \n   \nurrr.   \n   \n-smc\n\n"

If I deleted the box the PDF was good.   \n   \nSo I just replaced the type and what do you know it worked.   \n   \nI was wrong. I blame Quark after all.   \n   \nI am going to try what Tiffany said just for fun. The only reason I have not done it yet was that if a client had actually purchased this type I would not expect them to have to do this to make a PDF. They should be able to just do it. But now that everything seems cool, I'll give it a try. I will still carefully examine the bit of type I deleted. Maybe there was a bad character.   \n   \n And embed all fonts is a really good idea.   \n   \nThanks again.
