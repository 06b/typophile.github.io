Since 2000 I have developed, with a lot of help from many typophiles (with and without capital T), five Font Identification Guides:\n\nthe [Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019235007/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html), which is probably used the most on my site, with its [Script Font Reference List](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019235007/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html);\n\nthe [Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019235007/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html), my first ID Guide;\n\nthe [Sans Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019235007/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html), which was the first Guide to use my Key letter identification method, and which is in the process of being replaced by the [new interactive version](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019235007/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php);\n\nthe [Lined Fonts ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019235007/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html), for multiline and inline styles;\n\nand my personal favorite, and most complete Guide, the [Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019235007/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php), which allows the use of the attributes of just 12 letters (a, b, e, g, y, E, J, K, M, R, U and W) to identify over 1,800 serif type families, including many pre-digital typefaces.\n\nThe Bowfin Printworks home page talks about custom spice labels and other graphic services, but these are how I pay for the web site, along with some donations from people who get personal font ID help from me via e-mail.\n\nThe site also includes the [Bowfin Pond](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019235007/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/BowfinPond.html), where I have collected most of my poetry and other writing.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
