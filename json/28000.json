Going in the other direction, of minimizing the idiosyncracies of letterform, you end up with Frutiger.\n\nParalucent is a grotesque with a couple of novel letterforms, and some interesting details.\n\nChalet is interesting, but it would require taking the “a” from 1960 (IMO the a is the quintessential LC Helvetica character) and putting it in 1980.\n\n"
