It sets like a charm too. Every word looks like a jewel. Man those Hoefler kids really know how to do it.\n\n"

Letraset's ['Follies'](http://web.archive.org/web/20150313163251/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/follies/) is modified more, but still quite similar. However, the '!' mark sets the 'identical' ones apart from the Erbar design, and Michael seems right about 'Phosphor' being the answer this time.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
