  "content": "I'm trying to identify the main typeface used in the 2004 German board game [<cite>Power Grid</cite>](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030831/http:/www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2651):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030831im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Power%20Grid_4729.png)\n\nI've found a few that are fairly close, including [Liquor Store](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030831/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/liquorstore/), [Refrigerator](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030831/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/refrigerator/), [Flim](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030831/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/flim/), and [Nicotine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030831/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine/), but I'd like to find an exact match if one exists. I haven't found anything that has that distinctive <cite>X</cite>.\n\nApologies for the poor scan; the actual type is very clean and not distressed in the least. If it helps, there are some more examples in [this photo gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030831/http:/www.boardgamegeek.com/images/game/2651?tag=Components). [Here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030831/http:/www.boardgamegeek.com/image/147429)'s an image that features the full set of numerals.\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for your informed reply, Stephen. There's a chance this is custom, although from what I've seen, there isn't much precedent for using custom fonts in eurogames. I don't think they typically sell well enough to justify the cost of commissioning a custom design; in fact, I often see them using free or very cheap fonts.\n\nI'm still holding out hope that there is an exact match that is commercially available somewhere. If it turns out that there isn't, I would very much appreciate a pointer to the closest alternative.\n\n"

This morning, I got a reply!\n\nIt turns out that the typeface is called Russka, and it was designed by none other than his girlfriend. (Maura Kalusky is male.) It's actually one of two fonts of hers that are used in the <cite>Power Grid</cite> design; the other one is called Waldmeister, and it's used for some of the text elements on the game box.\n\nAccording to Mr. Kalusky, Russka \"should have some kind of silkscreen aesthetics\", while Waldmeister \"looks like printing with rubber stamps\". Both fonts are available for purchase through him for €50 each.\n\n"
