I need your help.  \nThe logo uses Edwardian Script ITC  \nI used Adobe Garamond Pro for a headline and it looks (goes together) okay but I would like to know if there is a better go-together? Continuing with Edwardian Script ITC doesn't seem like a good idea (too fancy).\n\nAlso, for website copy, I need to select a default, would you use Verdana or ?\n\nYour guidance will be appreciated.  \nLinK\n\n",

When setting inline text one can always mix types in ways that distracts or detracts from the copy, which can be a problem, but otherwise just go for broke.\n\n"
