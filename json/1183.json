      "content": "Johan,   \nlooks nice, due to some details I recognize on the first view... The Uppercase C looks unbalanced compared to the rest of the alphabet. Try to increase the scale of the vertical axis a bit, and maybe also decrease the horizontal width a little bit. It's hard to tell... it could also be the antialiasing of the gif?   \nThe uppercase \"S\" are a bit low compared to the T. Increase the height a few steps.   \nThe \"A\" feels a bit too condensed.   \nThe \"G\" are nice!   \n   \nThe lowercases looks charmy, but you could try a few alternatives on \"a\" \"j\" and maybe \"f\"? I think those letters are the main language of your font, but I think you can do better... Compare the x-height on your \"f\" with your ligatures...   \n   \nNice work.   \n   \nA\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the feedback.   \nIn my eagerness to post my typeface I failed completely making the gif; of course the \"i\" and \"j\" dots should align as well as the \"f\". Sorry bout that.   \n   \nI've made some changes to the \"C\", \"S\" and extended the \"A\" a little bit. I've also done a draft of an italic.   \n   \nMike: lowercase \"a\" was the first letter I drew.   \n   \n ![monoline](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809190024im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15592.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Johan,   \n   \nI like it a lot. It's a friendly open type that, for me, is a good mix of the Helvetica, Din and Interstate.   \nPerhaps the UC 'W' could be a little more open. For my feelings it needs a little bit more white space inside. It works in the italic lc weight though.   \nI agree with Andreas on the UC 'C'. But keep the first lc 'a', it's right for the type. The alternate 'a' has been done enough allready.   \n   \nI like the italics. Nice work on the little serif of the lc 'r'. Moving it diagonally is perfect.   \n   \nThe type all together feels very Scandinavian. Perhaps find a name that comes from up there.   \nWaiting to see more.   \n   \nRegards,   \nRen\n\n"

      "content": "Oh, I like them. Although they are a little bit different from the regulars (because you gave them a sort of serifs), they work great.   \n   \nSome things you might want to look for:   \n- change the lc 'q' a little in relation to the lc 'p'. Try to give it a little more character.   \n- the lc 'a' seems to be to round in the upper left corner of the bowl. Optically it needs there the little 'serif' like on the lc 'm' and 'n'. If you take that away you might want to change the bowl a little to compensate.   \n- the angle of the lc 'o' is off balance with the rest of the type. Perhaps it is the jpg rasterization, but it seems to roll to much to the right.   \n   \nMy favorite: the lc 'z'. Sweet.   \n   \nWith the regulars it seems the lc 'a' is a little bit to round compared to, for instance, the lc 'e'. Can that be? It seems to be more a 'wide' than a 'regular'.   \nDid you optically correct the crossing of the 'x'? It feels a little out of balance.   \n   \nI really like this type, personally. Congratulations on the name. Very nice.   \n   \nSome of my remarks may be the result of the jpg rasterization on screen. In your document it might be OK.   \n   \nRegards,   \nRen\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Johan,   \n   \nYou really are still working on it. Nice update. I have some small suggestions for you:   \n   \n- spacing is too tight. I think you can give it some 20 em on both sides extra. Maybe more.   \n- I agree with Kevin on the lc a. Make it just a bit shorter.   \n- Have a look for the center of the UC's, they are not constant. Have a look at the middle bar of the A and the E. Try to find a hight that works for all the characters and be consequent. Take either the H or the R.   \n- Personally I think the bowl of the lc a is a bit big compared to the lc e. But note that that's personal.   \n- Perhaps you should make the leg of the lc l a bit longer?   \n- Have a serious look at the lc r. This is a tip Randy Jones gave me on my r:   \n [http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?29/32542](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809190024/http:/www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?29/32542)   \n- You need to work a bit on your numbers, they are a bit out of balance. Some seem to wide (2, 3) others to high (8).   \n   \nOther than that, I still like it.   \n   \nLater,\n\n"
