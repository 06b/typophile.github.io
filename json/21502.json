I can't make it to typecon this year and are also looking for something wider that (do I dare) \"just\" type. Now I love type - I do - but It's a long way from copenhagen and I wan't my moneys worth... if you know what I mean?\n\nSo should I just wait for next years typecon or is there something out there that is really cool attending? The obvious as well because I really have no idea about this...\n\nThanks\n\nMark,  \nCopenhagen\n\n",
