Matthew began that design while at Crosfield; and I think Crosfield only produced photocomposition machines. He finished the face when he came over to work with Mike at MLCo. But I didn't think it was cut in metal matrices. I could be wrong.   \n   \nAnyway, Auriga predates the design I have in mind, just slightly. But you're getting closer.   \n   \nRemember, it was a newspaper face -- newspapers being the last bastion of Linotype metal typesetting for many years.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

      "content": "Peter --   \n   \nIt seemed like you were just guessing, and I was going to make you pick one. But you may have caught me up on this one.   \n   \nMy answer was Olympian, designed for Mergenthaler Linotype Co. by Matthew Carter in 1970 for release in both metal matrices and photofilm. (The production drawings were done by the talented draughtsman George Ostrochulski.) My source for this was a conversation I had a month ago with Mike Parker, who was Director of Type Development. Olympian was the last new design to be cut in metal here in the States. It was designed, in part, to respond to the increasingly narrow restrictions of TTS standards. (Hey, there's another good trivia question: TTS -- what does it stand for and what was it? Oh well, next time.)   \n   \nWhen MLCo. closed down matrix manufacture here early in the 70s, they transferred all metal manufacture to Linotype & Machinery Ltd. (English Linotype). Tracy was typographic director for L&M, and it seems that Times Europa was cut by L&M a little later than Olympian. The evidence I've found suggests that it was indeed made for metal. Mike obviously wasn't thinking about L&M when we were talking.   \n   \n   \nAnyway, in either case, I declare Peter the winner.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

I hope this will be at least a bit hard:   \n   \nFred Goudy made a typeface/lettering for Pabst Brewing Company. In 1902 he released the typeface - \"Pabst\" - through ATF.   \nThe typeface was also released in Europe.   \n   \nMy question is:   \nWhat year was it released in europe, what was it called and through which foundry was it released?\n\n"

      "content": "Oh! Oh! I know this one!   \n  \nIn newspaper context, TTS stands for Teletypesetter. There were a few variants of this technology, but basically they all involved remote keyboarding and transmission by wire or cable (telegraph) direct to a linecaster, phototypesetter or, later, digital typesetting system. Although it would work with any font on the target typesetting system, TTS's efficiency contributed to the increase in content in daily newspapers, and so indirectly generated a large demand for condensed typefaces. I'm not sure if that's the impact on type design you were thinking of, Kent; I can't think of another, more direct impact.\n\n"

      "content": "John --   \n   \nI'm going to give this one to you, just to keep things moving along.   \n   \nThe third part of your answer, however, is not quite complete. The TTS system mandated a set of character widths, to which a font had to conform in order to perform properly. (I'm not sure why this was so, but I think it may have had to do with consistent line counts for the syndicated material.) These prescribed widths were fixed, \\*independent\\* of type size. As the tendency grew among newspapers to increase body size, the rigid widths meant progressively narrower letterforms and ever more condensed newspaper faces. That's the impact on type design I had in mind.   \n   \nApparently, much of Jackson Burke's tenure at MLCo. was taken up (regrettably) with most of his staff redrawing and recutting Corona over and over for TTS systems.   \n   \nWith Olympian, Carter and Parker took the lessons of the Legibility Series but applied an oldstyle stress. This allowed Carter to move the thickest point of a curve off the extreme horizontal positions, where space was at a premium, and thus achieve a more open counter on a narrower width.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the extra information, Kent. I wasn't aware of the fixed character widths. My guess is that this is not something inherent to the idea of TTS, but simply to its implementation in newspaper settings, e.g. to achieve consistent line counts as you suggest. In other words, the idea of remote keyboarding sent to a typesetter by telegraph doesn't rely on set widths.   \n   \nI'll post a new question shortly.\n\n"
