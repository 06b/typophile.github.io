I'm also thinking of the promos for the movie \"WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE\", as well as other advertising work. Stewf has probably built a list of random-looking casual printed fonts. (My list would include Randumhouse, Orion, Rats (w/alternate), Outhouse (w/alts), New Gothic Light, Mother Goose, Manosk First & Second, Tree Persimmon, Coffeedance, Avril, Arvigo, Swimsuit Boys, Cilantro, and Spaghetti Western)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

There is an authenticity to handmade stuff that's harder to get with an all-digital approach.\n\nAnd the funny thing is that it's almost always easier to actually draw/write this style by hand than it is to search for a \"handwritten\" font. Out of the thousands of handwritten fonts, only a few do it well. And they are all so particular. Each handwritten font has its own distinct personality.\n\nBTW, isn't [Spaghetti Western](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424044004/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spaghetti-western-wbw/) a fat face Egyptian?\n\n"
