  "content": "Hi everybody!\n\nI would need a font for my thesis, I don't need to use Times but the qualifications need to be: \"similar\" to Times: traditional serif, classic, high legibility.\n\nIt is an social science thesis, but it deals with more technical climate issues as well, so it can't be too playful. Italics are a must.\n\nBuilt-in fonts on Mac OS X:  \nBaskerville, Hoefler Text, Palatino, Times (&NR), Georgia, Garamond (not as tall as Adobe Garamond or other cuts)\n\nFreeware fonts I like:  \nBergamo. Day Roman (italics and bold then in Garamond), Lido, Efont Serif, Gentium, Calluna (+ paying for italics)  \n [  \n**Overview table** for comparison, rendered by Mac PDF function (Quartz?)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017062738/http:/img132.imageshack.us/img132/4862/screenshot20091208at100.jpg)\n\nOut of the presented I think I **Calluna** most, but would it be suitable for a thesis?\n\n- Which of these fonts provides the best balance between seriousness, legibility and a warmer touch? How does it work in a long printed text?\n- Do you think I should rule out a font with Old Style Figures? I will have a lot of quotes (Harvard System, 1984 p.999) within the text body. I prefer proportional Lining Figures.\n- Which sans (neo-grotestk or humansit) would go with the serif you suggest? I have the system fonts (Helvetica, Geneva, Gill Sans, Futura) and some free ones (Aller, Museo, DejaVu Sans, Quicksand, Fontin, Delicious, Segeo UI – MS Frutiger Copy).  \n.\n\nI would love to use Sabon or Arno, but well... to expensive for me.\n\nI know this is a somehow tiring question, but I hope for your help anyhow. :)  \nThank you very much for reading and commenting.\n\nFlorian\n\n",

      "content": "Ok, I would like to change discussion a bit towards another direction. Thank you so much for your input here, I think I will look for a first typeface to buy, and since this is a special thing, especially with limited funds, I would be interested in your input.\n\nI read the \"Choosing a font for book design?\" thread, so I am aware of the fonts there.\n\nI would prefer a font which was created for the digital time already in mind... if that plays a role. Something classic looking, easy to ready, serif, but still somehow new, fresh and a bit warm. Serif of course.  \nI need a roman and a italic version, and it shouldn't be too expensive.  \nOpenType would be good, so I can use the Small Caps function of my Wordeditor program.  \nThe font would be needed for longer texts, essays, PDFs (and this must be possible with the EULA - sorry MVB Verdigris), basically everything I would write and print or distribute otherwise.\n\nAre there any suggestions besides what I would consider so far, which is:\n\n- Sabon – maybe a tad to traditional, but very homogeneous in appearance, my favorite Garamond.\n- Janson Text – looks good, but is it really well digitalized? After W and Y there are big gaps, aren't there?\n- Minon – Really like it, has the right mix of everything, though maybe a bit to narrow?\n- Andron – I like it more than Arno ;) :D Though maybe a tad to classic\n- Eudald News, Edita, Whitman, Farnham – Anybody any experience with it? How do they compare with Minon and Janson? Would be interested in all these rather new fonts.\n\nBasically I guess I would be looking for something in between Minion and Janson, if that makes sense. I like about Minion that the letters seem all to match very nicely, everything flows into each other, the x-height is somehow right, but it looks a bit to dark maybe and to narrow.  \nJanson looks quite nice, somehow it is not a too far strech from Sabon for my eyes (don't know about their tradition), but less old-school. However I feel that with Janson Text the relationship of the space between the letters are not really perfect.\n\nI hope you see what I would be looking for?  \nAnd any experience with the latter four would be interesting to hear.\n\nthanks!\n\n"

But I can tell you that Renaissance in Europe was partly triggered due to Arabic/Byzantine influence in Europe with Islamic scholars studying the ancient Greek and Latin philosophers and continental Europeans rediscovered them due to this influence.

I had tried Warnock before, there is a book by Hamid Dabashi \"Iran, a people interrupted\" which looked great on Warnock, but when printed I guess paper and printer I used (average laser + a4 paper) didn't make a good impression. My two other options, Minion and Sabon, though great, didn't look as sharp (if that's the proper typographical term). I was one in love with Sabon, but now it seems rather cozy, too \"round\", and Minion looks a bit \"squared\". By contrast, the \"coldness\" of the sharp and slim forms of Arno, perhaps due to the fact that it was based on handwriting (a mix of Brioso and Minion), somehow makes me remember swords or metalblades, which is great, specially my subject(s).\n\n"

      "content": "@ ycherem:  \nIt is not really established in general knowledge how big the influence of the near&middle east area was during the middle ages for Europe. In math to medicine to philosophy there was a lot of research and a rich culture of literature, while in Europe a lot of knowledge was not lost bot somehow sleeping and it was a lot due to this influence that Europe started off again. No wonder the Renaissance draws on the antique, because this was exactly the knowledge brought back from Byzantine to Europe.\n\n@ Andres:  \nSound like a good idea, let's see.\n\nSince you say for you as a type designer it is interesting what the type loving customers think I will tell my criteria in this special search.\n\nI was mostly comparing the overall look of the textbody and how easy it is to cut through the text. The individual shapes matter in so far, as they contribute to a round and harmonic image of the textbody and are in balance with the other ones and of course as well look somehow nice by themselves. But I didn't inspect any letter close up or anything.\n\nIf anybody is interested in my totally amateurish thoughts on individual fonts:\n\n- Minion: close to perfect, a bit to narrow, dense, and it could be a bit rounder, but I would like to have this font later. Great to read.\n- Sabon: Totally different from Minion, but as well almost perfect, coming form the other, the softer side. This font made me fall in love with type though and I think is one of the most beautiful fonts and the best Garamond. I am not sure if the spaces between letters is always balanced, maybe SabonNext is better here.\n- Andron: I think it is somehow between (rounder than) Minion and (less traditional maybe... than) Arno and I like it better than Arno. It is less dark, a bit milder, looks very nice and sophisticated, should definitely be a serious consideration. Maybe update the website or make a parallel international one, just focus on the font? I like the sites of [Jos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017062738/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/index.html) and [type together](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017062738/http:/www.type-together.com/index.php) a lot. Maybe they are to \"pop\" for Andron, but I hope this font gains more recognition. A free roman font is a good thing. :)\n- Calluna: I like it a lot, it is sweet and modern, somehow a bit radical and still graceful. I think Jos Buivenga produces good typos like crazy ;)\n- I like as well Baskerville and Hoefler Text, but those coming with mac are for my purposes either to limited (I need OSF and LF) or are not the best cuts for body text, in my personal opinion. A closer look on Whitman and Eudald News might be interesting.  \n–––  \nAlright, so much about it. I an overview table might follow. :)\n\n"

Calluna is beautiful as well, not far away actually from Cycles. One thing I notice about Calluna is that the top curves of round small letters (a, b, c, e, g, h, m, n, o, p, r) is very similar and regular, which is even more obvious because of the \"direction\" Jos put there. This is not a good or bad thing, I don't know, I guess it has two effects: the image of the text becomes more homogenic, but maybe there is less for the eye to hold onto. I don't know, was just an interesting observation for me. Anyhow I think the comparison to Cycles shows that Calluna is a very high quality font. As the comparison Andron/Arno gives a similar results about Andron.\n\nAt least for my unprofessional eye. ;)\n\nCongrats to the good designers here on the board.
