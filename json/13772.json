All Blackletter types in German are referred to as \"Broken Types\" (_gebrochene Schriften_). Frakturs are the most decorative of the main Blackletter categories, as well as the most used, and the most quintessentially German (see [German Nationalism](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/German%20Nationalism)), even though they were also used in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, which are non-German speaking areas of Europe.\n\nThe Fraktur style of type was invented around 1517 at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor [Maximilian I](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Maximilian%20I) in Nuremberg. Many artists and designers were involved in the process, including [Albrecht Duerer](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Albrecht%20Duerer) and [Johann Neudoerffer the Elder](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Johann%20Neudoerffer%20the%20Elder).\n\nFraktur quickly overcame [Textura](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Textura) and [Schwabacher](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Schwabacher) as the main style of type used within the empire. The style got a boost after Martin Luther's first full-translation of the Bible into German appeared on the market—set in Fraktur. For a while, Fraktur was regarded as a \"protestant\" type. But it managed to be used by the southern Catholics, too.\n\nAfter the Napoleonic-era, Fraktur slowly began to loose ground against [Antiqua](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Antiqua), as the Germans called [Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Roman) type. It disappeared during the 1800s from the Netherlands, Sweden, and the Czech lands altogether. By 1900, almost all books sold in Germany that were translated from foreign languages, as well as most scientific books, were set in Antiqua. By 1930, only about half of all books sold were in Fraktur. After the Nazi ban on Blackletter type in 1941, the type slowly disappeared out the of public eye. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) managed to print a few books a year in Fraktur, but in the West (and today's Germany) Fraktur is usually only used in the following contexts: Typographic Games, History, Beer Labels, Gastronomy, Art Books, Heavy Metal, and Neo Nazi paraphernalia.\n\nSome of the most famous historical Fraktur typefaces have been digitized, and are available in digital form.\n\n_For information on these available fonts, see_  \n [Unger Fraktur](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Unger%20Fraktur)  \n [Fette Fraktur](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fette%20Fraktur)  \n [Fruehling](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730094936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fruehling)\n\n",
