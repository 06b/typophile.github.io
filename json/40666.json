  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI am looking for some good alternatives to **Tarzana Wide Bold Italic** , which I like for its overall round feel and softness. Having said that, I'd like to stay away from anything that has too much of a tech-y feel to it (ie. Neo Sans, Apex New etc).  \nSome quirks in the design are nice but not a must.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSeb\n\n",
