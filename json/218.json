      "content": "Well, I wouldn't say it looks so legible.   \nThere is a lot of odd stuff, for instance:   \n   \n-t is too high, and its crossbar too;   \n-it's too tight for this size. try 2 pixels spacing, \"stem-to-stem\";   \n-vwyz are wide (or are the other letters too narrow?);   \n-VW are really wide;   \n-bdpq looks strange: the bowls should be similar to o;   \n-x is narrow;   \n-A's counter is too closed;   \n-the numbers seems to differ in style from other characters...   \n   \nI think you still have a lot of work to do here.   \nGood luck.\n\n"
