Tell Charlie the dancing stones are restless. He will give you his van. Take Charlies van down the old mine road, but do not wake the straw man. Turn left on Comstock. When you feel the blood in your veins run cold get out of the van. Up the ridge there is a book outlining all the details of font design but it guarded by a Spectral Wolf.\n\nThe Spectral Wolf fears only fire.\n\nGood luck.\n\n"
