  "content": "Is it possible to save the argument of a new command in a string; i.e. NOT a box, and NOT a macro, that will run the argument every time it is called.\n\nE.g. the argument is \\cite{PhG}\n\nI want to save the result of this, but not so that \\cite is executed every time I use the string -- in which case I will get a different, undesired result, like \"ibid.\"\n\nI also do not want it to be a box, because I want to preserve the options to use either a hbox or a vbox.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
