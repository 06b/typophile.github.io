      "content": "I think it's a huge advantage staying in the actual conference hotel. You only have to walk drunk and not drive drunk - the \"Law of Averages\" becomes much easier to handle.   \n   \nBTW, I've stayed at a Nikko once (Bangkok), and it was pretty classy, but very reasonably priced. But you don't want to know what \"niko\" means in Arabic.   \n   \n\\> no rock garden can be seen   \n   \nYou just reminded me of something funny that happened to me during the ATypI-Rome conference: the hotel I had found (on the web) said it had a roof-top pool, and I even remember seeing a photo of it. When I got there, the first thing I saw behind the check-in desk was an overly-prominent photo of the roof... with a huge flat area where the pool was supposed to be! I asked the guy \"What happened to the pool?\", and he says \"We never have the pool.\" Very suspicious, I say.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
