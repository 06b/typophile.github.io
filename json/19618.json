I’m trying to identify this typeface, which has been in widespread use in National Geographic maps since the 1960s.\n\n[(image)](http://web.archive.org/web/20071220194929/http:/wtf.myfonts.com/images/b7/b7ac88f58765bb03121a9e570f16fc73.13762.gif)\n\nIt works really well when used in mixed case for short words (town names, etc). [Here](http://web.archive.org/web/20071220194929/http:/www.globecorner.com/i/t/GWgermd.GIF) you can see it used as part of an atlas.\n\nI’ve heard that National Geographic has their own “customized fonts”, but really something close will suffice. WhatTheFont turns up nothing (it even crashes) and Identifont is just way out in left field. I’ve also Googled this to death and found nothing. Another example is attached.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [temp.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071220194929/http:/typophile.com/files/temp.jpg) | 15.29 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Bruce Mau \"Massive Change\" book cover - Impact {Geoff}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071220194929/http:/typophile.com/node/19637 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Nestea logo - based on Friz Quadrata {Stephen} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071220194929/http:/typophile.com/node/19621 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
