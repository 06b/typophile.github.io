Does anyone know of some inexpensive fonts which are similar to:\n\n- Requiem  \n- Mercury Display/Mercury Text  \n- Gotham\n\nI know that you pay for what you get as far as quality goes, but I can clean up the files in fontforge. Would really appreciate any help with this.\n\nBest, Shaun\n\n",

You will not find cheap versions of good type though. So save up and get the good ones. Any project you use them on will be all the better for it.\n\n"

They're a little more expensive, but their price tag is fair, and far less than some of the _truly_ expensive foundries.\n\n"

Proxmia Nova is very close to Gotham and he can purchase the individual weights he can use now and the same for the other fonts. There is such a thing as the 'broke designer'.\n\nAs for your malfunctioning analogy about the Porshe... if you can't afford one- you buy a Miata or S-2000 and get equal thrills. As with cars or type designers there is somebody making type at your budget that does it right too.\n\nIn fact I think Proxima Nova has better harmony of the capitals and lowercase than Gotham does.\n\nMike Diaz :o)\n\n"

It was the absurdity -- for me anyway -- of the original question that struck me. You know: cleaning up an \"inferior\" font in FontForge. It would take a lot of work and you still wouldn't have a good quality typeface. You better license something decent at a somewhat lesser price, just like the excellent suggestions Stephen and others made. Mind you, while I'm not exactly broke, I _do_ have to carefully consider every personal type license myself, so I know what Shaun's talking about.\n\nAnd to avoid any misinderstandings -- I certainly can't afford to drive a Porshe, but then again I don't exactly feel the need to. Alternatively my drum kit and my three kids fit in the back of my second-hand minivan and I'm perfectly fine with that.\n\n"
