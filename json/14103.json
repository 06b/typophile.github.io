  "content": "The Berlin-based type foundry of Dutch designer [Lucas de Groot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230650/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lucas%20de%20Groot)  \nIn 1997, having worked as a type director at MetaDesign Berlin for four years, De Groot founded his own type production company, FontFabrik, specializing in creating custom fonts for magazines and corporations.  \nThree years later, he created the LucasFonts brand for his growing library of retail fonts.  \nDesigners at the studio include Jan Fromm and Elena Albertoni, who have both won acclaim for their own type designs as well as contributing to the design and production of De Groot's typefaces. Many of the LucasFonts typefaces were originally made for a specific client and a precise purpose, such as a newspaper (Taz), magazine (Spiegel) or corporate identity (Corpid, Sun). The most successful type family issued by LucasFontsis is the Thesis superfamily (TheSans, TheSerif, TheMix), which was originally released by FSI as a FontFont in 1994, but has been a LucasFonts product from 2000 onwards.\n\n**External Links**  \n [Official Site](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230650/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/)  \n [LucasFonts at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230650/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/foundry/lucasfonts/)\n\n",
