The SMS from your mobile is sent to a Punchcut phone, then the message is transferred (sucked out) via bluetooth to the Mac on the podium. We averaged 1 SMS every 15 seconds.\n\nMy favorite was \"...and God created Punchcut!\"\n\nSome others:  \n\"Punchcut or Punchdrunk?\"  \n\"Turn off the mess it's annoying\"  \n\"Hi mark\"  \n\"Whatever!\"  \n\"I only text in papyrus.\"  \n\"They didn't want music downloads either.\"  \n\"Sing the Bitstream song.\"\n\n"
