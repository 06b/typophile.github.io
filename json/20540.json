I am looking mainly for ideas for type treatments for a shirt I am making for the team that I coach. Any websites/images/books that have similar inspiration would be great. Thanks!  \n-Jesse\n\n",

Any online resources or books devoted more to type than logos?\n\n@fontplayer:  \nActually I think the type treatments on their home page are more of what I am looking for. Edit: ahh I see you have to go to script then click on the individual fonts to get the different treatments. Though these are a bit more basic treatments like the ones in The logo font and lettering bible. Basic drop shadows and gradients, etc.\n\nI think I need to look for illustrators who do type to find the more interesting type treatments. Thanks!\n\n"

[http://www.misprintedtype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104164335/http:/www.misprintedtype.com/ \"http://www.misprintedtype.com\")\n\nFour Minutes to Midnight (2356) has some great magazine spreads using different fonts and layouts to communicate the context of dialog printed. Not sure if thats the kind of treatment your after however. [http://lokidesign.net/2356/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104164335/http:/lokidesign.net/2356/ \"http://lokidesign.net/2356/\")\n\nFor more magazine spreads I dont think you can go past Peter Maybury, He has some beautiful typographic spreads, particularly his work on Code magazine is most impressive.
