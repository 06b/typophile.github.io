K, H, Y) are heavier than others (i. g. C, G, X).  \nFor example, stems of H are quite bold (H looks heavy next to some other characters – maybe make the right stem a bit lighter?).  \nThere are sort of funny angles in W.  \nRight serif in U is almost a slab serif (for balance reasons?).  \nIn my eyes, some serifs seem to make for slightly clumsy feet (like in P, Y) and stand in contrast to the strong overall stroke width modulation.\n\nPlease understand that this is not a balanced critique (I focussed on what I considered possible problem zones) and that not everything that struck my eye is necessarily a bad thing. I just wrote what came to my mind.\n\nJP\n\n"

Weight them up to match the thick stem serifs (see the I vs C)  \n• Curves need to be smoother. Its hard to tell in a gif, but the R and P for example seem to have a corner going from straight to curved.  \n• Y should join lower  \n• W should be wider and the angles corrected as mentioned.  \n• The leg of the r feels like it bends to much.

Do\n\nThis kind of early rational grid-fitting in type design is definitely facinating (such as the Romain Du Roi), though I wouldn't be very excited about using the results for text. It suffers from many of the issues that happen when an engineered approach is applied to letters. Again the thinking is interesting, but the results flawed. For example you can clearly see his Y is based on the X. But that pushes the crotch too high. And the X is made of 2 straight lines. But optically the thin stroke looks broken. The bottom of the Z is too narrow (because it's exactly the same width as the top). Same with the S. F crossbar is too high compared to the E. Likewise, the P too high compared to the R Not to mention the proportions suffer from being crammed into a box. Etc.\n\nMaybe for your purposes, try less fixing and use a straight interpretation as a starting point.\n\nRandy\n\n"

      "content": "Most of the changes I've made are in pursuit of harmony. Typeface design involves a good deal of philosophy. So-called \"humanist\" philosophy accomodates and encourages anomalies, aberrations, inconsistencies attributable to a human effort eschewing modularity, matching angles and widths, and dogmatic abeyance to the grid. So-called \"modernist\" philosophy favors the opposite. The changes I've made can easily be construed as reductive modernism aimed at modularization. While I dislike modularity and have moved away from it in my own type designs, modularization is to some extent an inescapable function of the desire for harmony.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417093902im_/http:/typophile.com/files/evenwidth_4209.gif)\n\nWhich phiilosophy, if either, is appropriate for this font? If it had angled stressing, proportional character widths and calligraphic artefacting or finish, the conventional answer would be Go Humanist, let it all hang out baby! But the plot here is vertical stress, even width and a strict synthetic finish. According to conventions in type design, modernism wins. According to convention this is a modernist type, not old style.\n\nAcceptance of conventions in type design is not mandatory. You're at liberty to reject them.\n\nI don't see any reason to drop the bowl of Y as Randy does. That kind of preference seems to be a personal one---years ago I had the same preference, but presently I favour Y's that harmonize with X. Nevertheless, I'm glad Randy made the suggestion as it is no less valid than mine and he has every right to make it.\n\n\\* A -- widened. I used a flipped V. Now it looks a tad too wide.\n\n\\* C -- overshoot corrected, fixed upper serif.\n\n\\* D -- narrowed. Why? If you make D wide (enough) the counterspace starts to rival the counterspace of O. Is that really a bad thing? In most fonts the capital O contains the largest counterspace of any letter, and the same can be said for the lowercase o of \"most fonts\". The reason has to do with saliency and cueing value in relation to readability. The large counterspace of an O is thought to have a significant saliency or explicit cueing value that helps the eye / brain reading hardware recognize it as an O. If that's true, a wide D with a cueing value rivaling O might compete with O for recognition. The most visible example of this is Helvetica. Another reason for keeping D narrow is enhanced elegance. Elegance seems to be one of the key characteristics of this font. Wide fat D's look ungainly.\n\n\\* E -- extended crossbar fills counterspace, creates more even tone and density. Thickened crossbar.\n\n\\* F -- same plot as E.\n\n\\* G -- overshoot corrected, fixed upper serif.\n\n\\* H -- widened, solves former heaviness problem without narrowing stems. H width now approximates N, increase in harmony.\n\n\\* K -- redesigned so that diagonals harmonize with X.\n\n\\* L -- narrowed for improved fit with other letters.\n\n\\* O -- overshoot corrected.\n\n\\* S -- baseline overshoot corrected.\n\n\\* W -- new unit built from two overlapping V's. Diagonal angles harmonize with V and A.\n\n\\* Z -- corrected horizontals, serifs replaced with E units.\n\nAnother thing to reconsider is J. The thin part looks a bit thick, and it sports the sole ball-end in the caps set. In settings combining the caps with the lowercase the ball end will blend in, but in all caps settings it will stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nKeep going with this font. It's been done before, many times over, but it's a good learning opportunity.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Other type designers discovered the same thing long before I was born, and the general consensus is that reductive design is a _cul de sac_---the types are consistent, and efficient, but not much fun compared to designs in which the lower case preserves pen-derived rules of construction. People desire idiosyncracy but thrive on eccentricity in the same breath.\n\nI think x, y, and z wound up at the end because they're the least-used letters. A bit like Google and the internet, the pecking order is based on relevance.\n\nI call the gapped Q a \"phantom\" letter because part of the structure isn't there, or is not shown, but spectators infer the missing parts from experience of complete examples. I borrowed the term from anatomy / medicine, where amputated limbs are called phantom limbs because 1) they used to be there, 2) amputees experience a \"phantom limb effect\", percieving the missing limb to be there, much like seeing a ghost. This Q isn't a particularly strong example of a phantom glyph. A better example is a P with the stem section between the bowl removed, or an N with one stem removed. Aldo Novarese designed a typeface featuring a large number of phantom letters--- [Stop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417093902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stop/). Disappointing that page at Myfonts has no description of Stop. I should talk Laurence Penny into letting me write one for them, it's such a significant face.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Probably more so than the differences between upper and lowercase.  \nI meant really that the original scan here had not x, y, z but x, z then y. Maybe just visually more interesting than x, y, z.  \nI know Stop, which i initially thought was exciting, but seems to be used rather badly on the whole. I've seen 'phantom' ampersands or dollar signs in other fonts too. :)\n\n"

Of course that if I can make it a commercial product I will. For that I need to see its \"value\" at the end. Again James is rigth when he says that a set of smallcaps will help it \"appeal to more tastes\".\n\n2- Like stated before my source is a old typographic book. Again and again I think james is rigth: the order for the x, z, and y its because they’re the least used letters- We dont use Y in Portuguese words!\n\n3- The caps (at the end) are quiet diferent from the caps at the beginning. I think I will do the same \"learning curve\" for the lowercaps and the results will be much more interestings that the first one!\n\nI will \"study\" all sugestions and do a re-design. Stay tunned...  \nThanks all for the support!\n\nAntónio\n\n"
