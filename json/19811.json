On Hoefler's site it says 'originally drawn for Harpers'... does this mean HFJ Didot is not necessarily used in the publication 'now'?\n\nMikey\n\n"

You're most probably right about H&FJ Didot being used for heads. Sorry'boutthat.\n\nAnd I _am_ bald, using that as a nickname for my online persona, so you're entitled to call me Bald if you wanna. :^P\n\n"

I still have my hair but it looks like its not staying for long- genetics suck!\n\nThanks for elucidating the word 'nameplate' too. HFJ have interpreted Didot's work nicely- very sexy proportions.\n\nAlthough if Jessijohn had a mac, she would probably be satisfied with the version of Linotype Didot (interpreted by Andrian Frutiger) that comes standard with Mac OS X and save herself $299.00. Linotype Didot comes standard with small caps- something HFJ Didot does not have. However, a thorough compliment of optical character sizes is standard equipment for HFJ Didot.\n\nMikey\n\n"
