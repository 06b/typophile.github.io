By searching the web, the earliest issues showing this typeface I could find were from 2005, thus, the typeface must have been designed in 2005 or earlier. It looks so familiar, maybe because it's similar to Farnham?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070337im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Playboy_5558.png)\n\n",
