  "content": "Hello again, guys!  \nI’m with a new question for you. I like the so-called old-style numerals, with 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 having descenders, and 6 and 8 having ascenders. Also I like the Roman-like number 1 of fonts such as Bembo and Centaur.  \nAccording to what I’ve found searching on typefaces, the fonts Aldus, Arno, Bembo, Emerson, FF Scala, Goudy Old Style, Requiem and Sabon all feature old-style numerals, with Bembo, FF Scala, Requiem and Sabon showing the I like numeral for 1. Of these, I have Goudy Old and Sabon available in my PC, however the numerals are regular, nothing of old-style, only a slight overshoot of 4 and 7 in the Goudy Old. Also the 1 of Sabon is regular. Why? And where can I find some typeface that has truly old-style numerals?  \nCan you help me, please?  \nThanks in advance.\n\n",
