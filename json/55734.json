H is rather wide in comparison to O as well.  \nAlso I would consider reducing contrast in H, K and X.  \nO looks a bit odd with the interruption, you might consider leaving O and Q uninterrupted.\n\nGood luck!  \nArtur\n\n"

      "content": "Thanx for the comments. I can see what you mean with the O. It get's a bit messy maybe.  \nWhen I started this typeface I had a couple of rules wich I based all the characters on. The most important one was that I wanted all characters to look like they could be drawn in one fluent motion with just one line without the line crossing itself.  \nObviously I had to make a few concessions. But maybe I have to make a few more. The capital and lowercase 'T' don't work with my concept in mind (which you'll see soon hopefully).\n\nI'll try levelling the bar on the H a bit so it doesn't look as much like a mirrored N. Also agree that the X K could use a tiny bit more contrast.\n\n"

You have good forms going - let those guide you, instead of some imaginary irrelevant factor.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I'm pretty happy with the results so far. There's some kinks that I can see for myself but another pair of eyes are much appreciated.  \nI traced all the characters in Illustrator, so the spacing is done by hand and without very much care so again, apologies for that.\n\n"

It will be included though.\n\n@Terminaldesign,  \nI agree with some of your points and others I don't understand.  \nDo you think all round forms have an awkwardness to them? I tried to use as little anchorpoints as possible to keep it fluent, but some characters, like the S, I couldn't make without some extra anchors.  \nWhat do you mean with the 'weights are oddly place and the tops seem too heavy to me.'?\n\nThe spacing is a bit random and will totally be re-done once I start putting all the characters in Fontlab. It was 4 am when I started spacing it all in illustrator, so the motivation was a bit lacking as you might understand.\n\n"
