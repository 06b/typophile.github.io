  "content": "I'm sick of using my cheap inkjet printer and having all of my text come out fuzzy.\n\nWhat I want in my prints is dark and crisp text.\n\nWhat type of printer do I need to achieve super crisp text? And what type of paper? I'm not looking to buy anything super-expensive, just the proper stuff that will meet my needs.\n\nI'm printing mostly high school coursework. Cost-effectiveness is also a plus, I'm sick of replacing my ink so often.\n\n",

      "content": "I recently purchased an hp p2015 for a couple hundred bucks from newegg. It's 1200x1200 dpi and the text quality is really nice so far. My only complaint is that really thick black areas (+.5\") lose density in the middle but I'm running garbage thin recycled paper through it. A smoother, brighter and more opaque paper would look great, try some Hammermill Great White if you want something decent.\n\n"
