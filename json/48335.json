  "content": "Hi fellows. I just relocated all my stuff to the beautiful town of Ålesund on Norway's west coast. To speed up the networking process (finding an apartment here can be quite a hazzle) I created a Facebook profile.\n\nIt seems quite a few of you have joined the typophile group over there, but without the nicknames I'm having a hard time locating friends and foes. Anyone care to share their real names?\n\n",
