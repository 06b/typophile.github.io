  "content": "Hi, just a quick one.\n\nI am using small caps to write ACC. A sentence within a paragaph begins \"ACC is aware of the...\".  \nNow, do I use a normal capital A, then two lc 'c's?. This looks like 'Acc' becuase the small caps 'C' looks very similar to a lc 'c'.\n\nCheers.\n\n- Chris\n\n",

Standard writing practices would be, if it's appearing for the first time, to write it as, \"A Common Cold (ACC) is aware that there is no real cure.…\". Then after that it is acceptable to refer to the acronym.\n\nAlso, if you follow the \"never start a sentence with a #\" rule, spelling it out would be a perfectly acceptable alternative. Or stick a filler word like 'the' in front.\n\n"
