Three families — a serif, slab serif, and sans — are derived from a single design concept. The monospaced FF Nexus Typewriter plays well with the others, too. This breadth of options, combined with OpenType features (such as built-in small caps, alternate glyphs, and optional swashes) make FF Nexus an extremely versatile type system.\n\n**External Links**  \n [FF Nexus at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723233936/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF+Nexus)  \n [FF Nexus fonts at FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723233936/http:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/nexus-serif)\n\n",
