  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nCurrently I'm helping a friend out. She's an Interior Architect who recently started up up her own business. Her clients are (richer) private home owners and companies (mostly headoffices). The logo should both reflect being a small studio, as well as have a professional enough look for the bigger companies.\n\nI'm almost set on the logo, which represents a house, with a pencil inside (interior) and is a capital A \\> the first letter of the studio name.\n\nBut now having troubles with the lockup. The type is Univers, and not kerned yet.\n\nI would like to hear your reactions on the logo, and suggestions on the typography,\n\nThanks,\n\nMarco\n\nNEW DESIGN BELOW\n\n",

I didn't pick up the figure-ground-reversal at first. I didn't even get it on the second or third time. I believe you're trying to have that duality of image but frankly, it's not working because the balance isn't there.\n\nSome observations:  \nThe rounded corners throw me off; makes me think \"children\" or \"immature.\" There's no sophistication here. Is there a reason you haven't ALL CAPS? You have a lot of vertical movement with the House and Pencil illustration, which can be cool, but you need to follow it with the typography.\n\nQuestions to ask yourself:  \nIf she's fun/funky, why not tilt the house? Capitalize on the fun/funky 'cause that's what's going to set her brand apart from anyone else.\n\nArchitecture is about the 3D form, yes? Why leave this as a 2D logo? What would happen if you add depth to the illustration but kept the concept of the pencil within the house?\n\nbest regards,  \ndaniel\n\n"
