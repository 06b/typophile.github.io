  "content": "I'm looking for a display font for a book about American folk art. I want something funky and handdrawn, but not novelty or wedding-invitation-y. Seems like the vast majority of script faces out there are just silly.\n\nStorm's [Rondka](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420003016/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/rondka/) is really close, but too slanted for my purposes. I like that it's deliberate, not like dashed-off handwriting, and not too ornamental.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",

Stanyan Autumn is way too casual, Coquette too stylized (though I've always loved it), Mahagony Script too journal-y. Stefan, Montessori is really nice and not at all silly, but also not quite what I need.\n\nI'm really looking for something that looks like it was labored over, but labored over by an amateur. Something like a Brothers Quay title card. Something like the attached image, which is a portion of a piece in the book...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420003016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/doodle_4805.jpg)\n\n"
