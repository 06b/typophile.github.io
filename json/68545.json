Just wondering if anyone had undertaken something similar?\n\nCheers\n\nDuncan\n\n",

For example,\n\n[Fiendstar Cameo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416045834/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/aviation/fiendstar-cameo/)\n\n[Blitzplakat](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416045834/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/blitzplakat/)\n\nHowever, be warned that searching for the term \"cameo\" on a font website will bring up fonts called Cameo as well as fonts with cameo (reversed) weights, and even some fonts with no reversed weight at all! So you will need a bit of patience...\n\nFor example, here is [a search for \"cameo\" on FontShop's site](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416045834/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=cameo&x=0&y=0).\n\nA [search for the term \"reversed\" (on the same site)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416045834/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=reversed&x=0&y=0) also yielded some results.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\n"
