Good analogy too. ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416080549im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)  \n   \nFWIW this was started in 1991 using nothing but Fontographer. I put it away for several years and started making some adjustments recently, but what you see here is hardly changed from what I had almost 10 years ago.\n\n"

The serifs seem to need a little work, perhaps. The serifs in certain instances seem slightly overbearing: at the apex of the UC A as well as the lc e, for example.   \n   \nDoes the UC M seem a little timid? (Perhaps the middle should extend further down?)   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \n//joe\n\n"
