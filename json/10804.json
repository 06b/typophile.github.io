      "content": "My inspiration for this typeface originated when I was walking around the Nelson museum looking at early Mayan pottery. I found the hieroglyphics to be very interesting in their shape and use of line. I thought this would make a great font. I have chosen to work with the earlier style of Mayan hieroglyphics instead of the later style which is more decorative.   \n  \nI am still continuing to work on this font so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   \n  \nThanks, Megan   \n ![Mayan Typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017115711im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7928.gif)\n\n"
