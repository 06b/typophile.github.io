Later, when I designed my first font, I realized, how much work went into it and my perspective shifted. Today, I try to be accountable for all my actions in my daily life, so I arrived at a place, where giving something back seems simply the natural thing to do.

Even though we do our best to educate him (and I do believe in educating them, one at a time, too) say, hypothetically, he's not going to be converted. Then some lurker emails him privately:   \n   \nFont Trading: A Play in One Act   \nby Dyana Weissman   \n   \nLurker: Hey, Stereotypical Font Pirate, I have Magneto. What do you have to trade?   \n   \nPirate: Well, I actually have the entire Font Bureau library, N-Z. Relay is peachy keen!   \n   \nLurker: What a coincidence! I have the entire Font Bureau library, A-M. Let's trade! Amplitude sure is dandy!   \n   \nPirate: Oh that's great! You know I have 30 friends who have been trying to get copies of Amplitude!   \n   \nLurker: I have 30 friends who have been trying to get their hands on Hoefler's entire library.   \n   \nPirate: Funny you should mention it, I have their entire library. Plus some fabulous gems by Peter Fahrni.   \n   \nLurker: Great. Gotham Condensed is so nice. I'll trade you all the P22's I have for 'em.   \n   \n-End Scene-   \n   \nI don't think there's ever a single act of piracy. Of course, my shamelessly plugged little scenario is catastrophizing, but this does happen all the time. I \\*still\\* have friends, who went to art school with me and know me personally and SHOULD KNOW BETTER! who \\*STILL\\* ask me to find them free fonts. Some people just don't care. My question is, when cases like this do arise, on Typophile or elsewhere, what should we do about them? Should we email the moderators with requests to have them removed (after, of course, patiently trying to educate)? Or is it a lost cause?\n\n"

That seems a little ... un-private, especially as that fact (assuming it is the fact) doesn't seem to be stated on the page where private messages are composed.

Thats really the closest thing you will have to privacy in this world.   \n   \nConsider the fact that you send email, through an ISP I suppose. There has to be somone to administer that mail server, correct? Somone set it up, and keeps it running. That person has access to all your emails, sent or recieved. Not to say that that person has the right, or even the slightest desire to sift through all of your correspondence, but they do have the ability.   \nIn short, things don't run themselves, they have to have some sort of human interaction, even if it is as little as 'turning them on'.   \n   \nI don't think Jared was trying to imply he sifts through private messages, but in the circumstance that something 'shaky' surfaces, he is stating he does have this ability.   \n   \nMake sense?\n\n"

I certainly realize that private email isn't truly private, ever, but I don't think the ISP server administrator example is exactly on target here. I can't really picture an administrator at msn/aol/earthlink routinely checking people's email for objectionable content. And, as I understand it, it takes a court order for people outside the ISP to see that email (in other words, some amount of privacy is generally regarded as expected). (However, I do know that employers routinely scan the mail of employees, so there are wide variations in expectations of privacy.)   \n   \nIt seems, though, rather more that Jared is saying that private messages connected to controversial threads and/or to controversial posters is monitored and if the content of those private messages is unacceptable to the administrators, then the author of the private message is permanently kicked off the forum. (Though, that is really closer to your interpretation of what Jared said than anything Jared said.) I don't know ... the old lefty in me just finds that troubling, if true. My problem.
