I am desparetly trying to find the font used in [http://www.inkd.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090818174118/http:/www.inkd.com/) or [http:/www.iloveny.com](http:/www.iloveny.com). Its like a slab serif, Rockwell or so, but with more distinguished characteristics. For instance, the lowercase l, t and h are long in height.\n\nI tried whatthefont and identifont, but no success here.\n\nI am sure you guys can help me with this. Or maybe somebody can show me a perfect match free alternative, would be amazing..\n\nI am bloody rookie in typography, but well there is always a start.\n\nThanks.\n\nThis is an example.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090818174118im_/http:/typophile.com/files/user_resources_faq_header_5688.gif)\n\n",
