  "content": "CheapProFonts is a fresh site which is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting “foreign” languages (languages requiring more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\n\nIn this news release I present 14 fonts:  \n- 5 from Ray Larabie  \n- 4 from Brian Kent  \n- 3 from Kevin King  \n- 2 from Nick Curtis  \nI am very grateful for these four designers letting me rework their freefonts for the professional market, and I am looking forward to showing you more of their lovely alphabet designs in the coming months :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090814212330im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/CheapProFonts-NEWS-08-Q1_5730.gif)\n\nThe selection of fonts is pretty widespread - I’m trying to cater for a wide variety of needs for display fonts early on, and then broaden the selection within each category as the site expands.\n\nI find it a bit hard to believe it’s only been 3 months since I first got the idea for this site!  \nIt has been a lot of work with the site itself, but I have managed to rework and release about one font a week - actually a bit more than I thought I could manage so early on. I’m pretty satisfied with how the site looks and works now, so I can spend even more time of the fonts - which is what YOU are looking forward to :)\n\nCheck our site for constant new releases.\n\nRoger S. Nelsson  \n—  \n [http://www.CheapProFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090814212330/http:/www.cheapprofonts.com/)  \nHigh quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers with a small budget!\n\n",
