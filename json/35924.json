Any ideas?  \n [http://www.linotype.com/9214/linoletterblackitalicosf-font.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019003933/http:/www.linotype.com/9214/linoletterblackitalicosf-font.html)\n\nCan you tell me more than the quoted text below about LinoLetter, especially the \"curved slab\" serif-form? Are they unique, inspired/used by Font-??\n\nLinotype writes: \"Designer: Linotype Design Studio, 1992. In the 1980s, Linotype worked with the Basel School of Design (Switzerland) to create a new typeface that would be maximized for optimum legibility. Professor Andre Gürtler oversaw the research for the project, along with Reinhard Haus and the Linotype Design Studio. The goal was to create a typeface to work with contemporary typesetting and printing technologies. Linotype released the result, LinoLetter, in 1992. Legibility typefaces are designed for printing under the poorest and most varied of conditions; LinoLetter is therefore ideal for newspaper work as well as other mass-produced printed pieces.\"\n\nthanks\n\nThorsten Geiger\n\n",
