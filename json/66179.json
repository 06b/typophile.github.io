Apart from obviously beeing stretched, I don't think that other adjustments have been made to the letters. Any suggestions will be highly appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017054902im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GELUND_6596.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Some odd things seem to be happening here. The uneven arms of the E (both weight and length) are not usual for slab styles; the bracketing of the serifs seems inconsistent, particularly the middle arm of the E. The G seems to be missing a 'beard'. I searched for freebie serifs, but didn't see this. I searched the Serif Font ID Guide, but couldn't find anything that seemed even close to matching.\n\nMy guess is that this is an amateur customizing job. Are these all the letters you have?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
