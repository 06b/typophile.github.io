  "content": "Typo is proud to announce the release of a new font family \"Loreto\"\n\nThis font gets its inspiration from the typography of the Manuale ad Usum (1721), printed by Jesuit missionaries who worked at the beginning of the XVIII century with communities of \"Guaraná\" native indians from the Northeast region of Argentina.  \nIt is a manual of sacraments published by Paulo Restivo and some collaborators among the native population. This manual features the peculiarity of being the first printed piece where there is a record of the place where it was printed: at the Loreto mission.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013140431im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Loreto-550_6510.png)\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tipo/loreto/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013140431/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/tipo/loreto/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tipo/loreto/\")\n\n",
