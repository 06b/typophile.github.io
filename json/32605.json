  "content": "Hi  \nI’m looking for a Dingbat to work with Joshua Dardens Freight Display. So, a classic style with different nice arrows, symbols. The use is for a Scandinavian cultural magazine (high brow) if that helps narrow it down.  \nA fast glance at fontshop didn’t really help me out... :( Type Embellishments and Arabesque & Rococo Ornaments are to the right direction but not quite it.  \nThanks.\n\n [‹ kerning](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907155225/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32638 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [looking for specimen ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907155225/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32609 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
