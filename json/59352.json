Can anyone help me or is this just a custom script made specifically for the logo. I seem to recall that there is a community outreach program in the Tenderloin in SF (can’t remember the actualy name) but they have a logo that riffs off the Caltrans logo and they have the same script. Please help!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090627023817im_/http:/typophile.com/files/caltrains_typeface_5216.jpg)\n\nEDIT: It’s CityTeam Ministries!

Caltrans probably had theirs designed for them, the other outreach group probably used a freeware font for theirs. See the Techno categories at Dafont.com for possible styles that may be close enough to the Caltrans look.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
