Here it in use:\n\n[http://www.paramountarts.com/20080824foreigner.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20131207033857/http:/www.paramountarts.com/20080824foreigner.php \"http://www.paramountarts.com/20080824foreigner.php\")\n\nIf you can get past the horrible publicity photo, it's used on the line of copy at the very top of that page. Of course, the missing letters from the logo could have been fudged, but anyone know if it exists?\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [foreigner\\_logo2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131207033857/http:/typophile.com/files/foreigner_logo2.jpg) | 32.45 KB |\n\n",
