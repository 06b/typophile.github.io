This style is rooted in the Art Noueau period and was most strongly influenced by the lettering of turn-of-the-century Viennese poster designer Alfred Roller.</cite>\n\nBoth [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007164048/http:/www.linotype.com/2509/mojo.html) and [Identifont](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007164048/http:/www.identifont.com/show?RU) state the year 1960. If that’s correct, [Jim Parkinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007164048/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Jim%252BParkinson) did the typeface when he was only 19.\n\n"

Either that or I’ll name it after my own birthyear ;-)  \nThanks anyway for your help!\n\n"
