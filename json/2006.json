All leads on books he's written, or been featured in, have run dry for me. Any information that doesn't turn up on google searches for \"Wim Crouwel\", \"New Alphabet\", or combinations of the two would be appreciated.\n\n",

If you want the   \nfaces themselves (\"what the wall shows\") they're   \nsold by TheFoundry as it was mentioned.   \nOf course, the 'New Alphabet' is a 'conceptual'   \ndesign - a proposition for a CRT face (the main   \ntext of the booklet is set in Univers). That's   \n1967 of course. Some theoretical aspects behind   \nit are developed in an article Crouwel wrote in   \nthe Journal of Typographic Research (=Visible   \nLanguage), in its Winter 1970 issue: \"Type Design   \nfor the Computer Age\".   \n   \nOn Crouwel himself, the main reference is   \nFrederike Huygen and Hugues Boekraad's   \n_Mode en Module_, a thick _catalogue raisonné_   \n(Dutch-only unfortunately), nicely designed by   \nKarel Martens and Jaap van Triest (though I   \nhave problems with some aspects of its printing).   \n   \nR\n\n"

      "content": "Brian: no, I don't have that issue of the   \nJoTR but I had access to the article all   \nthe same. It mentions the New Alphabet only   \nvery briefly. The gist of it is that type   \nin the computer age shouldn't be based on   \nthe old, hand-derived forms. I quote this   \nsentence that might delight our friend   \nHrant: \"Writing by hand is fortunately a   \nvanishing skill.\" (Exercise for HHP: compare   \nCrouwel to Gerrit Noordzij). Instead, the   \ninner \"modular\" logic of the computer should   \ninform the structure of \"letters\". Crouwel   \ncalls that a cellular structure - which can   \nbe represented by \"dots\" (I think the word   \n\"pixel\" wasn't current yet in 1970). Only,   \nthe concept of a cell is richer and more   \ncomplex than that of a pixel or dot. The   \nsigns formed by these cells - \"enlarged   \ncellforms\" - he wouldn't call \"letters, but   \n\"nuclei\", the grouping of _nuclei_ not \"words\",   \nbut \"units\". Together, _units_ form a   \n\"communication\".   \n   \nR\n\n"

As Paul Stiff replied to Noordzij in Typography Papers (#4), type is about \\*reading\\*. Not the hand, not robots, not dead Italians.   \n   \nBrian, I'm an \"alphabet conception\" guy (as MyFonts calls it), but I don't do Wim - sorry.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Both of them   \n(Noordzij, Crouwel), in their opposite ways, seem   \nto be preoccupied with the formation of signs   \nrather than their reading/decoding (I think that's   \nan over-simplistic assessment however). In any   \ncase, Crouwel's progressive approach (and let's   \nput it in context, that's 1967-70 - at least six   \nyears before R2D2) seems healthy, especially   \nwhen so much typography and type design today   \ntend to a certain smug regressiveness... ;)   \n   \nregards,   \nR\n\n"
