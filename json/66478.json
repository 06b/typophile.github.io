Would using a third font for body be overkill?\n\n[http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4292433135\\_0195d0c208\\_o.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420022748/http:/farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4292433135_0195d0c208_o.jpg \"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4292433135\\_0195d0c208\\_o.jpg\")\n\n",

      "content": "You need to really pay attention to the kerning in your title.\n\nA crude but good way to start with kerning is to imagine water filling the spaces between the letterforms. You are attempting to adjust the spacing between characters so that the amount of water is about the same or similar between each letter. Over time you'll develop a keener sense of balancing out the negative space.\n\nIt's a small detail but it helps to improve the tightness of the composition.\n\n"
