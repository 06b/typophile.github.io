If yes, do you know where I could find a copy of the old logo?\n\nThis is an excerpt from the MEC Annual General Meeting of 2006 which is where I based my information from, but it is pretty vague, and it could be mistaken:\n\n“Steven Brown was the gentleman who developed the logo that has been in use since the time that he developed it. I think it was about 1974, and I just wanted to acknowledge him.”\n\n[http://images.mec.ca/media/Images/pdf/MEC\\_2006\\_AGM\\_Transcript\\_v1\\_m565775...](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021045758/http:/images.mec.ca/media/Images/pdf/MEC_2006_AGM_Transcript_v1_m56577569830602539.pdf \"http://images.mec.ca/media/Images/pdf/MEC\\_2006\\_AGM\\_Transcript\\_v1\\_m56577569830602539.pdf\")\n\n"
