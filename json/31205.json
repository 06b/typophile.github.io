  "content": "I use tables in Indesign for lots of layout control purposes - they are fantastic for building very complex grids and forms. I often use them to build graphs as well, even simple bar graphs, but am having a big problem now.\n\nI’ve made a dozen similar bar graphs, and had to resize them all slightly (using consistent scaling of grouped objects) to fit a new layout. I didn’t resize them all exactly the same - they started out at different sizes and ended up with the same width; some are taller than others. Thus, the text in the various fields is now at sizes like “7 pt (11.2 pt)” and “9 pt (13.8 point)” and I need to make it consistent throughout. Using paragraph or character styles (new ones) doesn’t work, as the overall resizing of the table (105%, 117%, 140%, 82% etc.) seems to exert magical resizing powers on the text … I can’t copy and paste, either - text is resized upon pasting into the enlarged or shrunken table.\n\nHow do I release these stupid resizing percentages, and have them all - at the size they are now - become 100%, so that I can make type size consistent between all of them?\n\nI demand typographic consistency, even if my client doesn’t notice. Arrrr, it be drivin’ me nuts, as the pirate said to the barkeep.\n\n",
