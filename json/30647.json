  "content": "Our magazine uses an allcaps cutline style and recently the copy chief has requested some clarification on the proper setting of a name like MCCARTNEY in a cutline. It looks odd to my eye, but setting it as McCARTNEY opens up the door to all sorts of questions like how to do \"d'Yquem\", for example. D'YQUEM or d'YQUEM? DEL VERDE or Del VERDE. Thanks in advance.\n\n",
