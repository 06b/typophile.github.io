I have gone through the required process of various search engines and type foundries, without any luck.   \n   \nPhotoshop insists that the font is called \"stem\", but so far I have not been able to find a single font with this name, perhaps it has mistaken the name?   \n   \nAnyway here is a sample image:   \n   \n ![echtzeit means realtime in german](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205014300im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40774.gif)\n\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; Henry Cotton&#39;s - Belwe {James}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205014300/http:/typophile.com/node/5649 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#40;x&#41; Demand Response - Century Gothic {Eduardo} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205014300/http:/typophile.com/node/5642 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
