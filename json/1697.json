Does the Windows version export fonts for PC and Mac? I have a Toshiba laptop I'd like to use simply for its portability, but I want to be able to create fonts for both platforms.

If you take a PC formatted zip disk and transfer Mac files to it and then read them on a PC, the resource fork is listed as a separate hidden folder titled resource.frk. I don't see why something like type tool can't just do that.   \n   \nI've tried Crossfont's PC to Mac export and it didn't work for me. The fonts were screwed when I was able to test them on the Mac. It compresses them into an hqx or bin file which keeps the resource data intact so it should've worked. I've only tried it the one time, so I might've missed a setting or two.\n\n"
