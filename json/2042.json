      "content": "'Larissa' is one of many names for a font whose correct name (I think) is ['Ballantines'](http://web.archive.org/web/20101222041829/http:/www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=Ballantines). Other names are [Biorst](http://web.archive.org/web/20101222041829/http:/www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/biorst.htm), Dianna, Cotillion, Balladeer, Progena & Premi. I have linked to two of them, as Biorst is only $2. You might use Fontseek to look for some of the other names if you are willing to take your chances that you will find an uncorrupted copy on a 'freeware' site. Considering that what you are looking for comes from a non-digital piece of sculpted type, I think this is a fair approximation for the style you want to match.\n\n"
