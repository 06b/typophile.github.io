  "content": "Hi All,\n\nHere is a typeface i'm working on. I'm very new to this, so any tips would be great!\n\nThe intention for this face was to create some using a 6-square grid (2 columns of 3 squares) to create each chatacter, also i was thinking of making it mono-space, but seeing it in action makes me think that is not a good idea...\n\nI'm doing this mostly to start learning the art and craft of type design, but i do intend on using it in designs to see how it holds up.\n\nThanks heaps!\n\n",
