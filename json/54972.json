These designs are examples of what Tschichold, in his austere modernist mode, called ‘artists’ typefaces’. They already had a high profile in the graphic arts, so it was a good move on the part of the founders to exploit their distinctive lettering as type, and call it by their names. I think it’s best to see these ‘designer’ faces in the new and very competitive context of type-making of the early 20th century, when the founders, threatened by the Linotype, felt a need to market their large bodied faces more aggressively. And in both France and Germany the marketing included a pretty powerful charge of national feeling.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321225527im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Grasset%20500_6195.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321225527im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Eckmann%20500_6193.jpg)\n\nIt seems to me that the first instincts of Morris Fuller Benton took him in a different direction. He developed an impersonal design with the bland name of ‘Cheltenham’ (the type that resulted is a long way from the lively original sketches by Goodhue) and then marketed all the variations that were made in house as members of a must-have ‘family’ of designs, like Cheltenham Condensed, Cheltenham Bold, Cheltenham Bold Expanded, and so on. But since ATF’s ‘classic’ names like ‘Bodoni’ and ‘Garamond’ sold pretty well too, they marketed the designs they bought from Goudy (and to which they gave a slick, professional ATF treatment, rather to his irritation) as ‘The Goudy Family’. And of course Barnhart Brothers and Spindler, who stayed independent from ATF, exploited the name of their one star in-house designer Oz Cooper, as in Cooper Black. ‘Star’ as in Hollywood, of course, which led the way.\n\nApart from Gill (a special case) English Monotype mostly stayed with high-profile classics, like Garamond, Baskerville and Fournier. Being dead they did not ask for royalties.\n\n"

He was a designer, rather than a type maker, getting a professional punchcutter to realize his own ideas of what a type should be. He was selling what in France would called a ‘look’: an overall concept that covered type, paper, layout – everything. At the same date (1750s) Jean-Pierre Fournier (the elder Fournier) used the legendary name of Garamond to sell the original 16th-century types, for which he had matrices.\n\nI've been trying argue recently that the name of Caslon did not become a typographical ‘brand’ until the last of the Caslons had died, and the owner of the foundry (called Smith) was promoting the so-called ‘Caslon Old Face’ as a unique and genuine relic – a claim that led to all kinds of problems.

And they drew them very well. Goudy's pupils in Chicago, Oz Cooper and W. A. Dwiggins, didn't do badly. The results were simpler type designs that could be made with Benton's new pantographic technology.\n\nAnd since – as we know because he took good care to tell us – Goudy not only sold designs to the type makers but made several of them himself, cutting his own pattern letters in cardboard, he wanted, understandably, to promote his own name. Unlike Grasset and Eckmann, fine artists whose names promoted their types. Making your own types at home and selling them. What an unheard of thing to do.\n\n"

I was wondering the same thing - but at best the type would have been named for the ruler or official that commissioned it, not the designers who did the work.</cite>\n\nHere's what I can find about names of Korean typefaces.\n\nTypefaces that were commissioned by the Korean court were typically named after the name of the year in the [sexagenary cycle](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321225527/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle). For instance, Gabinja was made in 1434, which was a _gabin_ (甲寅) or a 'yang wood tiger' year, and Gyemija was made in 1404, which was a _gyemi_ (癸未) or a 'yin water sheep' year.\n\nByeongjinja, made in 1436, a _byeongjin_ (丙辰) year, is also known as Gangmok Daeja because it was used for the big (_dae_) letters in the _gangmok_ (綱目) style texts, which mixes two sizes of letters. It is also known as Jinyangdaegunja, because it was based on letters written by Grand Prince Jinyang (Jinyang Daegun).\n\nThere are a number of other cases where typefaces are known by those whose lettering they are based on; Gabinja was also known as Wibuinja based on a false attribution of the letters to Madam Wei (衛夫人, _Wi Buin_ in Korean), a Chinese calligrapher. Gabinja was actually based on the letters found in a number of books deemed to have beautiful lettering in the style of Zhao Mengfu another Chinese calligrapher, with Grand Prince Jinyang supplying the missing letters.\n\nHanguja was a typeface made in 1677 based on the letters written by Han Gu, a noted calligrapher of the time.\n\nThere are also typefaces known by the names of the publications they were used to print, or by the name of the person in charge of making them, especially if they were not commissioned by the court but by private individuals. Yulgokjeonseoja was made by a group of private individuals to print the _Yulgok Seonsaeng Jeonseo_ (The Complete Works of Yi I, also known as Yulgok), and it is sometimes known as Honggyehuija after Hong Gyehui, one of its principal commissioners. I'm not sure if these names were given at the time they were made or later by type historians.\n\nAll the typefaces I mentioned are those used for Chinese characters. Typefaces for the Korean alphabet don't seem to have been given separate names at the time.\n\n"
