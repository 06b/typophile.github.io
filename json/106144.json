I have seen it elsewhere too, in the english section of Japanese instruction manuals for instance.\n\nWhile looking around the net, I have found quite a few fonts that are very close to this (using WhatTheFont and similar services) but none of them have managed to suggest an exact match.\n\nMicrogramma and Eurostile are quite close, but there's no cigar involved there... An important detail to match is the rounded-square nature.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n New Rodin (Fontworks) \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062144/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

This might be [New Rodin](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062144/http:/fontworks.co.jp/font/classic/newrodin/L.html) by Fontworks (font sample [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062144/http:/fontworks.co.jp/font/classic/newrodin/L.html#cont02)). To be positive, I guess we should wait the confirmation of [Akira](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062144/http:/typophile.com/user/4504). He is definitely THE specialist, the man of the situation.\n\n"

Thank you very much Ryuk.\n\nI'll let this simmer for a while to see what Akira says, but otherwise it looks like you've nailed it.\n\nEdit: Been checking the details, and I'm positive that Ryuk is correct. First post updated with credits. /edit\n\n"
