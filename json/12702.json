  "content": "Hy,\n\nFor some weeks I'm looking for a robust text face look like Dolly but less curvy, a little more agressive, a bit more literary.  \n[article about dolly: http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/21831.html]\n\nI want to replace fournier I´m using on this technology and art magazine - [www.nada.com.pt](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211524/http:/www.nada.com.pt/ \"www.nada.com.pt\")  \nFournier is too light and it has some problems.  \nDolly its almost what I want...\n\nthank you,  \ngranjam\n\n",
