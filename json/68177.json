So first of all:\n\n- this logo is for a company that's primarily in agile software development business but a part of it also in graphic design; that's why all the colors.\n- Pleiado is derived out of Pleiades, seven stars, that are also related to _similar minded group of people_, which relates to team software development.\n- circles represented as bubbles are just part of this draft; they may be replaced with anything; stars as well...\n- bubbles start on top of the \"i\" to replace the dot on it.\n- bubbles overlap to give a sense of dimension\n- lifting shapes (in draft's case bubbles) give a sense of lightness that I can easily relate to Agile principles\n\n@Bendy: I agree I could place bubbles (shapes) more sporadically to not pose an exact shape and make them more playful\n\n@ricardo: I thought to deliberately overlap shapes in the final version (possibly with a hint of transparency) to relate logo to visual aspect of company's business (graphic desing).\n\n**@everyone** I definitely didn't intend to relate this logo to pharmaceutical industry. The thing is **I don't know how to relate agile software development** with visual elements. I don't have a workable idea. Except growing/composing shapes/sizes/weights... but that's just growth. No agile-ness in it.\n\nI still want to make this logo professional but not bound to square/round shape.\n\nI thought I could place lifting smoke over type... It would make my logo design a bigger challenge (think of Silverlight logo), especially because I MUST make it work in BW as well.\n\n**Now that you know much more, would you change your opinion or suggest new things or give some additional observations and directions?** Please do.\n\nThank you very much and I hope you will all (at least the ones that did so far) reply again.\n\n"

I'd lose the gradient fills and be really selective about the colours used. If you could invent a shape instead of bubbles or stars, that could be used on its own as a mark for other things.

My particular concern was that your audience can't say the name correctly. Personally, I would always want them to \"get it\" right away, just the same as I don't like people mispronouncing my own name.\n\nBut for the business, is it detrimental? Will people be likely to remember the name if they aren't sure of which way to pronounce it in the first place? Same goes for a recommendation of your business--will the person who is told, \"Play-ee-ah-do,\" (or whatever) \"does great work, you should go with them.\" Will they remember?\n\nPerhaps it's wont affect leads--that would be based on your business model and how and where you approach your marketing.\n\nSo litera I'm curious what you think, and if it's not a problem why--it's always fun for me to think through things and learn something in the process.\n\n"
