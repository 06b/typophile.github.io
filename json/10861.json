The Turkenkalender (1455), other Donatuses and other Kalenders, as well as broadsides were printed with it. It evolved into the face used for the 36-line Bible (1458-1460), and others, which were printed in Albrecht Pfister's Bamberg workshop.   \n   \nThe capital P here is a indicator of difference from that of the textura in the 42-line Bible (the Gutenberg Bible) of 1455/6 or the Mainz Psalter, 1457.\n\n"

The French Black Letter used in the northwestern areas of Europe by Pynson, Hopyl, Wynkeyn de Worde, Caxton, etc. But I can't identify the specific face or the printer.   \n   \nFrom its setting, I would think it not a twentieth century revived face.\n\n"

This one's a bit outside of my research interests. I'd say Caxton simply because the needed supplementary information would be the four books.

This was used in the Ordinale seu Pica Sarum, Horae ad usum Sarum, A Psalter and the Westminster handbill. Caxton's type passed on to Wynken de Worde who printed a number of books with it.   \n   \nCaxton's other lettre de forme were the Type 5 and Type 7 and Type 8.   \n   \nType 1, Type 2, Type 4, and Type 6 were batardes.
