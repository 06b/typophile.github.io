  "content": "Looking for a classical Dutch typeface other than those by DTL and Teff (which I can’t afford), I hit upon Monotype’s Van Dijk. The regular shape looks clean and readable, and some alternative figures are simply delightful (look at the three!). Unfortunately, the italic is said to be so badly designed and so poorly spaced “that makes it a very uninteresting font to use in digital form”. (Norman Walsh)  \nMy issue: does anyone know Van Dijk? Or have seen it somewhere applied? Is it worth to be bought regardless of the italic? Thank you!\n\n",
