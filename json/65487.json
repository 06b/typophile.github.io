Let me point you to the design project, by Chip Kidd, of Nabokov’s posthumous “The Original of Laura”:\n\n[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/books/s\\_656078.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103055836/http:/www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/books/s_656078.html \"http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/books/s\\_656078.html\")\n\n“Instead of typed or handwritten pages, Vladimir Nabokov left behind 138 3-inch by 5-inch index cards that his son took painstaking measures to organize and arrange to create “The Original of Laura.” Each index card is replicated exactly, with words crossed out, underlined or erased, and Nabokov’s notations, and printed on stock that is similar to note cards.”\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103055836im_/http:/typophile.com/files/card-a_3742.jpg)\n\nAnd another interesting Nabokov book cover treatment:\n\n[http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11597](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103055836/http:/observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11597 \"http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11597\")\n\n",
