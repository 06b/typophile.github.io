I just get the feeling that they're leaning over.   \n   \n\\* The ear of the 'g' is softer than it needs to be with respect to the other serifs.   \n   \n\\* It's probably just me, but the curved transition on the top of the 't' feels out of place.\n\n"

Very polished already.   \n   \nIt sort of looks familiar (although I'm not saying you swiped anything) - I guess it reminds me of Caecilia, although it's less humanist (which I think is working great).   \n   \nThe \"g\" is really nice! I do see a bit too much humanism in it though (compared to the rest), so maybe make the joins (especially between the head and bottom) more rigid.   \n   \nFor the \"t\", try making the curve two straight segments instead. And maybe cut the finial like the \"e\".   \n   \nThe \"s\" seems to be leaning a hair forward.   \n   \n\\> I have found a (subtle) slab very fulfilling to make, don't quite know why.   \n   \nProbably because you feel surrounded by hipocrisy, and straight lines & abrupt shifts are more \"honest\" - if also less interesting. Wedge serifs can be a great compromise.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

They seem somehow both secure and proud.   \n   \nIf it's not too early to indicate specifics: I agree with Grant 'n' Hrant that the curved transition in the 't' doesn't fit and you might want to look at making straight segments here instead. To my eyes the 'e' leans a little right too much.   \n   \nPlease show more as time permits.   \n   \nJon\n\n"

      "content": "HI Kris.   \n   \nNicely done. I've got a slab in the cooker too. I like what you   \nhave started!   \n   \nHere are some thoughts:   \nThe width seems inconsistent to me. The glyph that first drew   \nmy attention was the n. Looks wide. Then maybe the m a little   \ntoo. Maybe the u a hair, b mabe a little narrow. Ok, enough of that!   \n   \nThe bracketing in the top of the t is out of character.   \n   \nKeep an eye on your serifs. Many of them look equal on left and   \nright. This is sometimes best, but often not. Consider your n.   \nPart the width issue is that the inward halfs of the serifs equal   \nthe outer halfs. You can shave the insiders down, maintaing the   \nwhite space and while allowing you to narrow the glyph. Also   \ncheck your v. It's like the n in reverse. The inner halfs can afford   \nto be longer, but the outer halfs need to be as short as you can   \nmanage. Otherwise the spacing will be a nightmare. Some of this   \nwill become more evident as you begin spacing.   \n   \nOld Style Figures:   \nDo they have serifs? Where?   \nDoes a four sit on the baseline?   \nDoes a four descend to the depth of a five? How close?   \nDo the top of the five and seven line up?   \nIs a nine a rotated six?   \n   \nThese are all questions to ask. I think the answers are: it   \ndepends. OSF are a weird animal. Look at a wide gamut of OSF.   \nAttached are 6/9 comparisons for a handfull of fonts. In Caecilia   \nthe 6 is exactly a rotated 9. In other cases, the only adjustment   \nis for ascender descender height (Sauna). Sometimes it is vastly   \ndifferent. It seems the more upright the stance, the less   \nadjusting is needed. All of that said, I think yours look pretty   \ngood. (Maybe snip back the tail on the nine and round out the   \ntail curve a bit more.)   \n   \nMore please!   \n   \nRandy\n\n<!--attachment: 6v9-34295.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*189.1 **6v9%2epdf --><!--attachment: 6v9-34295.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*189.1** 6v9%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417091003im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\"><br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417091003/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6v9-34295.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>6v9.pdf</b></a> (189.1 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n"

If you wish to keep them non-lining someway, I'd reduce the \"short\" ones (0, 1, 2) and adjust the others' position accordingly.
