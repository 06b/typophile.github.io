I can create the image no problem with g.Rasterize(imagexyz), but I don't see anything about adding it to the glyph again.\n\nI'm doing some stuff with PIL, but I can't even get that far until I can add the image to the glyph to trace it.\n\nTrace(imagexyz) does not work. It appears there is a bug with Trace.\n\nrelevant documentation:  \n [http://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/html/Image.xml.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317224059/http:/www.e-font.de/flpydoc/html/Image.xml.html \"http://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/html/Image.xml.html\")  \n [http://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/xml/Glyph.xml](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317224059/http:/www.e-font.de/flpydoc/xml/Glyph.xml \"http://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/xml/Glyph.xml\")\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n",
