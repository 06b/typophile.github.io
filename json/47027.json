I know Sackers Gothic has different weights but apart from that I haven't spotted the difference yet. I don't own either yet.\n\n<cite>Talking about root beer. Does anyone know where I could buy root beer in Europe ? I’ve been searching for years, but no european distributor wants to even touch the stuff :-(</cite>\n\nThere is a fantastic Australian brand called Bundaberg, with very handsome labels, available in the UK. It seems that in Australia they call it by the old-fashioned name sarsaparilla, although it is labelled root beer here. However it looks as if the UK is the only European country they export too. Where are you?\n\n[http://www.bundaberg-brew.com.au](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014124608/http:/www.bundaberg-brew.com.au/)\n\nYou can buy it here!!!!  \n [http://www.sanza.co.uk/apps/shop/products/Bundaberg\\_Root\\_Beer\\_\\_\\_(375ml\\_bottle).asp?pId=7888](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014124608/http:/www.sanza.co.uk/apps/shop/products/Bundaberg_Root_Beer___(375ml_bottle).asp?pId=7888)\n\n"
