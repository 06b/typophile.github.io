The difference is that their solution runs on the web and might be added to Adobe tools - whereas Photofonts have a plug in but as far as I know doesn’t have a web based implementation yet. I am sure Adam will know however...\n\n"

But we will rather have an open-minded vision than a proprietary approach.\n\n"

This might have some very interesting uses, particularly where one wants broad browser support and the ability to limit access to the text.\n\n"

      "content": "Our main goal was to achieve the chaotic aspect of a realistic drawing tool and the emotion of a human handwriting!!! So we skipped the vector approach (loss of detail, greyscales, no color and inappropriate existing tools). We also wanted to have an unlimited number of versions for each letter or ligatures. And since Opentype features programming was also a lot of pain, we went our own way, much easier one ;-)\n\nNow, we can also add specific “behaviors” to fonts and letters (àla kerning pairs, special ligatures replacement, and new ideas too...), that do not exist on current font formats.\n\nWe have developed our own tools not only to work on print projects, but we are also porting the interactive editors to the web. You can try our first demos, so our system can easily be implemented in any existing website (no plugin). For more interactions between type and the user, there will be a much more flexible and playful version too...\n\n"

Rendering text as images via a web server has been around for quite a while.\n\nWhile this is fun, for true web use, it’s not ideal, as image based text just isn’t as accessible...which is a primary benefit of using the web.\n\nThat said, you could improve upon this a bit by making sure that you also render appropriate alt attributes for the images that are created.\n\nAlso, I’m thinking GIF files would likely be a better option for type.\n\nBTW, the hand-rendered typefaces are lovely and I’m sure there’s a market for this.\n\n"
