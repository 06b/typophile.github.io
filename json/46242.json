  "content": "I've been attempting to design an ambigram tattoo for the past couple of years, but I'm never happy with the design. I finally drew this last week based on a typeface I saw and would like some feedback.\n\nIt's supposed to be my mother's maiden name: \"di Noia.\" I'm afraid that I've gotten to the point where I can read the name despite how illegible it may be.\n\nSorry for the bad sketch and copy - I had to scan my sketch on the copy machine in my office. I'm in no way a professional designer, so any tips to improve it would be great. I'm trying to go for an old-fashioned/European/traditional tatoo/almost pirate-like look, hence the blackletter.\n\nThis is in NO WAY a finished piece, obviously; so please don't comment on tracking and such - that stuff will come later! :)\n\nThanks!\n\n-Scott\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020063937im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tattoo%20design%201_5692.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I like the symmetry, thought I didn't quite get it at first. Still, asymmetry is a powerful design principle. It reads to me as \"dio noia.\"\n\nI think that by taking the O out of \"dio\" and letting there be a space would help quite a bit. The open end to the 'o' in noia is a bit confusing. Also, I think it would be nice to see the 'i' in Noia right-side-up.\n\nIt looks good, just tough to read. then again, its a tattoo right? Who else needs to read it?\n\nevan  \n [www.evanmade.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020063937/http:/evanmade.com/)\n\n"

Since it's the centerpiece, that needs to happen if you're insisting on perfect rotational symmetry.\n\nCould experimenting with the flourishes on the the 'N' to look like an 'o' provide a promising direction?\n\n--  \nNick Hladek\n\n"

So I started playing with the negative space a bit.\n\nWhat do you think about this? I think it loses some of its legibility, but I'd like to know if I should continue on this route.\n\n(Actually, now that I see it on the screen, I realize the verticals on the \"N\" need to be thicker)\n\nThanks!\n\n-S\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020063937im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tt1%20copy_6670.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "My thought was the same as Nick's: if the \"o\" becomes attached to the N (as a swashy flourish) and NOT attached to the \"di\" then it _should_ reduce the appearance of an extra unwanted \"o\". The change of style for the \"D\" was to avoid the hassles of trying to make the \"a\" not look like a \"p\"!\n\nKeeping an eye on the legibility is key, unless you want to end up with (wait for it, neologism on its way...) a \"nequigram\" (design that's not readable in either direction): there are enough of those about already.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working.\n\n"

Actually it looks like you copied it right on (great minds think alike)!\n\nI wanted to do something blackletter because I just like the style and the inherent masculine quality of it (I know that's argueable). I like the contrast between sharp point and smooth curves, too.\n\nHmm...looks like I still need to play around a bit.\n\nThanks for the ideas. Please feel free to sketchy and play as much as you want (I know that can be taboo here sometimes).\n\n-S\n\n"
