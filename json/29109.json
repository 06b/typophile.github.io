      "content": "SARTRE cover type+  \nJust a little more info on this face : I believe that it comes from a book published by Gallimard in France in or around 2005. The face makes me think of Garage gothic, which also has this slightly rounded feel. But this particular face is also slightly more angular, for example in the construction of the R, or in the S. I’ve checked the T-26 listing, and there are a couple of slightly similar faces by Jim Marcus (Arete Mono and Tempus gothic), but neither corresponds exactly.  \nthanks again,  \npete\n\n"

Look at the Bold weights set in the letters ‘SARTRE’. The A is a bit different in width, but the overall appearance is quite similar, I think.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
