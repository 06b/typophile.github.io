I checked out your lovely specimen and noticed the Q is very different to the one in this encyclopedia, which has an almost straight tail and looked out of place to me. I'll post an image when I get home.\n\nIs it me or is the comma different between the roman and italic?\n\nDid you start digitising it? I think it's a lovely face.

I have a lowly RDC-7 (3.7 megapixel) but because the macro can go as close as 1cm the effective resolution is over 2000dpi. Here's an example, at about 1700dpi:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4177363425/sizes/o/in/set-7215...](http://web.archive.org/web/20110525052510/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4177363425/sizes/o/in/set-72157622858884157/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4177363425/sizes/o/in/set-72157622858884157/\")\n\nThe edges start getting blurry though.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Had I seen a copy of the Golden Encyclopedia, I would probably have just ignored the typeface, assuming the book to have been in a typeface I never saw before because of being printed in Hungary or somewhere like that to save money.\n\nIt is a beautiful typeface, but I can also understand why it was not successful. The italic looks particularly bad in the absence of any kerning. I would suspect the rights to digitize the face belong to Monotype, and, were they to do so, since a digital version would be properly kerned, the face would have a chance of achieving its potential - basically, as competition to Palatino; an oldstyle typeface comparable to Bembo or Caslon, but with a very modern design sensibility in some areas, such as the serif at the bottom of the lowercase y.\n\nThe fact that it has \"hybrid numerals\" - like those in Microsoft's Georgia - is interesting. I had not known that there were legitimate examples of this; although it's certainly useful in avoiding confusion for modern readers, some people will react to a 1 that doesn't look like an I in non-ranging numerals as an indication of typographic illiteracy - instead of simply a creative and original touch. As I noted in the thread on Al Gore, though, people are familiar with hybrid numerals in typewriter faces.\n\nThus, if hybrid numerals were hybridized a second way - so that while certain digits did extend below the baseline, or above the digit height, they did so by small amounts, and the numeral height was only slightly less than the cap height - then the ranging-style 1 would be perceived as normal.\n\n"

Most of my photos are done with slide film. However my new camera has 15 megapixels and my old 70mm f2.8 Sigma lens can focus at a minimum distance of less than 20cm. The results should be awesome — I haven't had a chance to try it out as I need to buy a memory card tomorrow.\n\nBut here's the previous pic zoomed to 100% on my cheap and nasty 5.1 megapixel Fuji pocketcam.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110525052510im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Magyars_5549.jpg)\n\nSo in terms of rights, would it simply be a matter of contacting Monotype?

Plantin, as your image illustrates, doesn't. So they may have picked it to avoid something confusing to younger readers.\n\nIt could also be, however, that Plantin was simply part of the Golden Books visual identity for some of their covers.\n\nOh, I've just thought of a simpler reason. When Monotype obtained permission to make a version of Spiral, they added an italic. But the accounts of that I've seen never mentioned them adding a **bold**. So, once they decided to use Emerson, but they wanted to begin entries with their names in bold, they had to use another face just to _get_ a bold.\n\n"
