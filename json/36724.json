These are _regular_ women with _normal_ bodies, fer crying out loud!!!\n\nArgh, this is driving me friggin' _NUTS,_ how these marketing leeches and fashion fascists suceed in making women think they are 'big' as soon as they don't look like anorexic boy-girls. Women are _supposed_ to have breast and hips and tummies and butts! That's what makes them beautiful and soft and huggable; that's one of the reasons why we friggin' _love_ them so much! Argh!!!\n\nwheeze wheeze pant pant\n\nSorry people, rant over... Won't happen again. :^/\n\n"

Sorry about the confusion.\n\nI wasn't reacting against this specific website at all but against the global situation which forces this website to market itself like this. It's not the website that's wrong, on the contrary, it is the general perception of the female body in today's hyperconsumerist atmosphere that's totally f\\*\\*\\*ed up. I mean, [Bratz](http://web.archive.org/www.thebratzfilm.com/) anyone?\n\n"
