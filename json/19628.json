  "content": "I, as most mexicans have family working in the United States, so I decided to make this post as a mean to support them asking all north american typophiles to reject and help to stop the HR 4437 bill.\n\nThere are about 41 million hispanic inmigrants working in the united states, doing an honest life trough hard work on duties most north americans are not willing to do. It’s true many of them (about 11 million) reached the United States ilegally, but it is also true that ilegal workers are hired under very unfair conditions like up to 14 or 16 hour working days, not medical or social assitence, unjustified dismissal and very low payments.\n\nTrying to turn this people into criminals is not fair, and is not going to fix the problem, it´s just going to make it worse. A wall in the desert is not going to stop illegal inmigration and treating people like animals (denying medial assitance) is the real crime. There are also some illegal north americans in mexico (many of them in San Miguel de Allende, about 40 km from here), and I can assure you they are well treated.\n\nThe real solution is to have a fair treat for temporal inmigrant workers, because we all know you need the workers and we need the work, this radical position is an hipocresy that only benefits the ones who explode and violate the human rights of workers.\n\n [‹ Book question (McLuhan)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615191344/http:/typophile.com/node/19170 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [need help with names of two fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615191344/http:/typophile.com/node/19757 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Most of the jobs supposedly performed by illegals are service industries, not manufacturing, so they aren’t in direct competition with China. This isn’t about immigration, this is about illegal immigration. We are a nation of immigrants, and anyone is welcome in America as long as they are here legally, obey the laws, pay taxes, etc. Businesses that hire illegals should be fined.

How come more people don’t talk about the individuals, companies, and corporations who pay these immigrants illegally-low wages? That is criminal behavior! **That** should be stopped. In fact, if these crimes would be stopped, the illegal immigration issue might flare-down a bit as well. But no one seems interested in that dialogue. We want to have it both ways as Americans… cheap goods and services, and only legal immigration.\n\nPeople come to the US because they know that they will have a better life. Illegal immigrants know that millions of Americans are willing to pay them under the table.\n\nAs a caveat, it should also be pointed out that the US allows more legal immigrants across its borders than any other nation in the world. But then again, even these people are not treated well. I live as a foreign national in another country, and my situation clearly cannot be compared with that of those who have come from Central America to the US, but I have had a few hurdles of my own to jump through here in Germany. Nevertheless, I feel ashamed when I hear what problems my government back home puts \\*legal\\* immigrants through. In comparison with that, my problems are nothing. Since September 11, it seems as if all immigrants to the US are viewed as potential terrorists, people who would rather tear the country down rather than build it up, in order that they get to have a better life, too. Maybe it would be for the best if we as Americans would totally rethink how we thought about immigration altogether so that we can finally be honest with ourselves again.\n\nJust my opinion.\n\n"

Is the American taxpayer expected to be Mexico’s welfare system, with no limit? As a rule we don’t get the cream of the crop sneaking across the border. There are parts of OC where you can see all these little Mexican baby machines cranking them out as fast as they possibly can. (partly because of the Catholic beliefs on birth-control, I imagine), while all their brood is orbiting them as they cross at the intersections\n\nMeanwhile I can’t seem to get ahead here, even though I am making what some people think is decent money. We can’t afford to buy a house, let alone provide for retirement at my current income levels.\n\nIf there is no limit to letting the poor of Mexico flood into California, then no amount of taxation will ever be enough.\n\nIf the bleeding-hearts are so concerned about the poor Mexicans crossing our border looking for opportunity, they should be ultra-concerned about the Guatemalans, who are even worse off, who are raped, have their money stolen, usually by soldiers or police. Since they have no right to be there, no one cares how they are treated.\n\n[Check this AP news story](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615191344/http:/hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MEXICO_MISTREATING_MIGRANTS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2006-04-18-18-08-31)\n\nVincente Fox’s hypocrisy reaches new levels of irony.\n\nPlease keep in mind I am married to a Mexican citizen who feels much the same way I do, only she is more cynical about the Mexican government. And I love much of the Mexican culture and music. I probably have the biggest collection of trios, rondallas, and female ranchera singers of any white person in California. Lucha Villa, Chelo (Mejor Me Voy, Si Ya Te Vas: Si algun dia las penas de la vida te hacen daño, no pretendas buscarme, etc.), Lola Beltran, Flor Silvestre, Beatriz Adriana (echele ganas) etc. are the part of my music collection I would grab if the house were burning down. Too much effort went into getting them all, and many are out of print.\n\nSo I can say I love Mexicans, I don’t don’t think I should be taken advantage of by the ones who don’t respect our laws.\n\n<cite> There are also some illegal north americans in mexico (many of them in San Miguel de Allende, about 40 km from here), and I can assure you they are well treated.</cite>\n\nFrom my experience, it would only be because they have money. I have family in Mexico, I have traveled in Mexico, and I know how it works. Please don’t paint a picture as if ghetto occupants started sneaking into Mexico and down to San Miguel de Allende, they would be welcome with open arms. I have been in San Miguel. I bought some nice Huichol art there, fortunately before the price started skyrocketing.\n\nThe city is very pretty. And I imagine they want to keep it that way.\n\nAnd another thing, why in the flying blankety-blank shouldn’t we be able to decide our own laws, or enforce the ones we have without extortion from people with no right to be here. The whole thing is ludicrous.\n\nNow to balance my position, I am in favor (as I think is a majority of Americans) of a program that legally allows workers to be here. There is no doubt they make a valuable contribution.\n\nBut not without restrictions or guidelines.\n\nAnd now a story we personally know about. A Mexican women (cousin of a friend of my wife) crossed the border illegally, then started having babies here (now she is at four), so now all the kids are US citizens, and she is getting benefits; Money for a place to stay (using forged Social Security docs) and since the fourth son is deaf, she is given money for special education, and hearing aids. She doesn’t work, because if she did she wouldn’t be elegible for all the benefits.\n\nAnd I could go on for quite a while about things like this, because of the work my wife does. She is trusted by many of them to hear the details of all the stories the working ones have concerning their relatives.\n\nAll courtesy of the unknowing Californian taxpayers.\n\nAnd Ricardo, you make a valid point about my wording which I have amended above.\n\n<cite>Ah, that’s a bit too close to Seattle. Sorry, my offer is off the table. ;-)</cite>\n\nHey, I have asked to be transferred to develop that area for my company. I’ll look you up if it happens.

The process of the fiance visa and adjusting her status after we married to allow her to stay took about a year.

I speak from personal experience when I say that the legal process of immigration takes time and can be filled with anxiety. BUT the process exists for a reason and should be respected. My wife and I were treated with the utmost respect throughout the process by USCIS officials and in the end we were rewarded for following proper procedures.\n\nThe issue of illegal immigration touches my wife and I personally as we followed the rules and waited over two years to be married and together.

It would also redefine undocumented illegal immigrants as felons, and punish anyone guilty of providing them assistance. It also would create several new mandatory minimum penalties for a variety of offenses, including some that would expose humanitarian workers, public schoolteachers, church workers, and others whose only object is to provide relief and aid to five-year mandatory minimum prison sentences.\n\nOn the opposite side of the issue it is argued that living illegally in the United States is a crime, and that this bill merely aims at recementing US immigration codes that have for so long been neglected. Supporters of the bill argue that it will increase border security by providing more US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to the border, thereby helping to curtail any possible entry to the country by terrorists, and that the passage of this bill may help curtail drug trafficking and human trafficking from Mexico to the US by depriving smugglers of sources and contacts on the US side of the border.”\n\n"

We have a kind of sprawling and fairly active border patrol, as far as I can tell, but people come streaming in anyway. They’ll get themselves woven into American society if they want to, and these bits and pieces of legislation won’t end up meaning much. We’re not gonna close our borders in any significant way, and we’re not gonna open them up much either. We’re just gonna keep muddling along. We can pontificate about the supposed obnoxiousness of people marching with Mexican (not American!) flags, or we can pontificate about the ways in which immigrant labor (illegals or not) is an essential part of our economy, so “illegal” must be considered in context. It just doesn’t matter.\n\nMy own “opinion” is that a lot of this brouhaha is election-season politics, nothing more. And another opinion would be that we in America just need to acknowledge we can’t have it both ways: free trade worldwide, but limited circulation of human beings.

It isn’t the motherland that Italy, China, or most Old World countries are. And, unlike other American countries, it has never become one. You can be American, but most Americans are something else as well, be it Italian, German, Dutch, Chinese, or whatever.\n\nAnyway, it’s about time North Americans start learning more than one language. It seems to me that most of the negative feelings towards these people come from simple ignorance. Most Americans don’t speak their language or understand their culture. If you remove yourself a bit and think of the reality, what would it change to allow these immigrants into the US legally and accept Spanish as a de facto official language alongside English in the places they live?

It takes my grandmother 15 minutes to write a birthday card and I don’t think she’s ever read a book besides maybe from a small Missal from when she was a girl that she has by her bed.

Meanwhile, they are better off, no, <cite>much</cite> better off than most native-born Canadians. Why? They worked their asses off and saved every penny, like all immigrants. Immigrants tend to be more driven, ambitious, and successful than most people. Just think: they saw a problem and went to such great lengths to overcome it as moving to a foreign country, learning a new language (or several), finding a place to live and a job all over again, etc...\n\nWould you have the wherewithal to do something like that? I don’t mean moving to a new country because you can afford to do something new (my grandparents had to raise and sell a runt pig their neighbor gave them to afford the ticket to come here), but overcoming your conditions to do it. Acknowledge that in business, there are many entrepreneurs who never had much schooling but who had an idea that made them very rich.\n\nNext, acknowedge that the rich pay more taxes.\n\n"
