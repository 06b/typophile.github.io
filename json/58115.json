  "content": "Hello All,\n\nJust a quick question, are the 'ODEON' fonts (ODEON headline and ODEON lette gothic) the same as ITC Machine and Letter gotic. I e-mailed the company and recieved the following reply:\n\nDear Mr Storey,\n\nThank you for your subsequent email. The font used in the ODEON sign is not a commercially available font. It is a unique font owned exclusively by ODEON and is used in all of our designs and most importantly forms our ODEON logo. We actually use 2 different fonts:\n\nODEON Headline - This is the most recognisable font and is used in our name signs. It only has capital letters.\n\nODEON Letter Gothic - This is our secondary font and is used in sub-headings, etc. Again, it only has capital letters.\n\nWe hope that this answers your questions.\n\nYours\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease find the images they sent me as well.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019160616im_/http:/typophile.com/files/headline_4896.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019160616im_/http:/typophile.com/files/letter_g_4488.gif)\n\n",
