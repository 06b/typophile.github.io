      "content": "I take it you are looking for a fairly standard Roman letter, rather than Bible style blackletter or scripts. Anyway, you already have one script on the page. Something that looks reassuring without a lot of harsh threatening angles and that might even be seen as \"inspirational.\"  \nIf you really want to limit your choices to free, you might as well get something that's well made. A good prospect is Calluna by Jos Buivenga at exljbris. The regular weight is currently available free from Myfonts. [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723192037/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/\")  \nBTW white on black for this topic suggests a funeral. Why not something in a cheerful pastel?  \nDon\n\n"
