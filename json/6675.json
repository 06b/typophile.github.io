  "content": "A weird thing--If I select Fournier Expert, or Minion Expert, in Quark 6, or in Font Book, or Suitcase X1, it doesn't display anything except the fractions. But I can see all of the characters in InDesign CS.   \nJust did a set of book galleys where I used Expert for the ligatures, and I couldn't see any of them, even though they print out fine.   \nUsing Mac OS 10.3.5. Any body else have this problem, or know what to do about it?   \n   \nRelated questions: TypeTool shows them, but if I try to type them in the TypeTool metrics window, the fractions & ligs are not on the same keys that they are when I type them in a layout program.\n\n",
