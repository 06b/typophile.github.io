      "content": "Congratulations to Kris!\n\nI prefer National to other recent types I have seen that aim at reviving the flavor of 19th century English and American grotesques. The others are often too quirky looking to my eyes. National has the human feel and charm of the old grotesques, with more balance. Franklin Gothic, also a regularization of 19th century grotesques, is also not quirky and is well balanced, but is more formal. So National offers a contemporary, alternative with a nice charm and balance.\n\n"

      "content": "Major props, Kris, a huge achievement.  \nAnd congratulations to Chester Jenkins and Village as well, for the \"big league\" vision of what a typeface can be, in the styles, weights, features and languages that it supports.  \nDoes National represent the Village encoding standard?  \nI note that H&FJ have an encoding standard, Latin-X™.  \nIt seems that with the graphic elements, National could be WGL4, with Cyrillic and Greek added.\n\nSome observations:\n\n19th-century flavour, certainly, but two some distinction:  \n1. The capitals are small and light compared to the older sans faces: if National's caps were increased in size to ascender height, that height conformity, and the added weight contrast with lower case it would create, would be more like a 19C sans. In this respect, National follows the \"Helvetica\" paradigm of a smoothing out of cap/lc contrast.  \n2. The tailed \"l\" is, AFAIK, a 20th-century trend in sans faces. Interestingly, its curvyness harmonizes well with the rounded forms in National's \"geometric\" stylistic alternate, where one might have supposed that a straight l would be more minimally geo.\n\nWith regards to the stylistic alternate included: I wonder at what point a separate style emerges, both from a categorical perspective, and from a product perspective. Recently, Neutra has been extended to create Neutra 2, by changing a few characters. yet Hypatia and National, for instance, incorporate the alternate face as a Stylistic Set (or so I deduce from the National PDF) within one typeface, with the grotesque as the default and the geometric as the alternate.\n\n"

I know Chester has an extensive encoding for his own work, and that is being added to & refined. I basically use whatever is his latest.\n\n<cite>1. The capitals are small and light compared to the older sans…more like a 19C sans</cite>\n\nYeah, some interesting observations there. The National blurb says it \"travels through, and touches on, a lot of historical material, it is designed to thrive in our modern typographic climate.\" I really wanted a sans that was relatively contemporary, not a slavish revival, with anachronisms like enormous, dark capitals. That might also explain the 'l' tail as well!\n\n<cite>But why separate OT fonts for small caps?</cite>\n\nEverything is in one font file, believe me! As a user, I cannot stand to have separate font files. I think Chester has done this to show that there are small caps for all styles.\n\n<cite>Yeah, esp considering the Dollar is at an alltime low vs the Euro ; ). 250 USD = 173 EUR.</cite>\n\nI quite like the quip at the top of the vllg.com site that says \"our dollar is weak but our types are strong!\".\n\n<cite>Best thing from NZ since the Chills. Well done!</cite>\n\nWoah! That is an enormous compliment Fredrik—not too sure if it is entirely justified, but thanks all the same!\n\n"

I was testing this baby from before it even had a percent glyph, kerning, rounded punctuation or even the subtle ink traps. It seems strange how a typeface can grow like that.\n\nI think the first thing to draw me to National was the extra bold weights, I thought they were slightly mad. I loved using the heaver weights in titles, headings and as such (and I loved how the tail of the lowercase 'a' remains from book to extra bold).  \nSo I loved using National in larger text settings.\n\nBut now I'm appreciating the regular weights a lot more, National hides really well in longer text, but still has that warmth in the character to make the read interesting.  \nIt works better in text than I thought it could.\n\nSo its become my studios little work horse. Always does its job as long as you treat it well (correct line length, 'actual' superiors nice rag and so on...), so look after it!\n\nGood stuff Sowersby, make some more cool type!
