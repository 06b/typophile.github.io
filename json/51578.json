  "content": "From what I have read about breaking the rules/ abandoning the grid, Im not sure it is completely possible to escape. Discussions of the designer being, well you could say, unleashed from the grid to result in a more creative and unconstrained piece of design. Though I have noticed, if not a grid then a form of structure/control is needed and used , to produce a functional piece of design. So is the grid really being broken or just recreated into another form?\n\n",

There is always something unheard or unseen there if it is only your mind trying to impose order.\n\nWith design, something more free-form creates a tension where the viewer is compelled to try and understand an order. If you don't want this tension/distraction you can nail everything down in a predictable way. Even in a New York School painting you may find a dash of color placed in a position that tips the hat to formal geometric composition.\n\n"
