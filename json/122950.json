      "content": "Sorry, but I don't think it works well as a logo. Far too many elements, and when reduced to a small size (which logos often are) it becomes illegible.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317183227im_/http:/typophile.com/files/combined_5762.jpg)\n\nMy suggestion would be to greatly simplify it, have one image instead of multiple images (perhaps stacking them would suggest multiple signs without actually showing them), and perhaps break the long name into 2 lines which would allow you to make the type larger. And I wouldn't make the small tag line part of the logo itself. (Also I'm not sure what the red sign with 3 horizontal lines means, but perhaps that image is well known in the UK.)\n\nCertainly you can show multiple signs in an advertisement, but don't try to do that in the logo itself.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi James\n\nGreat feedback. I already thought about this and although I can take the elements out when the logo is minimised I felt I needed / wanted them for when the logo was enlarged.\n\nI've printed out a sample business card to see what it looks like and so far i'm happy, i've gone for a more bold text, lost the spaces and narrowed the spacing between the letters, very much like my second example.\n\n"

      "content": "Having 2 different versions of your logo is usually not a good idea, but it's your decision. Create both versions at the same time and make sure the small version is readable in tiny sizes.\n\nKeep in mind that you don't always control the size of your logo. If you contribute to a local charity event, your logo might appear (along with others) in a tiny size on their printed materials. This happened to one of my clients (I didn't design the logo) and it was illegible.\n\nYou'll also need black-and-white versions. They aren't needed very often these days, but are useful for items distributed by photocopies, faxes, etc.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree completely with James. It's entirely too complicated and does not scale well at all.\n\nA logo should be an easily apprehended symbol. It should not be something that you need to inspect to understand or absorb. Look at every well known logo that you can think of, that stands out as strong and effective, and you'll see an iconic quality.\n\nThe specific symbols you incorporate are also a bit mystifying, such as the umbrella and the \"tile\" in the forefront, which is not recognizable as anything at all until you've puzzled out that it's a printed page. Together it seems like a random collection of \"stuff we print\", but requires too much work on the viewer's part to come to that conclusion.\n\nThe bolder type certainly works better. I would also make it so that the logotype design is not dependent on the inclusion of \"Print, Signage, and Corporate Merchandise\" as that is more of tagline, and again at small scale it's going to be rendered illegible.\n\n"
