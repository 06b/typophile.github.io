After missing Hal’s class during TypeCon I am thrilled to be getting my hands inky and learning a few basic moves. These images were taken last night during our class. Thanks again Hal.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/8_6493.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/6_5246.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/7_4832.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/5_6260.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1_6577.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/10_5325.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/11_5362.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3_5299.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/12_4845.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/9_3779.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423160523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/4_4187.jpg)\n\n",
