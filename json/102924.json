  "content": "Hey all,\n\nDoes anyone have any info on what the legal protocol would be if one wanted to design a typeface that was inspired by a logotype of a company, organization, or sports team? If the logotypes were designed somewhere in the 1940s or 1950s and still in use today. And particular letters of the font would attempt to match exactly the letters in the logotype. This font could be used as an accompanying character set to the letters already in the logotype.\n\nThanks for any info!\n\n",
