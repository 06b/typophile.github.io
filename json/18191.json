The \"Dalit\" are the untouchables from India that are below the caste system, and this organization is lobbying for their freedom.\n\nThis is what I have been playing with... I'd appreciate your thoughts and feedback.\n\nThanks,  \nJesse\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018232332im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dalitnetwork.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "The top one seems a little better, however, there is something strange about the space between first D and the chain, maybe offsetting chain lower could help…As is, I read it more as “Calit” with “C” inverted on purpose, so you have to improve the readability of “D”. Also, as your tracking is pretty tight, the area between “ali” becomes a little problematic.\n\n"

      "content": "Jesse,\n\nI like what you did with “D” in the top one, but spacing of the chain still needs work. Tracking is much better now. Putting the chain in the negative space makes it look like a bit heavy and has a mechanical feel to it. Overall, even in the positive space, the chain feels a little on the heavy side, but I know you want to keep the same thinness as the type…Keep pushing it a bit further…what do other people think ?\n\nJen\n\n"

If you do have the broken-chain angled the way you currently have it, I suggest use it reversed out. I think your negative space mock-ups aren't bad. Maybe shorten the d and get rid of the small stem.\n\nI also think a dark orange would be a good color for the chain, since orange is a national color. Maybe a warm grey for the type.\n\nThe space between the \"i\" and the \"t\" bothers me.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018232332im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dal.gif)\n\n"
