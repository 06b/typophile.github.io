It was designed by Werner Schneider (he designed Schneider Antiqua for Berthold) and is used for the Underground and other public transportation in Munich. Even Vienna uses Vialog for signage.   \nAll the Vialog fonts are part of the Platinum Collection at Linotype. The special set of signage symbols and arrows is online at [www.linotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526221758/http:/www.linotype.com/).   \nThe pi-fonts are used by different other public transportation systems.   \nEven Pfizer Medicals Germany uses Vialog for their house style.   \nEnclosed the PDF with all the Vialog signs. Great for signage.   \nHenk\n\n"
