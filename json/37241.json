  "content": "Hi\n\nI've been asked to create a logo for a mate, his company sells in-game advertising and is called 'game creative'.\n\nThe idea is that the logo represents the essential building blocks of all games i.e. pixels. So I'm looking for a face that has a pixel look or is very square and gridlike.\n\nI tried ff stealth and gridnik but neither seem right for this. Can anyone suggest anything else?\n\nThanks\n\n",
