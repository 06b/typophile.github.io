  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nUpcoming days, I'll be working on the design of a dissertation. A friend of mine is becoming a real doctor. In these collection of scientific articles, which, all together, form the body of the dissertation, lots & lots of abbrevations are used, in various kinds. For example:\n\nprotein S, protein A, type III, PS antigen, VTE, ATE, acronyms like 'DESCARTES'.\n\nFor me, it's all mambojambo, but I wanted to be clear and straightforward and set all these abbrevations in (spaced) small caps.  \nThat's quite a tough job of typographic handwork but I think it's necessary, or at least the best solution.\n\nAm I right with this?\n\n",

We can squabble over particular instances, but should be able to agree on the principle. In passing, the purpose they serve is not \"obeying a rule,\" or \"banishing ugliness.\"\n\nI'm afraid book interior design is really a trade, not an art.

      "content": "\\> Why does everyone hate caps so much?\n\nThe problem with full cap acronyms is that they alter the visual color of the page. Like bold type, or lining numerals, they make little blobs of heavy ink usage on the page. These can impede reading ... the eye is drawn to the heavy area, breaking away from where it was, and then must fight its way back.\n\nThat is the real reason why typographers use small cap acronyms, old style figures, and italic instead of bold for emphasis, with the exception of books designed to make the eye jump to certain locations (dictionaries and key words in a textbook, as examples).\n\nSome people say they use them because they like the look of them, or that they are different. For me that isn't enough.\n\nA single letter in full caps is not a problem, except that of consistency. I always had problems with US when dealing in small caps, as it looks like the word us went set in SC. I always tried to get editor's permission to use USA instead.\n\n"

After a period (phototype and early digital) when small caps were practically non-existent and sorely missed, suddenly now the pendulum seems to have swung the other way.\n\nSeems like everyone wants to apply small caps whenever capitals are removed from lowercase. Small caps have become some badge of typographic sophistication, and who doesn't want to be sophisticated? The more you use, the more sophisticated you are, right?\n\n<cite> &gt; Setting, for example, DESCARTES in small caps and leaving the roman numerals for what they are, isn’t that just an unmotivated, arbitrary choice?</cite>\n\nI suppose one might think so. But if setting a long acronym in small caps, in order to prevent a dark reading distraction in the text, causes one to also set roman numerals in small caps, wherein they become momentarily confusing to the reader and unclear as roman numerals . . . then I would suggest that (paraphrasing Emerson) \"a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little caps.\"\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>In phototype setting times (no small caps available) it was common to set full cap acronyms half a point smaller.</cite>\n\nInteresting observation. My experience (back to 1980 anyway) runs the other way, in phototype setting times, designer's dealing with extended text would choose a font that had small caps available. Sort of an extension of the thinking from hot metal; most type shops would have four or five or even six type families appropriate for setting extended text, and the designer would choose from those.\n\nI suppose advertising design and composition might have been different.\n\nWhich maybe points up the range of responses in this thread. Type designers tend to think in theoretical terms, where the only theory at play is typographic theory.\n\nType users split into at least two groups. One is broadly termed ephemeral printing, where the display type may be most important and chosen first. Usually the amount of text is so small that manipulation of characters or their setting is not a problem. Another group would be book typography, which has different expectations about a reader (including how many hours he/she has to spend with the text). I suppose today another would be the use of type on the web, and for all I know, that breaks into multiple uses as well.\n\nSounding my overused trumpet yet again, The purpose of almost all type is for communication, usually in the form of reading, not hanging on a museum wall. Once you agree on that point, how you view an audience becomes a key concept. And how the (graphic) designer treats that audience is equally key; rarely is it correct for the designer to further their agenda. To do so moves you back toward \"audience\" in an artistic context; a work hanging on a museum wall.\n\n"
