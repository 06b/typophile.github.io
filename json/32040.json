Athough the symbol on the middle of the  \nsecond line looks like a U, the vertical strokes seem to me to  \nbe too close together; I thought it might be a commercial sign  \nlike the “per” symbol (unicode U-214C).\n\nI’d be most grateful if anyone could tell me more about it.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nJim\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [para-U.jpeg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070309183719/http:/typophile.com/files/para-U.jpeg) | 93.41 KB |\n| [char-U.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20070309183719/http:/typophile.com/files/char-U.png) | 55.6 KB |\n\n",
