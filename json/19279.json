All major search engines make use of link analysis and thus can be impacted. So, a search for “miserable failure” on June 1, 2005 brought up the official George W. Bush biography number one on Google, Yahoo and MSN and number two on Ask Jeeves. On June 2, 2005, Yooter reported that George Bush is now ranked first for the keyword ’failure’ as well as ’miserable failure’ in both Google and Yahoo.\n\n"
