Usually, the ideas lay dormant in some hidden file for that reason, having little chance to see the light of the day. But sometimes I want to release the baby for I feel that it would be rather a pitty to ‘keep it imprisoned’. So I decided to [release Lindau now](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415041954/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lindau/), although it is such a “lonely child”. It may be of some usefulness, anyway.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415041954im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schild_Lindau_5_T_6523.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415041954im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schild_Lindau_4_T_6404.png)\n\n",
