  "content": "I've been looking for a Scotch for some time to be my all-around workhouse face, but I haven't been able to choose between Miller, Chronicle, and Ingeborg. I need something that would look good at 11 or 12 pt.\n\nHere are my thoughts: Miller is absolutely lovely to me, great numerals, great italic, great punctuation, but had the ill fortune of being born too soon (pre-Opentype era), so it has certain lacks. Chronicle is executed amazingly, but comes off--to my eyes, anyway--almost over-refined (and bland in comparison with Miller). Ingeborg is intriguing, but I haven't seen it in print anywhere (and it's the most expensive).\n\nAdvice?\n\n",

Here is a screen grab.  \nThe default vertical metrics set solid, which may not be to everyone's taste, but it struck me as the right thing to do.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175154im_/http:/typophile.com/files/grab_6352.png)\n\nA 160-page [specimen book](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175154/http:/shinntype.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=40&products_id=391) is available.\n\n"

      "content": "Ingeborg is _not_ a Scotch Roman. It is, however, an absolutely splendid typeface, and I'd buy it anyway if I were you.\n\nIf you are absolutely set on having a Scotch Roman, then Nick's Scotch Modern is one of the most authentic. I think of Miller and Chronicle more as ‘inspired-by’ than true Scotches (H&FJ describe Chronicle, amusingly, as a ‘blendid Scotch’): they update the style for contemporary tastes, notably in reducing the stroke contrast. They're both very nice types, and Miller is largely responsible for reviving interest in the genre, but whether it is appropriate depends on how much you want to evoke the full on spiky look of a page of Victorian typesetting.\n\n[Nick, I think you should market Scotch Modern as ‘The single malt of Scotch Romans’.]\n\n"

(And cite James Mosley for precedent, in _A Tally of Types_).\n\n"

D. Farmer & Sons in 1903.\n\nLater adaptations blended with other modern strains and dropped the \"Roman.\" Another branch fed into designs like Century and Caledonia.\n\nThe nomenclature and taxonomy are a bit confusing.\n\n"
