I am grateful if you know of something close that I can cobble together a few words for a new project that is due soon. Disregard the cap \"P\" and \"B\" open stems if they aren't in your findings.

Its lower case a's and e's still aren't exactly right, but it is the closest font going! This should at least get me through comping up new designs for presentation.  \nThanks again!\n\n"
