It attains the very definition of deluxe by conjoining the classic thin-and-thick script treatment with thin-only counterpart strokes, then it goes the extra mile with a varied complement of overlaid flourishes. The usual assortment of multiple alternates and ending forms pushes it even further in class and versatility.\n\nMonograms, logos, jewelry packaging and book covers are only a few of the possibilities with such a high-end script.\n\nVisit our gallery called \"The Art Room\" at [http://bit.ly/11hRyvx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414141307/http:/bit.ly/11hRyvx \"http://bit.ly/11hRyvx\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414141307im_/http:/typophile.com/files/400_4253.png)\n\nTypeface design: Angel Koziupa & Ale Paul for **[Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414141307/http:/www.sudtipos.com/)**.  \nLicense the typeface with a Lted.
