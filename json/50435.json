  "content": "I’m doing a logo for a new business called Brogan Brothers, which will make cabinets and also do general remodeling, to clients making over $200,000 a year. I’ve found an interesting relationship with an italicized upper case B, and a lower case B.  \nThis is in my opinion, the best rough I’ve come up with for the client, based on their elite audience. Now, the client’s spouse thought that the use of an Upper and Lower case B in the logo “suggests that one Brogan is far more important than the other Brogan.”  \nYet, I feel that since the name of the company is not “Brogan & Brogan,” but rather, “Brogan Brothers,” this argument does not hold weight. Furthermore, I’m going to use the font Disturbance with this logo, based on its rhythm and upper&lowercase within the same alphabet.\n\nI’ld like to be able to show some references to the client of other logos that use acronyms, and an upper and lower case version of the same letter. Any links, posts, or suggestions would be helpful.\n\nThankyou!\n\nhere’s an alternate link if my attached file doesn’t work:  \n [http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual\\_file.asp?individual\\_id=212054&...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081016094910/http:/www.coroflot.com/public/individual_file.asp?individual_id=212054&portfolio_id=1619410&sort_by=1& \"http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual\\_file.asp?individual\\_id=212054&portfolio\\_id=1619410&sort\\_by=1&\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [BBdisturbance.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081016094910/http:/typophile.com/files/BBdisturbance.jpg) | 29.2 KB |\n\n [‹ MonoSpaced type usage.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081016094910/http:/typophile.com/node/50428 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Didone typeface suggestions ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081016094910/http:/typophile.com/node/50284 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
