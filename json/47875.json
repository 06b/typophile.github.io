  "content": "I'm a designer who knows that I need a lot of help improving my type skills. Will you me give some valuable critiques on which typographic version you prefer and what I could do to improve either? At this point, I'm only concerned about the actual letterforms, not any icons or anything else.  \nI'm concerned that the top version of Canopa feels a little too techy with the \"n\" with no tail, and I thought the capital \"n\" felt too... default all caps.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020195224im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture10_4239.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [canopa\\_n.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020195224/http:/typophile.com/files/canopa_n.pdf) | 47.57 KB |\n\n",

I'd prefer to have this critiqued as though it was a font (albeit a limited quantity of letters) so I can improve letter drawing.\n\n"

      "content": "I do like the lower one. The tail adds a bit of flair.  \nBut since it has no purpose, I would loose it too.\n\nBoth are not techy, this probaly due to the spacing between the letters.  \nIt has a basic feel to me.\n\nRounding the corners is a good comment.\n\nLooks like kerning is slightly off between AN.\n\nNice type!\n\n"
