  "content": "That was the roughly (not verbatim) the topic of my thesis. I wanted to explore the connection between the information designer and the audience, how the information is presented by the designer, how it is perceived by the audience, and who is responsible when the information is misunderstood. That was the written part. For the visual part, I selected a college campus (my old undergraduate university) and redesigned their map and wayfinding/signage system.\n\nI decided to pick it up last night and reread it, almost 2 years later. Afterwards, I began to realize that despite my thesis committee kicking my butt with a plethora of revisions and pushing me to make this a great finishing stroke on my graduate school career, I only scratched the surface and maybe went a bit under. What I want to do is revisit my written part of the project in more depth as well as my visual part of the project. For my resources (and like a complete dolt I left my thesis at home and now I’m in a coffee shop doing a bit of research) I used Tufte, Ferdinand De Sassure, DAvid Crow, Saul Wurner, Nathan Shedroff, Josef Albers, multiple essays on information design from various authors in the last 200 years or so, explored semiotics, cognitive thinking, etc. There are a few others that I’m simply forgetting to mention.\n\nAny suggestions on additional resources that I could use to expand on my thesis?\n\n [‹ ITC Franklin?

If you suppose that “meaning” is something that a writer/designer _puts into_ their work, then when the communication fails, the writer/designer can (and often does) blame readers for the lapse. That’s the predominant approach in the circles with which I’m acquainted; it provides fuel for many of the furies in humanities departments, and it undergirds many conflicts over interpretation in more casual settings.\n\nYou might also think of “meaning” as the stakes of a venture, a wager, whereby the writer/designer proffers a certain expression (in words and images). If careful composition, astute knowledge of the audience, and general luck favor the writer/designer, the communication succeeds. If the writer/designer hasn’t done their homework, or if some unforeseeable circumstance confuses the audience, the communication fails. This model doesn’t depend on the myth of subsistent meaning (the notion that “meaning” soehow inhabits words and images apart from somebody actively apprehending meaning), and keeps the onus for success on the communicator — though even the most careful articulate, precise communicator sometimes doesn’t succeed.\n\n(Singluar “they” deliberate; kindly leash the dogs of grammar enforcement.)\n\n"

Ogden and I. A. Richards. A point they make is that communication through language (or symbols) is a triangular operation, involving a referrer, a referrent and a referee: that is, some **one** is thinking of some **thing** and wishes to convey that thought to some **one else**. With language, metaphor (or simile) is the tool most often used to perform this process, and I would venture to say that “Information Design” depends to a large extent on visual metaphors. How successful either process is depends largely on the strength—that is, lack of ambiguity—of the metaphor.\n\n"
