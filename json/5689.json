Whenever I contribute money to a cause (other than buying candybars from my neighbors children), I need to feel confident that the money is going to an organization that knows money and how to use it. This almost calls for a banklike look.   \n   \nRepresent children/playgrounds, yes, but the purpose of this mark seems to be to promote contribution. Consider stability, professionalism, generocity and community first, then take a stab at the children/playgrounds.   \n   \nTechnically, these marks look like very rough computer generated illustrations. Is that intentional? It doesn't seem appropriate IMO.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

      "content": "\"Formal/refined...for a playground? Yes, one of the primary uses will be to solicit funds, but how do you make the leap to formal?\"   \n   \nBecause you're asking for money. The first marks appeared to be targetted at kids. I assume you're asking money from adults. Perhaps 'formal' was the wrong term...maybe more 'adult' is what I'm going for.   \n   \nIt can still be (and probably should be) fun, but it shouldn't be childish.   \n   \nNow that I've read the rest of the threads, I see others have said that better than I had. ;o)   \n   \n\" Why does their logo work so well?\"   \n   \nI don't think it does. It's fairly generic. The name is interesting, but, again, kind of vague. A good logo isn't always necessary if they have a good product, of course.   \n   \nAnyways, think 'fundraiser' more than 'playground'. It's first and foremost a fundraiser FOR a playground.   \n   \n\"What about the simplicity here: \"   \n   \nThat's better, but still much more of an illustration than a logo. You need to distill that down much more. Consider sun, slide, flower. Try and combine those in more abstract/simplified forms.   \n   \nAlso, you don't need to use kids handwriting. Too obvious. ;o)   \n   \nFinally, consider concepts like 'growth', 'nurture', 'empower', etc.\n\n"

It now looks like you are trying to solicit corporate sponsorship rather than just get all the parents to donate a few bucks here and there. I'm wondering, will this logo just be used for the fundraising aspect of the project, or will it also carry on -perhaps as signage on the finished playground? If the later, I'd like to see you incorporate some for the playfulness of your earlier designs with this recent go-a-round. Maybe it's something as simple as the fern looking like it was drawn by a child using finger paints. Or maybe instead of a fern the icon could be a swing (or other such item) What is most important for this project \"Fernbank\" or \"playground\"?   \nGood work, keep going.\n\n"
