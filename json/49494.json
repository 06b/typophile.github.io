I wanted to use the Iconian font's \"Disco Deck\" as a basis, but it wasn't covering all my needs and desires, so I decided to modify it to suit what I had in mind. Here is the result. The personal, non-commercial use of my font is free. The use of my fonts for commercial and profit purposes is prohibited, unless a small donation is send to me.
