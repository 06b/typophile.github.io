  "content": "Hi everybody\n\nWould love some input into choosing a san serif headline font for a business/lifestyle magazine. Aimed at well-heeled 20-45yo's, want something that is modern, clean, sophisticated but ever-so-slightly groovy. Can this be possible! Something along the lines of Stalemate (which I love) but more serious. Suggestions welcome!!\n\nThanks\n\n",
