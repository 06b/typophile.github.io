  "content": "Is it possible to add more hyphenation dictionaries to InD? I like to test type in foreign languages but Adobe does not supply all of the. They have Library files such as “rus.hyp” which I assume do the trick. Are there others available and if so where? Is it possible to just drop a new “.hyp” file in the library and have that language supported and show up in the InD “Language” pop-up?\n\nChrisL\n\n [‹ TransType Pro Bug?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806231117/http:/typophile.com/node/9796 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fontlab 5, multiple family styles Open Type or Type 1 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806231117/http:/typophile.com/node/20460 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
