Maybe \"Grammarphile\" would be a better name for this place, since so much talk of non-cast letters going on here : )\n\nThis thread, though, definitely belongs at in some kind of philology website. But would that be called \"philogyphile\", \"logyphile\", or simple \"philology\"?--since \"Philology\" itself means \"love of words.\"\n\n"
