I had looked at Tufte’s books online and was impressed, although because my browser is playing up I couldn’t view the pages.  \nI might get a couple of Tufte’s books to start with — “Envisioning Information”, and one other; any recommendations on the second book, given my specific requirments?\n\nSihep  \nThanks as well. I have previously read the Infomation Design Journal and I know one or two of the staff at Reading Uni’s Typo department, but I must of completley missed the website. I have a leaflet for John Benjamin Publishing advertising Rune Pettersson’s Introduction to Information Design — do you have this book? I wonder whether it discusses the philosophies of information design, or is a techinical manual — the second would be preferable.\n\nPS love the photos on Flickr, really beautiful.\n\n"
