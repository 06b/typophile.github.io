      "content": "The widest wide-format printer I've worked with myself was one that could print directly onto vinyl or paper rolls 6ft wide. If I had to print billboard-sized jobs I'd probably have to print it in strips and assemble it on site. But now I've heard of grand-format printers that can print on media 16ft wide. Our jobs cost hundreds of dollars. Something that needs to be that big probably costs thousands.\n\n"

      "content": "The large format printers are solvent based inkjet printers. The solvent ink bonds to the vinyl. The largest machines print billboards as a single piece on a heavy vinyl banner material. The banner is stretched around the framework of the sign.The newest thing is large scale LED billboards that light and are changeable similar to the rotators. Rotators are slats covered in adhesive vinyl, also digitally printed. The same material is used for vehicle wraps.\n\nMy wife gets a kick out of rotators being stuck or out of sink so that part is one message and the other part is another machine.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[_...from the Fontry_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150224191229/http:/www.thefontry.com/)\n\n"
