  "content": "This new screen-based keyboard is ingenius. It’s fully contextual for each application, but more importantly allows the user to set the language on the fly, as there is a small screen behind every key. Curious what you multi-lingual designers think of this. It doesn’t hurt that it’s beautiful.\n\nAs an observation, it’s interesting that this came from a Russian firm where they’re probably tired of a Latin-centric QWERTY world.\n\nI wonder what the possibilities are for languages like Chinese with enormous character sets.\n\n[http://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060504203151/http:/www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/)\n\nThanks Jen Panasik for the link.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [psd.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060504203151/http:/typophile.com/files/psd.jpg) | 33.44 KB |\n\n",
