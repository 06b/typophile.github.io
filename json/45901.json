      "content": "The b and p with the slight open space in the bowl is the most interesting part, It makes it work really well at small sizes. If you plan on turning this into a full family, you might want to make a Display weight with closed bowls for these characters. The top of the q's stem seems a bit too thin, there might be a better way to resolve this than having a stem extending up. Although I think the z on its own is pretty cool, it might be a bit too unique for this typeface. Overall, it has a really nice texture, even though the kerning isn't quite there (which means this typeface has even more potential!)\n\n"
