Not really available at the moment, see [this older thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222005523/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20844).  \n#2 is Pistilli Roman by [John Pistilli](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222005523/http:/typophile.com/wiki/John%2520Pistilli). Also not available anymore, [see this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222005523/http:/www.typophile.com/node/2156). Thereâ€™s a new version by [Jason Walcott](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222005523/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jason%2520Walcott), named [Eloquent](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222005523/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000118#specimen).\n\nFor alternatives, see this [FontList of Extra Bold Didones](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222005523/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/didone_extra_bold/). [Ingeborg Fat](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222005523/http:/www.typejockeys.com/type/6_Ingeborg) by [Michael Hochleitner](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222005523/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Michael%2520Hochleitner) is a marvellous fresh option with accompanying italics; it has a few swash cap alternates and all the other bells and whistles you could wish for.  \nF\n\n"
