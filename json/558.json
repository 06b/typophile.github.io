I started a new thread because I don't want to talk about Caslon, and because I figured it would be easier to keep track of just how long it takes for Hrant and Gerald G. to get into a pissing match ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918021333im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nA couple of observations on 'optical scaling':   \n   \nFirstly, I don't think it is a very good term, although better than the common 'optical sizes'. What we're talking about is _different fonts_, which was obvious in the days of metal type, but ceased to be obvious with the advent of phototype, when any font could be scaled to any size (within the limits of the particular typesetting technology). Adobe's Multiple Master and similar interpolation or extrapolation technologies confuse things further, by offering the possibility of manipulating outlines in a single font at the same time as scaling. Now, with the demise of MM fonts, we're back where we were, and where I think we should be: optical scaling means different fonts.   \n   \nSecondly, the value of interpolation -- which is still a useful tool in font making, even though it has, at least for now, disappeared from font formats -- is very limited in making fonts that are optimised for reading at different sizes. At the Linotype Typotechnica conference in Heidelberg, last February, I met Karl-Christian Lege from K\n\n",

In ITC Bodoni, what is fabulous, is the incredible difference between the narrow delicate 72, and the 6 large \"Clarendon style effect\" Bodoni 6.   \n   \nInterpolation is good for such task, but only if the two masters are really good in term of design. FB fonts generally propose good variations in this area, despite you can't completely agree with the style of the typefaces to which they applied the Optical scaling.\n\n"

One could indeed argue that _some_ features in _some_ fonts cannot be adequately interpolated merely through Cartesian transformation\\*, but that's about it. When you consider the elements needed to deviate the smaller sizes from the \"deliberative ideal\", you realize that they can be interpolated just fine (although certainly not linearly wrt point size). Furthermore, it's a matter of quality, not absolutes. For example, you could say that the optical scaling in the Adobe fonts is weak, but it's still there.   \n   \n\\* See my Founders Caslon elaboration (June 20) here:   \n [http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/12111.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918021333/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/12111.html)   \n   \nThe Lege project seems interesting. However, interpolating [linearly] between 6 and 9 will not work very well, because 6 is below the immersive reading threshold and 9 is above. If you look at the 6 versus 8 versus 10 point of ATF Garamond for example, you'll see that in the 6 the descenders get abruptly much shorter. My theory is that they wanted to give more room to the caps, since the very small sizes are more often used for all-caps.   \n   \n--   \n   \nIn my case, I'd love to formulate my own rules from scratch as to what needs to happen when sizes get small, but of course one can save a lot of effort by looking at existing/past practice. The ITC Bodoni stuff is nice, but in looking carefully at what different font houses have done from the very beginning, ATF stands out. There are many clues to this (such as their determination that 40 point -an odd size- is the upper limit for compensation), but their mastery is most obvious in ATF Garamond, as compared even to the glorious Imprimerie Nationale Garamont. My guess is they became experts motivated by their engineering background, but always using human vision (not geometry) as the guide.   \n   \nTo this effect, I'm working on printing a waterfall of 10 sizes of ATF Garamond, and will be doing some numerical analysis on the results.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Being non-scalar (incemental) for weight/condensing, Multiple Master typefaces lacked personality, a fault recognized by the addition, later in the game, of extra \"master instances\" between the ends of the spectrum.   \n   \nPrinting used to be highly conventional (materials and layout), and much of the aesthetic effect of the page was taken care of \"in the font\". But the situation has long since changed, there is no longer a dominant harmonic structure which type designs must conform to.   \n   \n(Ironically, the scale of sizes in WP apps has put the masses in better touch with the principle of a harmony of type sizes in a page layout, than the majority of professional graphic designers, who get to create their own \"atonal cacophony\" out of peculiar size choices.)   \n   \nNow size-specific harmony, aesthetic perfection, if you will, is not crucial in the font, because there are hundreds to choose from, and all kinds of environments to use them in. And 8.75 pt, horizontal scaling of 95%, tracked to minus 3, works quite well for newspaper text.   \n   \nA number of foundries have realized that \"size-specific\" or \"optical-size\" is a rather one-dimensional term. For instance, HTF (and myself) have used the term \"Fine\" for what is ostensibly a large-size display font. Such would be suitable for newsprint headlines, but typographers can, and do, use these fonts for text work, when they have #1 coated stock.   \n   \nPoynter Oldstyle is available in different \"grades\" or \"tunings\" for different amounts of press gain.   \n   \nSo I'm with Hrant, \"human vision, not geometry\". Automations like MM, optical scaling, and optical kerning, when used across the board as generic modifications of many typefaces, will always be sloppy approximations to the craft that individual type designers use to create remarkable, specific instances of a typeface.   \n   \nUsed with discretion, automations are marvelous tools for the type designer creating special typeface families with a limited set or scale of optical sizes that relate to the typeface design (you can deduce that from Hrant's example, where apparently the \"g\" varies differently than the a!), but beyond that they are nothing more than glorified versions of the faux-bold button.\n\n"

My guess is that the whole falls into some logical method (even though the eye is indeed the gauge).   \n   \nThe dimension in the \"g\" missing from the \"a\" is the descender.

Below immersion you're basically making reading as painless as possible, not expecting high reading speeds, instead making sure there are no ambiguities. Above immersion you're appealing to deliberative, conscious aesthetic observation. But this doesn't mean aesthetics are irrelevant during immersion - who knows what the subconscious likes? It's only sure that the subconscious is a lot less worried about liking things, and more worried about getting the job done.   \n   \nHere's a _really_ rough graph I once did:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/optic\\_01.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918021333/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/optic_01.gif)   \n   \n\\> the only \\*solid\\* info we have to work   \n\\> with at this point is theoretical   \n   \nKinda. But the theory is derived in large part from empirical studies (from disparate fields). So you could say it's quasi-empirical.

It doesn't preclude designers from approaching the problem from an analytical angle, not just one of preconceptions and personal preference. There are different ideologies out there, and each can have validity in certain contexts, but there are also the realities of human perception and cognition.   \n   \nOne central tricky question is this:   \nWhat's a good balance of character versus legibility at the smallest sizes?   \n   \nFor example, does the ATF Garamond go too far? Is the Imprimerie Nationale's version\\* better because it preserves more of the Garamond character (albeit at the cost of reducing legibility)? How much character can be conveyed at 6 point? And what about the greater proportion of all-caps setting at the smallest sizes (I think the reason for the sudden shrinking in the descenders of the ATF)?   \n   \n\\* Thanks to Kent for helping me make these:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/garas\\_12.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918021333/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/garas_12.gif)   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/garas\\_10.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918021333/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/garas_10.gif)   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/garas\\_06.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918021333/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/garas_06.gif)   \n   \n--   \n   \nAs for the mechanics of using optically scaled type, I think generally a continuous axis -like in MM- is just fine, although MM is no longer well supported. So the application would generate the right instance based on the point size. And if you have a series of sizes instead of an axis, it would be great to have application support for choosing the closest ideal size automatically. Of course, this is the type of stuff MM should have done from day one, but they never implemented any automation at all... probably because the average user (the target of Adobe, but hopefully not everybody) went \"huh?\"...   \n   \n--   \n   \nI can even see software generating optical scaling automatically. Although it can never be as good as the man-made stuff, if the software could make the font wider, looser and darker for the smaller sizes, that would already help a lot. And if it could fiddle with the vertical proportions too, you'd be 90% there.   \n   \nAs for turning it off, it should be like an airbag: it should be on by default, and not trivial to turn off. People should only turn it off if they really think they really know what they're doing.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

What is not superb is what we have now, nothing. I suppose we could build something that is worse than nothing but let's not do that.   \n   \nBut when I said that the designer may wish for input you have found the right illustrations, which are very good. ATF seems to have moved strongly in favour of legibility. (Also from an analytical angle) But I am not to sure if they have gone too far? My own leanings favour Imprimerie Nationale's. However, I admit Lanston went the way of ATF. Both enhance legibility, the Imprimerie Nationale's preserves more characteristics of the face.   \n   \nMy prediction is that there will always be a designer who favours preserving characteristics of the design but seeking \"legibility gain\". And there will be the strongly \"functional personalities\" which will lean towards \"maximizing legibility\" at any cost.   \n   \nMaybe an on and off function? Oooh, that sounds like three stations on the dial, an \"off\", an \"artistic\", and \"maximizing legibility\" station. What do you think of calling it \"radio scaling\"? After all optical scaling is somewhat misleading.   \n   \nAlso I am in agreement that tackling this with an analytical angle is imperative.   \n   \nSpeaking of on and off functions. I am also in agreement with you that by default the best solution should be activated. But you can appreciate sometimes it nice to be able to turn things off such as kerning. That Birds & Tree   \n [http://www.lanstontype.com/SvartSkepp.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918021333/http:/www.lanstontype.com/SvartSkepp.html)   \ncolour ornament would not work as it does if that were not the case.   \n   \nWith the \"Birds & Tree\" you turn the kerning off, colour the elements in the unit, turn it on and they register. How much do you want for your dot. com? Write me.   \n   \nBut by default, yes keep the kerning on. Make the default the most useful function. That would also apply to \"radio scaling\". Actually when I think about \"radio scaling\" it is not a bad word for it. It conjures up \"other solutions\". \"Optical scaling\" as a name can indicated the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. After all, optical scaling is what we have now, type as though shrunk down by a lens.   \n   \nWhat we want is type \"scaled for human optics\". So it is receptive optics that we seek, not projective optics.   \n   \nOptical scaling was illustrated by inherent mechanical weakness.   \n   \nWhat I am saying is that Garamond did not use the word \"optical scaling\". ATF did?   \n   \nI am thinking out loud. Sorry. Anyway I know names can be silly. I think \"radio scaling\" is dynamic, may lead to several solutions. Certainly it is better than calling it \"optical scaling\" which is misleading or, a variation such as \"receptive optical scaling\" which is not elegant naming.   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nGerald Giampa   \nLanston Type Company\n\n"
