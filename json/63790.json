It makes some characters appear and reappear when I use it in indesign.\n\nMy encodings are corrected coz I have used it before, and had no problem.\n\nWould anyone by any chance know what's going on and how can I solve this?\n\nThanks in Advance\n\n",

Have you tried generating different formats?\n\nWhile it's true that your font \"works\", it sounds like it has a bug.\n\n"

Try relocating all start-points to the bottom left-hand corner and then rehinting the font.\n\nAndr√©\n\n"

Don't ask why :S\n\nA friend had the same problem once...\n\nAnyways\n\nThanks\n\nKj\n\n"
