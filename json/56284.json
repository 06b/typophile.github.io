The project gave me an excuse to tinker on the Arial alphabet. Here's the lc (with alt n m) and a text setting:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011125437im_/http:/typophile.com/files/arial_client_3884.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011125437im_/http:/typophile.com/files/arial_client2_5155.gif)\n\nI don't expect this to go further anytime soon. There's just enough to meet the deadline for the stationary package.\n\n",

It took me a while to find, but it dates way back to the dawn of Typophile, and my type journey. \\*Warning\\* the following link contains graphic images of font brutality:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/110](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011125437/http:/typophile.com/node/110 \"http://typophile.com/node/110\")\n\nIt played a bit part in a Typecon presentation in 2004, and there was some distinct snickering when the title went up. \\*sniff\\* Hehe. It is good to look back and see some progress.\n\nEdit for Nachos: It reads, but looks off balance, especially at the end of a word like \"butter\" ie round+stemless-r. The more the stemlessness goes in, the less workable in text. Dax and others counter this by injecting a corner for the missing stem. That allows them to bring the feature into the r,u,b,d,p,q etc.\n\n"

The superhinted screen rendering is nowhere near the legibility of, for example, Verdana. One needs the more open counters of a humanist sans design.\n\nIn any case, I think I like what Randy did here. The corner treatment feels like overexposed phototype, and combines with the missing stems to yield an interesting retro-futuristic feeling. (Having not gone back to re-read the whole thread, probably somebody else already said that....)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the comments. I think Arial is well hinted as rui abreu mentions, but also that the design is not as effective as other options for long stretches of running text, per Thomas.\n\nThe forms do have a benefit:  \nI recently watched the Helvetica film, and one comment sticks with me (I forget who it was). They were saying that all the letters in Helvetica feel like they are set in concrete when next to each other. It is down to the closed forms, and vertical stress with low contrast IMO. There is massive lockup for almost all letter combinations. This stability results in fonts well suited for making logos and setting headlines. Sounds like a recipe for overexposure and dulled creativity, which I think is the root of most people's issues with the genre.\n\nHowever, as I said in the main post, this project has shed a positive light on both Helvetica and Arial for me. Whenever I've tried to improve something I perceive as lacking, the result is that I esteem it more.\n\n"
