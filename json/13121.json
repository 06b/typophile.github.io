Service bureaus might want to replace fonts with a customer’s version on a per-job basis using a font manager. These fonts are Courier.dfont, Times.dfont, Symbol.dfont, Zapf Dingbats.dfont and Helvetica.dfont.\n\nWhile Helvetica is not an essential system font, some applications still require an active version of Helvetica in order to operate correctly. If you regularly use any applications that require Helvetica: As soon as you remove Helvetica from your system font folders, be sure to activate a version of Helvetica using your font manager (Suitcase or Font Reserve). It doesn’t matter which font format you use (PostScript, OpenType, TrueType, etc), but for professional creative, print and publishing environments, we recommend using a PostScript version of Helvetica.\n\nOystein\n\n"
