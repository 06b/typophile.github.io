  "content": "An elegant new typeface suitable for setting books and magazines. [Brioni](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212138/http:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/brioni/) developed spontaneously from practice with a broad-nib pen, but the result is a hybrid of calligraphic influences and subtle manipulation of the stroke terminals. Available also as [Brioni Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212138/http:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/brioni_text/), a sturdy slab serif for text of all sizes, but especially suitable for fine print. A highly functional typeface family that is easy to work with and inviting to read. Designed by Nikola Djurek, distributed by [Typotheque.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212138/http:/www.typotheque.com/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212138im_/http:/typophile.com/files/brioni_text_4096.png)\n\n",
