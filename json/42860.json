She wants a Victorian feel, but not too fancy. I feel it may be too simple . . . please help!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ScrapbookManorLogo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063702/http:/typophile.com/files/ScrapbookManorLogo.png) | 46.26 KB |\n\n [‹ Logo Brand Critique.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063702/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42453 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Film Production Company Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063702/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43125 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Once this logo is used small that URL will look more like a smudge.\n\nThey typeface used for “The” and the arabesques work together, but I don’t think they work with the rigidity of Caslon Openface. I do like the slight alteration you made in the o.\n\nThe word “The” is crammed into that space too.\n\n"

If you want more embellishments perhaps suggest some patterns to go along with the colours as part of the overall art direction.\n\nI like the face you are using for “Scrapbook Manor” also as it contrasts with the fluidity of the “the”.\n\nAre the grey glyphs going to be a PMS grey or a percentage of black?\n\nI think the www. is not needed. the .com part tells people it is a URL.\n\n"

What about a thin arabesque in the vertical space between ’pbook’ and ’nor’?\n\nRoss\n\n"
