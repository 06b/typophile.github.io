      "content": "I have been surveying \"typecast\" websites for the last several weeks searching for typewriter type images to use in a fontmaking project. I regret that I am unable to identify your typewriter model.  \nI can, however, inform you that the base font for it's capital letters is found on the \"element\" [the thing that looks like a golfball] for IBM typewriters bearing the font Orator, designed for IBM typewriters by John Scheppler in 1962. Digital version sold by Adobe, Linotype and Bitstream as [Orator](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804230840/http:/www.identifont.com/similar?TA).  \nSome typewriter companies added a lower case to the Orator capitals.  \nYour typewriter font is rather rare in that the lower case is sans serif letters rather than serifed.  \nIt may be digitized, but I have not come across it.  \nPerhaps one of our other typophiles has something for you.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "You're welcome.  \nInformation on typewriter font styles was published annually in the NOMDA Blue Book, the \"blue book\", as late as the 1970s, and perhaps the 1980s. Separate sections or books for each manufacturer. Some parts have been scanned and are available on-line at: [http://munk.org/typecast/?s=blue+book](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804230840/http:/munk.org/typecast/?s=blue+book \"http://munk.org/typecast/?s=blue+book\").  \nIf you can find a typewriter repair shop -- I expect they are almost extinct -- they may have copies that you could consult.  \nIf you wish to undertake further research into typewriters Munk's page has a good set of links to get you started on exploring the \"typosphere.\"  \nGood luck and good hunting.  \nDon\n\n"
