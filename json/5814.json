So people who did not attend the conference and are reading about all the (acceptably amusing) drunkenness that took place in San Fran paints the wrong picture about the conference, doesn't it? Sure, the parties seem \"better\" than ATypI's, but so  what?   \n   \nI'm gonna poop a little on this party by respectfully saying that this year's content was not nearly as good as Minneapolis. And I offer this with the utmost intention of being constructive. Last year's conference was a HUGE bargain for the price, lots of quality for a small sum of money, or like my favorite restaurant slogan: _Mucho Food, Poco Price_. This year it was _just_ a bargain.   \n   \nI'm not sure what it was, but most of the time you could find as many people outside of the conference room as inside. I did not see people as engaged as last year and I worry that next year in New York\n\n [‹ Where is Comenius?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208135429/http:/typophile.com/node/5927 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Frutiger and Times, used well ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208135429/http:/typophile.com/node/5934 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I can't agree or disagree with this, Armin, as I was not in Minneapolis. However, I have attended ATyp\\*I meetings and found this to be far more accessible and the principals far more interested in doing a bit of outreach to all the marginalized design student types than the folks at ATyp\\*I have ever attempted.   \n   \nAnd while I think your intentions are very good here, maybe the person who surveyed folks with the question of \"what animal does this typeface make you think of?\" might not be the right person to be leveling even a constructive criticism of Typecon's content. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208135429im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nI myself learned quite a lot - about Michael Harvey's work, about the history of calligraphy and its transferrence to digital form, about the history of early printing in the Americas and so much more.   \n   \nPerhaps the informal structure of Typecon does quite a bit to make the \"big stars\" more accessible to the rest of us - which in turn allows us to interface with them informally, which always provides a better setting for information transferrence than even the most structures and data-packed lecture or workshop. I learned plenty from my conversations with Jorge de Buen, Michael Harvey, Claudio Rocha, et. al.   \n   \nThe only downside I see to Typecon is the general structure of the meeting - that there is only one big lecture going on all the time. Every single talk is a \"general session\" - I think it would make more sense to have a few general sessions and a number of breakouts/workshops going on in 2 or 3 rooms all the time. But this is neither here nor there and I doubt it has much to do with your comments.   \nI don't want Typecon to turn into ATyp\\*I. Each organization and their meeting has its place, and if there is too much overlap we'll lose the informality of Typecon and the more rigid academic approach of ATyp\\*I, both of which would be a shame. Maybe Sota should embrace the fact that it is a different organization with a different character and that its annual Typecon is a completely different animal.\n\n"

True to your style.   \n   \nThe only other TypeCon that I've attended was the really small (and really inspirational) first one\\*. But I've been to about 7 type conferences so far, and except for ATypI Leipzig in '00 this one was the most meager in terms of content\\*\\*. Personally I was thinking it's simply my perspective, that many of the topics simply didn't interest me, but they might interest others - I know my taste is strange anyway. On the other hand, I think there's something to be said about having more than one track. Not three, I don't think, but the occasional missed talk caused by two tracks is made up by having more people attending the talks, getting more education out of it. So that's the one main thing I'd change for NY. But I wouldn't raise the price - not least because I noted the \"validation\" of so many students, like Andy saying now he knows he's doing the right thing. BTW, part of the craziness is probably due to the low price attracting younger people, that's all. Do we want TypeCon to be much older? We still have ATypI for that - and it's good to have differentiation, not just of geography but of spirit.   \n   \n\\* Interestingly, it was in the middle of nowhere, which maybe allowed for more focus. On the other hand, it's not like we left the 1-2 block area around the Nikko very much either...   \n   \n\\*\\* To make it up, Leipzig had the city, SF had The Party.   \n   \n--   \n   \nBTW, I thought the animal thing was much more than just laughs - to me it was very revealing, in the way that asking direct, obvious questions can never be.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "I imagine that at least part of the frustration you express stems from the difficulty of putting on an annual event. On one hand, the organizer wants to keep things fresh and interesting for people who have been there at least once before; on the other, you still need to offer more general things for the people for whom this particular conference is their first.   \n   \nThe result is that not all of the conference will end up being interesting to everyone, so naturally people will be out of the conference room at any given time, unless it's a major event. Like JLT, I can't compare this to last year, since I wasn't there, but for me, I learned quite a bit in the sessions (my three recaps are [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208135429/http:/foreword.ospreydesign.com/)). And if I was out of the session, I was meeting and talking with many interesting people. I think it's a credit to SoTA that the conference does attract so many friendly, down-to-earth people, which allowed me to vastly expand the number of people I actually know who love the same things I that I love.   \n   \nOf course, I'm sure I enjoyed the conference more than Armin's friend because I've been associated with the Typophile/Typographica community for a couple of years but had only until TypeCon been able to meet most in person, so I had more of a personal stake in going. Had I known only one person going in, I don't know what my experience would have been.   \n   \nAlso, Armin, I think part of your frustration is that you felt somewhat responsible for your friend having a good time, and it may have kept you from enjoying the conference as much as you might have otherwise. At any event, some people just aren't going to have a good time, for whatever reason or combination of reasons. That's the way it goes. But it doesn't necessarily reflect on the event.   \n   \nAt this point I'm planning on going next year. True, NYC has many diversions, and it may be more difficult to get people to sessions since the conference won't be at a hotel where everyone's staying. So SoTA has a challenge on its hands. One suggestion someone made was that there be more organized field trips. If people are going to wander, then have them wander together, right?   \n   \nThe only two general suggestions I would make to SoTA would be 1) to get the panels/presentations figured out much earlier than they were this year, or at least announce them earlier, and 2) appoint a timekeeper -- the events I went to almost uniformly started much later than announced, and many ran long. This was particularly a problem for the evening events, but it happened in the sessions as well. I will say, though, it seemed to get better by the end.\n\n"

      "content": "One more thing:   \nIt might seem backwards, but I think maybe the hospitality was too good! Those teas, coffees, cookies, cakes, bagels were really really good - they hit the spot bigtime in terms of recovering from the previous night, and making up for the lack of time to eat properly and relax - but I think they pulled people away from the talks. And the area outside the conference room was really light and attractive, it even had a great view. So basically the area outside the room was maybe too inviting!   \n   \nAnd if you think about it, this doesn't go with the inexpensive/youthful angle that TC enjoys, and probably should maintain. In fact every time I walked throught the Nikko lobby I was thinking: \"This is too fancy for us...\" An attendance that benefits from the low admission cost is less likely to depend on \"luxuries\" to enjoy the conference - the rest is basically content, and that can be good or bad in virtually any environment. And the money SoTA could save there could go towards paying for a second program track.   \n   \nAnd yet more suggestions! :-)   \n1) Change the auction in a big way, somehow - it needs help.   \n2) Turn the critique sessions into a bigger, better deal (not least for the students). More experts, different experts, from different areas (not just type design), better means of presentation (for one thing it's impossible to show non-print fonts), much better promotion, etc. They had trouble filling the ten spots - and certainly not because the experts were lemons.   \n   \nBTW, who's hosting NY? Hoefler, Terminal, a team?   \n   \n--   \n   \nChesh, I like your suggestions - especially the field trip one.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

And it doesn't even affect me, so this is not really personal, I was pleased with TC (well, I wasn't exactly, but you know what I mean), I had a good time, I attended some talks missed others, chatted outside the conference room, went to pee many times, I missed the cookies Hrant talks about, I did miss all the parties (but that was personal choice, I'm not the partying kind). And my friend who didn't like it, that's his fault not mine.   \n   \nTypeCon doesn't need to be AtypI, and hopefully it will never be, but that doesn't mean that it can't mature. And for what it's worth, I thought there were a LOT of older people at TC, there were lots of young ones but a lot of people over 50.   \n   \nAnd I would also like to add a suggestion. A moderator. Please. There was a huge disconnect between presentations, there was little to no continuity; that doesn't mean that back-to-back talks need to tackle the same topic, but there wasn't anything gluing the whole conference together. Sometimes it would be the TypeBox guys presenting the speakers, other times it was Kent Lew (who has my vote for moderator), other times Allan Haley and, heck, even me. The AIGA conferences do this very well, they have one person (true, it happens to be the amazing John Hockenberry) that \"leads\" the attendees in and out of each talk, he prepares questions for the presenter\n\n"

I agree with Andy in regards to being able to meet, network, and make new friends. I think it has been said in various places that being able to put a voice to a name and having real, one on one conversations in person and yes, even having a damned good time over drinks after the conference room closed, was incredibly enlightening and I think makes events like TypeCon very special.   \n   \n_Young people_, like myself, did indeed learn a great deal from what I saw and experienced, you can't beat this kind of education, (and honestly am slightly annoyed by the notion that the young people had something to do with the lack of focus.) Reading a book isn't nearly as benificial as seeing and experiencing in person. Many of the speakers are highly influential on younger designers, and it was thrilling to see and learn from people (Akira Kobayashi, Ed Benguiat, Erik Spiekermann, to name only a few) who are currently being taught in design schools. I personally give a lot of credit to SOTA for making sure that students are included in these events.   \n   \n   \n   \nAnd that is my two cents.   \n   \nZara\n\n"

The conversation started from the quiz question about what the \"A\" was. I stated that the conventional story was a case of Christian censorship - bullshit, if you would pardon the pun. And I drew what Kallir thought each letter symbolized: Man, Woman, Womb, Pregnancy, Delivery, Mother & Child, Man Exalting (the \"G\" was skipped, for obvious reasons), etc. Sure it was kind of a sexual/fun thing but I think it's worth knowing (Johanna Drucker covers it in her book too). This is one way the party had some \"content\" - and I'm sure people all over the room were having similar quasi-typographic discussions, even in that noise and booze. You don't learn everything in an auditorium.   \n   \nSo maybe people (especially those like me who don't get enough partying done throughout the year) enjoy talking about the debauchery most, but that doesn't mean that's all they got out of the event. For one thing, Palatino Sans was totally jaw-dropping, and Roger Black's advice was 24 carat gold.

      "content": "A few thoughts about the talks this year, from the perspective of a first time type conference attendee.   \n   \n8:30 in the morning is an ungodly hour of the morning but some of the best speakers - ken barber and underware - were scheduled in that slot. Perhaps this was to encourage us to get up early and take in the whole day. To me, it meant I had to choose between getting to know other type nuts at night or attending morning sessions. I would have preferred to do both but I ended up skipping all the 8:30 sessions.   \n   \nCrazy party photos aside, type aficionados can be a timid bunch and a certain energy seemed to be lacking from the sessions, especially earlier in the conference. Maybe typecon needs two tracks for smaller cozier talks? moving the party earlier in the week? summer-camp style icebreakers? bigger nametags? Have Tony and Caio Silva MC the sessions?   \n   \nI gotta agree with Hrant that the Nikko was too fancy a venue. The beer cost $7 a bottle and the bathrooms were impeccable. It gave the conference airs of professionalism rather than the informal gathering I expected.   \n   \nI may sound like a whiner, but don't get me wrong - Typecon was awesome. There were a number of things that alone were worth the price of admission.   \n- Being amazed by Bickham's use of Opentype.   \n- The Young Guns panel. Talk about a kick in the , even if the old guys already stole all our best ideas.   \n- The Ken Barber & Ed Benguiat repartee.   \n- Seeing moneyed interests duke it out at the lunch DRM session, a candid introduction to the business side of type.   \n- Above all, finally giving faces to the names of fellow typophilers.\n\n"

Other conferences are on a schedule, you get a   \nsense that if you're not running to the next thing that you're   \nmissing out.   \n   \nOn the other hand, and unlike any other conference, TypeCon   \nfeels like familiy. Few conferences (maybe especially design   \nconferences) can do that. But maybe that's the problem, maybe   \nit's too comfortable - too loose. I'll leave that as an open   \nquestion.   \n   \nTypeCon was not a drunken trainwreck. It just so happens that   \nthe bulk of the photographs surfacing show it that way. The pics   \nyou're seeing are from the last night of the 'con. There were a   \nfew moments that evening when I wondered if someone was   \nfilming Wild On TypeCon or something. (Hrant that was my   \njacket with your dinner on it.)   \n   \nI also agree that multiple \"tracks\" would be great. The more you   \nhave to make hard choices about which lectures or panels to   \nsee, the better.   \n   \nThe vendor area was great. The quantity and the quality   \nwere both stunning.   \n   \nThe gallery was great again this year, but unfortunately it always   \nseems tucked back away somewhere away from the people. You   \nfeel like you're going to miss something if you actually take time   \nto look at the gallery. Maybe that's just as it should be.   \n   \nAn aside: What did you all think of the 2 evenings beforehand   \nwith the AIGA there. Was this just the AIGA getting on the band-   \nwagon at the last minute or did it generate more attention in the   \nlocal design community? I'd be interested to know what the   \norganizers think. I know the sheer number of events with   \ndifferent admission structures confused more than one person.\n\n"

      "content": "I thought TypeCon was a good conference, but not a great one. A single track conference is difficult because not everything will appeal to everyone. Inviting speakers is always something of a crap shoot, and you do get disappointing talks occasionally. Having helped organize a couple of conferences I don't think TypeCon was loose at all. It ran pretty well and the rotating (intentional?) moderators was nice. One track also makes it more important to not fall behind, but I've never been to a conference that ran on schedule.   \n   \nWith a two track conference you have less of that, though there's the problem of wanting to hear two talks at the same time. I always have this problem with ATypI conferences, but you do get a sense of \"better bang for your buck\" even if you can't take it all in.   \n   \nThere were several very good talks, but there was a definite difference between serious and entertaining ones as one presenter pointed out. It might have been helpful to have some of the smaller workshops going on at the same time as talks, and there's also room to have some smaller, more informal talks going on. There could be more breadth perhaps, but then you get stuff that's only marginally related like some of the SVA Modernism conferences.   \n   \nThe other aspect is the TypeCon audience. It has a very broad range in age and a broader group focus. I like the age span which gives it a very different feel from other type conferences. The pictures of revelers on the internet is just one aspect of youth and the invention of tiny digital cameras and picture phones. It does make us look less serious as a group, but so what?   \n   \nI liked the hotel. Yes it was expensive to eat and drink, but no more so than Minneapolis. I've been to low rent conferences and wished for nicer accomodations, but maybe that's my age. And I thought 8:30 was fine for a starting time. Ungodly?\n\n"

It is far easier, I believe, to please everyone if the cost is reasonable and the rooms clean. I for one am happy with the Nikko and know that the choice wasn't done with much thought.   \n   \nAnother comment about the sessions. The more it is mentioned the more I wonder if two tracks might not be good. Or as someone (Armin?) suggested earlier 1 and 1/2 tracks. The single track for the big names/big topics and the two tracks (maybe on the last day?) for the more focused topics (unicode for instance, or history of the serif).\n\n"

But the audience was very young, I thought (young maybe being a little older? German students tend to be in their mid-20s, not 19).   \n   \nSo, from my completely irrelevant POV, it sounds like TypeCon was almost the total opposite of this year's TypoBerlin (and I would have probably liked TypeCon more ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208135429im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif) ).

In Vancouver I wanted a maximum of two tracks, but the lecture spaces at the venue meant that we couldn't get all the attendees into two rooms, so we had three tracks, and sometimes had a workshop running concurrently. It just about worked, I think, although trying to balance the three tracks so that they would appeal to appropriately sized groups of attendees was a real challenge. I still think two tracks plus workshops is optimal. The tracks should run in tandem and be close enough that people can comfortably get from one to the other between sessions. The workshops do not need to run in tandem with the presentation tracks, which means more time can be taken. In Vancouver, we let the workshop instructors determine how long those sessions should be, and they varied.   \n   \nI hope this is helpful to someone, somewhere, planning a conference programme.\n\n"

I think that only really works in conferences where the expenses of a given participant are paid by a rich employer, not himself. On the other hand, I think maybe ATypI will be able to get away with it because it's such a small, insular community, and the bulk of the people on a conference program would go to the conference anyway, so basically they lose less money by \"forcing\" their admission fee. In comparison, since TypeCon admission is so low, I think there's more room to maneuver - and that bodes well for speaker/program variety.   \n   \nPlus there's a cultural thing going on too. Jorge de Buen told me for example that South Americans shy away from organizing international conferences because they feel obliged to pay for the speakers' expenses (and not just admission either), but know they can't afford it.   \n   \n\\> somebody has to put up money   \n   \nWell, that's true. Like at the close of TC98 Bob Colby had a panicked look on his face, because the conference was going to end up costing him a lot of money, personally. In the end he broke even, but only because: he got maybe 1/4 of the participants to become SoTA members, although I guess that wasn't much dough; all but one\\* of the speakers agreed to pay for his own expenses.   \n   \n\\* Don't ask me who it was - I still don't know.

Thanks for your comment on:   \n   \n\\>More tracks, shorter sessions and more workshops would equal more free passes.   \n   \n...to which I would add:   \n   \nThere are many variables which apply to both conferences: how far the speaker travels, whether he/she works for a company that can afford to pay for them (or is a sponsor -- and how large of a sponsor); how desirable they are to the conference as a speaker -- both for content and \"drawing power\", and so on. I think it's fair to say that both SOTA and ATYPI will waive admission fees for a speaker if they think it's absolutely necessary, but would rather not.   \n   \nAs someone who has been a local TypeCon organizer (Toronto, 2002) I can tell you that there is a fair amount of hit-and-miss in getting a program of speakers together. Many people we approached turned down the opportunity to speak, for various reasons, including financial. Some never even knew what they missed -- I contacted the Toronto publisher of Alberto Manguel (A History of Reading) and was told \"he lives in France\" and was given his agent's name. That sounded expensive, so I left it at that.   \n   \nDespite being on the SOTA board, there are always plenty of surprises for me in the program every year. That's because the local organizers play such a large role in determining the program. I think the local content is always fascinating, and this year's was no exception -- Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin, amazing stuff. With an an emphasis on lettering, yes, there was not so much pure typography (eg text type, Thomas), but that's the way things turned out, and what gave this conference its personality. I'm sure New York will have its own flavor.   \n   \nEmory Douglas, what a profoundly different perspective: asked who his design influences were, he replied he had none, he was just getting the message out.\n\n"
