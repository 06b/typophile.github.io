      "content": "In the US there's also the doctrine of \"first sale\", which says that once a particular copy of a work has been sold, the copyright holder no longer has the right to control distribution of that particular copy. That is, the physical medium containing the copy. This is a separate issue from transferring the license.   \n   \nA few years ago, Adobe lost a [case](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018140232/http:/cryptome.org/softman-v-adobe.htm) in which it claimed that the EULA prevented a retailer from buying bundled applications and selling them individually. The court held that although Adobe called the transfer a license, it was structured like a sale; and since the retailer did not assent to the EULA, they weren't bound by it.   \n   \nOkay, so what if the seller had assented to the EULA? At the time the seller agreed to the EULA, he was granted a license to use the software (or fonts, etc.). (Just as you, the buyer, would be granted a license when you agree.) Obviously the seller can no longer continue to use or keep a copy if he choses to sell the media; but at that point, the seller may no longer be bound by the EULA.   \n   \nTo put it another way: not all provisions of the EULA continue to apply after the seller reverts his asset. Would a condition that restricted first sale rights continue to apply? I don't know the answer, and I'm not sure the answer is known, but there's an awful lot of used software for sale.   \n   \nNow suppose instead that the seller isn't offering to send you physical media, but, instead, a pile of bits. Last fall EBay cancelled a listing where someone was trying to sell bits he got from iTunes. Unless the bits were public domain or the license allowed this, I don't see how such a sale could be legal.   \n   \nThis is all assuming that shrinkwrap licenses are valid, which is unclear. And legal does not mean ethical. And I am not a lawyer; this is not legal advice; and it's probably all wrong anyway.\n\n"

      "content": "One thing to keep in mind about buying software on E\\*Bay is that there's a lot of piracy there. If you see somebody advertising Photoshop 7 for $50, then you should assume there's something wrong. Most commonly, it's either a pirated copy in the first place, or unregisterable because the person upgraded to the next version, and is (illegally) selling their previous version.   \n   \nI don't mean to tar all E\\*Bay software sales with that brush; there are plenty of good deals on old versions of software there. But sometimes, perhaps often, if the price seems just too good to be true, it is indeed too good to be true.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"
