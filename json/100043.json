It looks a lot like Trade Gothic (and probably is)  \n2. Jason Santa Maria, who is noted as the designer of the books has expressed his love for Trade Gothic on several occasions online.  \nOne is in Fontshop newsletter [http://www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/june10a/indexEMAIL.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103103459/http:/www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/june10a/indexEMAIL.html \"http://www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/june10a/indexEMAIL.html\") and a small part of one cover is shown, but that super condensed/compressed version shown is not available at Fontshop, as far as I can see.\n\nSo, if anyone knows: Where can I buy this font?\n\nRegards,\n\nSigurdur Armannsson at 64°N\n\n",
