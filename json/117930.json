  "content": "I created a font years ago (OTF) before the embedding restriction became an issue. How can i remove any embedding restrictions without re-creating the font in FontLab (too many VOLT hours involved). Just to change the flag!  \nAn old MS tool (Font properties editor) won't help since it doesn't allow to completely remove the restriction to \"Installable\", only to increase the restriction. Any idea?\n\n",

Use the fonttools as described in the url [http://www.typophile.com/node/102671](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044719/http:/www.typophile.com/node/102671 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/102671\")\n2. Use ttx. First execute `ttx -t OS/2 fontname.ttf` (or otf); that produces a small file named `fontname.ttx` containing only the `OS/2` table; you then replace with a text editor the value given at the line `<fsType value=\"00000000 00001000\"/>` (the value you get is probably different) by the value you want; you then finally execute the command `ttx -m fontname.ttf fontname.ttx` to get your new font.\n3. Buy DTL OTMaster to edit the OS/2 table; we are told the font is left otherwise untouched. If it is not, you tell us.\n\n"

They have a command `hackos2` in their impressive list [FontUtils](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044719/http:/scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=fontutils) of font utilities (that I have never tried).\n\n"
