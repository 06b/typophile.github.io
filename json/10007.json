There must be at least 4 or 5 of these in [Part 5 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20080607071543/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg1.html). If you give me a few minutes I may be able to pinpoint which one this is, or at least give you some similar alternatives.\n\n"

      "content": "Well, I've looked through all 38 pages of Part 5, and this isn't one of the eight 'blob serif' fonts I had already collected. If you want to look them up, they are: Sheryl (p.1), Sorority Hack (p. 8), Telegram (p.9), Argetab Obbed (p.9), Chubble (p.21), Cool Dots (p.24), Joker Wild (p.26) and Bill's Holiday (p.29). There is also Adelita from Type-O-Tones, which I do not have a sample for (yet).   \n   \nYour font looks like it was done by someone with a better than average flair for lettering, so it's possible it's a commercial font, or at least the work of a professional. There are several scrapbooking sites that include fonts mostly done by amateurs, and this style is often seen. ['Telegram'](http://web.archive.org/web/20080607071543/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/telegram/telegram/testdrive.html?s=Scrappin+Fabulous&p=48) by Timothy Donaldson, which would need to be darkened, or Robert Schenk's [Argetab Obbed](http://web.archive.org/web/20080607071543/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/argentab-obbed/bold/testdrive.html?s=Scrappin+Fabulous&p=48) might be good alternatives among commercial fonts.   \n   \nI hope this helps.\n\n"
