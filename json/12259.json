I hasten to add that I have little control over which faces they are. Some of them are nice, some are not my favorites. Anyway, what I want to know is: can some of you good people think of any really amazing things that have been done using:\n\nFutura, Univers 55, Mrs Eaves, Optima, Helvetica Neue Black Extended, VAG rounded or Minion?\n\nHmm… An odd collection to be sure.\n\nWell, let me know if you think of anything. If you provide a link I’d love you forever, but just the info would be good.\n\nThanks :)\n\n—sn0w\n\n",

Such a good one, though, I’m going to have to use it anyway :)\n\nI like the eight08 one, very inventive use of the ‘gi’ ligature indeed!\n\nThank you formlos, most kind.\n\n"
