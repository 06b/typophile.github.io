I think the reason I do it is that I'm afraid I might accidentally right-click or something, even though I know that won't happen. I'm giving it another go, being careful to keep that finger relaxed and resting on the surface. So far so good.\n\nI have a similar problem using a Wacom tablet. The stylus makes parts of my hand go numb after an hour or so. It doesn't happen when I use a pen or pencil, so I'm not sure why it happens.\n\nHere's what my desktop looks like today:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130213155053im_/http:/typophile.com/files/marksdesk_5727.jpg)\n\nMy desktop background (wallpaper to Windows users) is a blurry accidental photo of the floor in the Plantin-Moretus Museum.\n\n"

I tried Kensington, all the Logitech models. For a couple of years I used the low end Logitech with no scroll wheel. The Logicool cordless is a bad design, I tried for a few weeks but I could only use it for about 8 hours in a row. It's a poor design because you have to take the weight off your hand when dragging: sore shoulders. Also, the ball doesn't coast properly. For 50 cents I picked up a used Trackman Wheel. The ball's coasting is the best I've tried. Using a thumb gives you about the same control as fingers and a proper scroll wheel. I don't have to move my arm at all and the flick & coast action means, I can go all the way across. When I need to cross the screen from right to left, I can drop my thumb on the ball and spin it, then stop,catch when it's in the right spot. Try it but save money and skip the Logicool cordless.\n\n"
