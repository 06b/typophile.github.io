Also, the principles are near to iTunes, so it’s quite easy to use.\n\n[http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706085443/http:/www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX \"http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX\")\n\nFor your font families becoming active when added to suitcase, it depands on your preferences.\n\n"
