It is not very funny, but she thinks it is, and to add insult to injury, the entire thing is set in Comic Sans. I had to bite my lip, as the proliferation of Comic Sans in our company emails has become a running joke among a few of my peers here at the plant, and this is the icing on the cake.\n\nIs it my responsibity to enlighten my supervisor? I consider it an embarrassment to the art department as a whole, but I am not the art director, so should I just let it go and shake me poor head in despair?\n\nWhat would Tschichold do?\n\n [‹ Intensely bored with my job](http://web.archive.org/web/20071214062106/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37920 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Hello All! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071214062106/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37909 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I mostly posted this for the amusement of other folks like me...\n\nThe real question is: If you have a supervisor who is artistically, graphically, and intellectually your inferior, how in the hell do YOU cope with it? It’s one thing if you’re in a larger market, where you could consider finding a different employer...but suppose you have no other legitimate options for employment?\n\nI guess this is a business ethics question and may not be appropriate for this forum.\n\nSo...have fun with the your replies, please!
