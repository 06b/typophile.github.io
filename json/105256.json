  "content": "I'm putting together some signage for a farmer friend, and he really wants a conventional \"farmstand\" aesthetic. He showed me an old sign from his barn (attached) that he really likes, and wants something along the same lines. I realize many traditional farm signage was hand lettered, but I really am looking to purchase a font in this case, mostly for the sake of time. Anyone know of a good source? My first instinct was Letterhead Fonts, but nothing there really did the trick for me.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen shot 2013-08-05 at 7.40.20 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302160510/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202013-08-05%20at%207.40.20%20PM.png) | 241.12 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "You haven't reposted this to another section yet, so I'll go ahead and put my answer here.\n\nIf this is for a small farm stand (eggs, vegetables, etc sold by a family member in front of a farm), I think a hand lettered sign would be far more appropriate than a slick, professional sign. In fact when I was a design student in college, my professor used a farmstand sign as an example of a situation where a crude, hand-lettered sign on a piece of cardboard or plywood was entirely appropriate, and communicated the proper message.\n\nAs for the screen shot, that might be appropriate for a company selling farm equipment, but not for a farmer's child selling eggs by the driveway. If you want to use a font, I'd suggest looking for one that looks handwritten but is easy to read and perhaps has a bit of style, as if the farmer's artistic wife made it.\n\n(But if this is a bigger setup, like a building or large professional stand that's more like a retail store, then that's a different situation.)\n\n"
