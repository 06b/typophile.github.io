Their difference is just a singe pixel... ![arizona mod 01](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145639im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13357.gif)\n\n"

It is perfect for a cell phone game I'm doing art assets for, but I can't even locate a download/purchase, not to mention a license for such use.\n\nMiguel, did you ever complete Arizona and Kuppa and make them available to the world at large? (I don't find them in your excellent collection at Atomic Media, though there are some clearly influenced there. In particular, I also love Tekilla.)\n\nAnyway, they are both excellent bitmap fonts, and I'd love to have them available for use. Please let me know how/where to find them.\n\n"
