But being a man with a seemingly un-annalitical brain, I just cant exactly comprehend this. Could somone spell this out in lamens terms? All I have ever seen written on it is very technical mathmatical expressions. Does anyone have any good examples of layouts that comply to the guidlines of the Golden Section?? Would love to hear/learn more about this.   \n   \nhildebrant.\n\n",

      "content": "I'm sure somebody can point you to a nice web resource, but I would recommend a book: \"Geometry in Design\" by Kimberly Elam. It's a \"light\" work, but contains a nice treatment of various geometric \"ideals\" in design, and Nature. Of course it has a section on the Golden Section.   \n   \nWhat bugs me about the Golden Section is this: since it deals with proportions of _length_, when you use it for surfaces (like in type design), do you _square-root_ it? I've never seen a convincing discussion of that.   \n   \nBTW, I also have an article from an old issue of PEI (back when they encouraged thinking, instead of being a source for Qwik Trix with Fotopix type ) that discussed the Golden Section with great insight. But please don't ask me to find it! :-/   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "hmmmm. The golden section is quite a big subject.   \nIt's not that difficult. (I wrote a paper about it ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019232028im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) ). Maybe first a link to start: [the pages of mr Knott](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019232028/http:/www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/phi.html#golden), which have a big deal to say about the golden section, and helped me alot. Non-designed, but filled with information & examples on the subject. (I always liked the part about Fibonnacci and his rabbits ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019232028im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif))   \n   \nIn fact, it is just a proportion of 1 to 1,618.... Some people believe this is the \"divine proportion\" because it appears in nature so often (this has rather economical reasons, see Professor Knott's pages). I think it is rather difficult to apply to design, because of it's irrational nature. Le Corbusier used it to design his buildings (he made a system out of it, called 'le Modulor'); Wiedemann used it in his Corporate ACE-typefaces (and the Mercedes-star). Many bookcovers have this proportion also. There is alot written about applying this to bookdesign (see Bringhurts \"Elements of Typography\" for instance), and I think Tschichold studied it and distilled a method to apply it to the margins of a page...   \n   \nhope this gets you going...\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant, you're to quick for me! Yes 'Geometry in Design' is a indeed good book for showing some examples of applying the GS. I forgot about it ...   \n   \nThere are many proportion-systems, Palladio used the proportions that are based on the musical harmonies. There is a magnificent book on that (only architecture tough) by **Rudolf Wittkower** : _Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism_ (1949).   \nI think one should just find a system (or make up his own) that suits him (and the job) and apply that to his design, so you have a certain consistency in your design.\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant:   \n_What bugs me about the Golden Section is this: since it   \ndeals with proportions of_ length_, when you use it for   \nsurfaces (like in type design), do you_ square-root _it?_  \n  \nNo! If you have a rectangle and sections the longer side   \naccording to the golden ratio the areas you get will still   \nbe, of course, in the (A+B/A = A/B) relationship.   \nThis is a misleading question. The \"visual assessment\" of   \nthe relationships of surfaces was not very much the point.   \nThe two more important applications of the golden ratio   \nwere the golden section (=cut) which deals with the   \npositioning of an element inside a certain width, and the   \ngolden rectangle, which is a shape. Though the ratio is the   \nsame, these are quite unrelated perceptual experiences.   \nNaturally, if the rectangle you sectioned above was a   \ngolden rectangle to begin with, you get a square and a   \nnew golden rectangle, so you begin to tie the loose ends.   \n  \nNow, the mathematical validity of the golden ratio is   \nuniversal, it turns up in many natural phenomena (\\*),   \netc., but the question is: does it have any _aesthetic_  \nvalidity outside the area of Greek cultural influence   \n(the so-called \"West\")? For instance does it appear in   \nIslamic (\\*\\*) architecture and decoration somehow? (As   \nyou know, the Muslims were the heirs and \"keepers\" of   \nGreek culture through the middle ages.) In China? In   \nJapan?   \n  \nFor those interested in the golden ratio, I recommend a nice   \nlittle book called _The Divine Proportion_, by H.E. Huntley.   \nIt's edited by Dover, and not hard to find, I think.   \n  \n(\\*) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/science/story/0,12450,875198,00.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019232028/http:/www.guardian.co.uk/online/science/story/0%2C12450%2C875198%2C00.html)  \n  \n(\\*\\*) The golden ratio is directly related to the pentagon,   \nand the Muslims have a much greater interest in the octagon,   \nAFAIK.\n\n"
