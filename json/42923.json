  "content": "Hi Guys!\n\nI've been wondering for quite some time whether there is a satisfying solution for syncing fonts on two macs. I'm currently using FontAgentPro to keep my Fonts organized and I know that there is the possibility of a FontAgentProServer but that might be a bit over the top unless you're a design agency with 10+ employees imo.\n\nSyncing the FontAgentPro Folder in the Userhome directory didn't work since the files have to be imported in FontAgent to appear.\n\nDoes anyone know any solution for this?\n\nkind regards,  \nmike\n\n",
