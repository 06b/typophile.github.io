I say this just to get the ball rolling, because I looked for the smaller one yesterday when I first saw the post. I used my [Sans Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000447/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html) using the assumption that the bar of the 'e' is horizontal, and couldn't find it. I will try again with the assumption that the bar is not horizontal, and see if I see anything. The 'W' is the most distinctive feature and the curved 'l' and round-bowl 'y' are also good 'field-marks' for ID purposes.\n\n"

      "content": "I just looked in the Sans ID Guide for something with a sloped 'e'-bar and found nothing that comes closer than Font Bureau's \"Berlin Sans\", and I know it's not identical. This is a sans font I haven't catalogued yet, so it makes me think it's either very new, or from a small foundry. I know I have a long way to go yet for the sort of comprehensiveness I want in that Guide, but with about 700 sans families catalogued, it should be a significant part of the commercial fonts you might expect to see.\n\n"
