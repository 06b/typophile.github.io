Assuming we want the folks that receive pdf's to be able to view and print them as designed -- is there a way to prevent such access, without locking down the whole pdf?\n\n",

      "content": "Unfortunately the only avenue is to buy fonts from vendors who sell embedding rights. Some fonts (Adobe for example) are embeddable off-the-shelf. Some foundries (such as Emigre) offer embedding licenses for a price. To stay legal you just need to choose fonts that allow it. But if a restrictive foundry has a font that you Simply Must Use, do try contacting them and making them an offer. They will listen, and you might arrive at a deal.\n\n"
