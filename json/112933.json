  "content": "Working on a refresh of the museum’s CI focusing on type. The museum architecture is modern, the exhibits obviously are not. I am looking for a flexible, contemporary type family that can carry some of that historic/vintage flavor without looking old fashioned. A contemporary and fresh look with some subtle reference to type/letters/history of writing. Not an easy task. Your ideas are most welcome.\n\n",

There is a web world of typewriter aficionados who hunt down old typewriters -- google \"typosphere\" -- and publish the results of their typing on them -- google \"typecast.\"  \nA fascinating alternative to using modern fonts would be to contact some of these people and ask if they would type text for the museum on their vintage machines. It could then be scanned and the result -- complete with variations in darkness, alignment etc. -- would be a true homage to the typewriter. I suspect that most of these people would be prepared to work for almost nothing or even for free. Extreme dedication to promoting public awareness and appreciation of typewriters is their vocation.  \nDon\n\n"

I forgot to mention however, that logo and lettering for the museum are already given and cannot be altered.  \nFor body text, folders, exhibition panels, and other communication needs, including web, I can’t see typewriter letterforms to work.  \n@jidoe Yes, Adelle could be an option or Vitesse by H&FJ [http://tinyurl.com/pcz359k](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416003857/http:/tinyurl.com/pcz359k \"http://tinyurl.com/pcz359k\")  \n@Té Rowan »an exhibit focusing on type rather than typewriters« Misunderstanding. My fault. The focus on type refers to my approach — not the museum’s. Typewriters (and the type they produce) are the core content of the museum. Pictures, including details and closeups of both old typewriters and their output (scans as suggested) are already used profusely in all the advertising materials. What I am looking for now is a consistent form of presentation (print, screen, web) in which type (descriptions, articles, basically all types of editorial stuff) will have a prominent role.  \nApologies again for my poor english.\n\n"
