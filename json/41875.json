      "content": "Looking in Mac McGrew's great book on \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century\" I can see that this looks identical to ATF's Century Bold Condensed, designed by Morris Benton in 1906, and released in 1909. This type was produced in sizes from 6 to 72 point, and also available from Monotype, Intertype and Ludlow, if I read the notes correctly.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
