I'll be submitting only the regular weight, but plan to have at least a bold and light.\n\nThis same design was posted earlier under the name Marua, but the name didn't stick.\n\nI'm still in the process of spacing and kerning, but thought I'd post a more refined version of what I posted before. Any comments would be lovely.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TCDaphne.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819231452/http:/typophile.com/files/TCDaphne_0.pdf) | 51.89 KB |\n| [TCDaphne.1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819231452/http:/typophile.com/files/TCDaphne.1.pdf) | 92.2 KB |\n| [TCDaphne.1a.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819231452/http:/typophile.com/files/TCDaphne.1a.pdf) | 93.48 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Arlo\n\nProbably wouldn't hook the b, h and k - not sure you need to and the l and d would fit better. Maybe that's just me.\n\nC and c (and G and G.sc) bottom strokes come out too far in my head.\n\nShould your y look more similar to the v (and w and x)?\n\nAll O's (and Q's) look egg-shaped to me... is that deliberate?\n\nStruggling with the vertical alignment of the 4's: I know why the lining 4 sticks up above caps line but it ought not to. Maybe lower the cross bar on the old style (or raise the vertical stroke on the lining 4) and the problem might go away.\n\nFir info, Q.sc has dropped down slightly.\n\nFine work. I particularly love the punctuation marks.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick,\n\nThanks for the critique. It seems that it's been pretty light in this area. Or maybe it's just what I post. lol.\n\nI don't think the hooks on the b, h and k affect too much of the readability at small sizes and they add a little more character when at larger sizes. (I did try it though, but the overall effect seemed more flat)\n\nI adjusted the C, c and G, G.sc just the slightest bit and it did help the overall width feel better. Nice catch.\n\nI'm not sure if I follow what you mean by egg-shaped. They are intentionally not circular, but more ovular.\n\nAnd another good catch on the 4 and the Q.sc. Both have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nI'm hoping to have the complete character set ready within the next couple days.\n\n"

Maybe not necessary but some include those.\n\nWould like to see a lowercase j with same structure as f but rotated, roughly speaking.\n\nAlso, don't think the long J (as used in I\\_J) fits that well with the rest of set. It's the one character which loojks like it has come from a different font in my mind.\n\nQuite like the staggered double quotes, however, isn't the implication that the single quotes need to stagger too for the sake of rotational logic? Second thoughts, you've probably got it right; just making sure you've thought it through.\n\nGood work, Arlo. Looks lovely set in copy.\n\n"

I've added the ligatures Nick recommended and updated a couple characters I wasn't totally happy with—another good catch with the long J; Eng and eng as well as the j and the IJ ij glyphs. Overall I'm pretty happy. Again, thanks to everybody for the comments. Next step: kerning, ugh.\n\n"
