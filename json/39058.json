  "content": "King's Caslon is Dalton Maag's latest addition to its exclusive font library. It is based on the custom font we designed for the King's College London earlier this year. The main differences are that instead of a Semi-Bold we provide a Bold weight and we have added a few extra ligatures to the fonts. King's Caslon is available with Standard or Typo characterset. To see what it looks like, use TypoGFX for testing.\n\nTo view the King's Caslon and test Typo GFX go to [http://www.daltonmaag.com/typogfx/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013150723/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/typogfx/ \"http://www.daltonmaag.com/typogfx/\")\n\nThis release of TypoGFX is for public Beta testing. We would like to hear your comments and suggestions to make it an even better tool.\n\nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag Ltd\n\n",
