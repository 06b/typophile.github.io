      "content": "While at some level it is a matter of personal preference -- there are some common conventions that one violates at considerable risk. The British, for example, use a word-spaced en dash for the dash that signals a break in the thought within a sentence. In the States, a closed-up em dash is usually used for this purpose -- see, for example, the CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE.\n\nHaving said that, we typically use a dash 3/4ths of an em long centered in an em space (a dash of 750 units with left & right sidebeaings of 125 units with a 1,000 unit em) for the \"em\" dash. With really condensed fonts, I'll make the dash \\*about\\* the width of a capital M, and the sidebearings won't be 125 units. I've done this for over 10 years now, & no publisher has yet complained.\n\nWith en dashes -- usually used with numbers -- I'll usually make up 2 dashes, one to center up (vertically) with uppercase (lining) figures, and one to better center up with lower-case (oldstyle) numbers. Usually only one em dash, though. I suppose one could make a slightly higher dash for capitals with OpenType fonts, just as one makes up extra parens & brackets for full capitals.\n\n"

      "content": "Not that it's particularly relevant but, in the olden days when setting type meant staring at a stunning amber (or green) screen full of monospaced characters and trying to keep a mental picture of where you were on the page, we used to insert a thin nonbreaking space to the left, and a thin regular space to the right of an em dash. The rationale was that if the line had to break in the vicinity of the dash, it would do so after, rather than before the dash, or--if there were no spaces at all--carry the dash and the words either side of it to the next line, which sometimes made for excessive white space. Nowadays you can actually see what you're doing, so it may be a moot point, but we old-timers are inclined to spin yarns about the days of yesteryear at the least provocation.\n\n"

Of course, a lot of American conventions are -- like placing end quotes after the period even though the clause within the quotes is \"not a complete sentence.\"\n\n"

Very Midwesternly efficient... and stuffy if you ask me.\n\nI've held the University of Chicago in contempt for far greater impositions, such as exporting their faculty to the Art Institute of Chicago to suck the life out of foreign cinema courses.\n\nI'm a half-space kinda guy for emdashes in text settings. I've taken to setting my sidebearings for such a preference when desgining my typefaces. Just my way of getting back at U of C, I guess.\n\nRaising the endash between lining numerals is a valuable lesson as well. Thanks for advocating that one, Charles. With Opentype, such automatic adjustments are easily within reach.\n\n"

There was the regular one, a full em dash on the em width, and what Merg. called a 3/4 em dash, full em width, but the dash was only 3/4 of the em with essentailly a thin built-in on either side. I think most Em dashes today are actually the old 3/4, and the authentic em is dropped.\n\n"
