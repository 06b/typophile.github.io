I saw plans for a press in Readymade, but doesn’t seem to be what I need for setting type. Does anyone know a place where I can find plans for such a device?\n\nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/type%201_4189.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/type%202_3813.jpg)\n\n [‹ making digital look like film?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43501 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [more font awareness ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43315 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Are you sure you wouldn’t rather just buy a small tabletop press like [C&P](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533/http:/www.boxcarpress.com/flywheel/manuals/cp-pilot-manual.pdf) or [Kelsey](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533/http:/www.boxcarpress.com/flywheel/manuals/kelsey-printers-guide.pdf)? You can get them [pretty cheaply nowadays](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533/http:/www.briarpress.org/classifieds/browse?t=38). Then again, if you are crafty with your hands, you can try [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533/http:/www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Letterpress-&-Use-It-to-Print-Things/).\n\nLastly, [http://briarpress.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042533/http:/briarpress.org/ \"http://briarpress.org\") is an excellent resource for all things letterpress.
