  "content": "A client I’m working with on a Quark file hasn’t been able to load Financial-Avenir Heavy into his Suitcase. We’re going back and forth on this file, and (among other fonts) have been using Financial-Avenir Book with no problem. However, when I sent him the latest file along with the fonts, he said his suitcase rejected the font when he tried to load it(!) I’ve never heard of this, can anybody help? He seems to think it’s a Quark issue, seems more like a Suitcase issue to me. Anybody?\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Converting OpenType to AAT; Replacing mark-to-xxx?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012162415/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17314 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Adding language/hyphenation dictionaries to InDesign ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012162415/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17681 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
