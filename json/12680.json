I’ve never had occasion to use it, but I’ve kept it in mind ever since taking note of its use in both New York and GQ magazines (if I remember correctly) because of its legibility and pleasant, rounded character. There are 14 styles both for text and display. I tend towards san serifs for most of my work, and I’ve never really had to contend with many pages with lots of text, but I remember Miller specifically because I read the two aforementioned magazines and liked the way the body copy read, so I called the design departments to inquire what the font was.\n\n"

Large family with plenty of laternates and ornaments.\n\nSophisto - play together nicely with Delicato as a headline typeface. Also large family  \nwith lots of dingbats, signs etc. Stalemate could very well be an option.\n\n"

Their design philosophy of purposely designing idiosyncracies in individual letters makes them particularly suitable to display settings; it goes without saying that they work well in text settings.\n\nAlso recommended are Jonathan Hoefler’s Hoefler Text (used quite a bit by Robert Valentine) and Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones’ Mercury (designed for Esquire Magazine; with hints of New Century Schoolbook and Fleischman).\n\nRather than “Delicato,” I would suggest Jeremy Tankard’s Enigma, which Delicato strongly references.
