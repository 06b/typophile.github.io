  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI originally typeset a role-playing game (yeah, sort of like Dungeons and Dragons) 5 years ago that I wish to refresh with a new edition. I have considerably more knowledge about the ins and outs of typesetting and am pretty sure I can do a better job now. :)\n\nThe original book used Palatino, but I adjusted the width to 92.5%. I really love how Palatino reads, and it has a more playful vitality than most Serif alternatives. However, it's a space hog, and this is how I dealt with it.\n\nI've tried Palatino's text companion, Aldus, but it just doesn't read as nicely to me. Is adjusting a font's width a real faux pas? Or is a certain amount justifiable, and if so, how much?\n\n",
