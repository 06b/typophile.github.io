Century wasn’t too far off, apparently:  \n<cite>This revival of the Bruce Foundry’s No. 11 is typical of the nineteenth century types derived from the work of Didot and Bodoni; the face remains popular with lawyers and government printers. In fact, Theodore Low De Vinne opposed this kind of design as hard to print and read; he had Century designed to replace it.</cite>  \n(From the MyFonts description.)\n\nThanks, Patty!\n\n"
