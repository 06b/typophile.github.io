Spending a day to understand how to “ignore a substitute” (from FontLab manual) but nothing!!! Any help for the complete idiot?\n\nKonstantinos Siskakis  \nAnagrafi  \nGreece\n\n",

      "content": "Speaking of those 'ignore sub' statements: Within any lookup in a features file (which often means within a feature, unless you've specified lookups within a feature), scanning stops at the first match. So, in OpenType layout, if 'sub f i by f\\_i' matches, then that substitution is made, and everything in the lookup after that is ignored/skipped. The 'ignore sub' statements function exactly like any other 'sub' statement in this regard, except that instead of performing a substitution, nothing is done.\n\nSo, the statement 'ignore sub x f' i' by f\\_i' can be read as \"if f and i is preceded by x, do nothing.\" This is a match, like everything else, and subsequent lines in the lookup are skipped.\n\nDon't know if that actually helps! :)\n\n"
