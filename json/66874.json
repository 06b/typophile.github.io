  "content": "I'm looking for a clean font that is equivalent to FF Trixie. I love the option of FF Magda to choose between a distressed or a clean version. Unfortunately, FF Magda is too techno-ish for my purpose.  \nI tried a lot of Typewriter Fonts, but everything i could find was close, but not the same as a clean FF Trixie would look like. Different serifs, kerning, etc.\n\nAny idea? FontBook shows a \"Typewriter\" Font. Unfortunately without any reference to designer or foundry. And googling \"Typewriter\" is, well, you know…\n\n",
