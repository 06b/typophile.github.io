The best you can do is suggest a typeface at a certain size, but you need to accomodate the fact that anyone can change the typeface and size as they personally see fit.   \n   \nIf you're OK having text just 'disapear' then wrap the text in a fixed-sized div with overflow set to hidden.\n\n"

Ideally I'd like truncate the text with an ellipses after a certain number of characters, so it wouldn't have to be 100% accurate... but I'd be okay with an html/css solution (which I'm also not having much luck with) that just makes the text go bye bye after x pixels.   \n   \nAnyway, thanks again.\n\n"
