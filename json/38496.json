      "content": "Elam’s book on grid systems is excellent, but not worth much on it’s own as it explores how objects function within grids without really explaining the geometry that goes into really building good grids in the first place. The Rabinowitz book is a textbook in a traditional sense. It is a long survey of typography covering everything from font history to page layout to font design. All of the text is very dumbed-down, but I find that to be the strong point of the book, because it has none of the excesses and pretense that clutter up most of the books in this category, particularly those easily purchased in the United States. The downside is that, being a mass-market textbook, the design is just plain ugly and a segue of some sort is randomly assorted into every chapter. It also wastes a tremendous amount of space on specimens of the same common typefaces that get shown in one typography book after another.\n\nThe two books would actually make a pretty good pair.\n\n"

It is not as much logo as lettering, and font design is included in the latter.\n\n"
