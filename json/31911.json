I own the first and seconds publications and they are a great source of inspiration to me, loads of great packaging designs from the 60's which easily associate with todays trends.\n\nyou could try looking for them here\n\n[www.abebooks.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023005420/http:/www.abebooks.com/ \"www.abebooks.com\")\n\n[http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&y=0&tn=Graphis+Packa...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023005420/http:/www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&y=0&tn=Graphis+Packaging&x=0 \"http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&y=0&tn=Graphis+Packaging&x=0\")\n\nWhat I also find useful is just to take a day out and look round supermarkets or other similar stores. I was in Waitrose the other day and they had a number or really well designed products.\n\n"
