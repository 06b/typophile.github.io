But I know Adobe was encouraging Pagemaker users to switch to InDesign a couple of years ago... [They had (or have) some sort of discount if you switched/upgraded to InDesign.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821131023/http:/www.adobe.com/products/pagemaker/) Besides, they stopped upgrading PM after version 7, if I’m not mistaken.\n\n"

Hmmm? I’ve done an awful lot of work with it and, quite frankly, typography and design have nothing to do with software. I’ve handset a lot of books in metal type as well so I think I could suggest that the execution of typography and design are also hardly dependent upon the newer than the newest technology.\n\nI do love working with InDesign (never liked Illustrator) but I can certainly do my work without it if need be.\n\nGerald\n\n"

I’ve saved files with and without PDF compatibility before and the size reduction from saving without PDF compatibility has been huge sometimes—I remember one file was almost 18 megs with the PDF crap attached and without it went down to under a couple megs. But if you save without the PDF compatibility you also lose the icon preview in the OS so it’s one or the other.
