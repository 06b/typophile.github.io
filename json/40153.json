(Linux wasn’t included.)\n\nI know from my own attempts to compile such lists that they are error-prone and incomplete, but this is a good addition to the list of lists. If you can’t find a font you need for a general-interest Web site there, are you really trying? (Then again, you might go with Arial.)\n\n [‹ Type Composition Primer?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007180301/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40058 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Ignorance is bliss? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007180301/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40079 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’s astonishing how hard it is to find definitive lists of what fonts are installed with which applications and operating systems.\n\nWhat I’d love to see as a next step with the matrix I compiled is a tool for automatically creating font stacks. For instance, type in “Clarendon” and it automatically spits out something like “font-family: ’Clarendon Std’, ’Century Old Style Std’, ’Century Schoolbook’, Georgia, serif”.\n\n"
