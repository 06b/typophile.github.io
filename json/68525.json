I know the actual font was designed exclusively so I can't use it, so would like to know of anything similar.\n\nMany thanks,  \nDavid\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012041020im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font_3550.png)\n\n",

Priori serif has some of that feel.\n\n"

That pseudo medieval feel is just totally amateurish. I seem to remember the Ww's are back to front.\n\nYou'd be better off using anything else in a similar vein.\n\n"
