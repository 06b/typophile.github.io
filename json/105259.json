      "content": "Hi Satori, thanks for the tips. I had tried a different Q earlier, but it had worse legibility. I'll play around with it to see if I can help it, but I do like the unorthodox shape. I'll rework the 4 and 9, and now that I'm really studying it after a few days, I think the midline of the 5 is too high as well.\n\nAs far as lowercase is concerned, I was planning on repeating the capitals across the lowercase, perhaps as small caps. For some reason, I can't see attractive and wide lowercase forms, and the intent for the uppercase was mainly titling. I'll continue to evaluate and post updates here.\n\nConrad\n\n"

      "content": "Instead of changing the Q, I would rather have a take on the J. When we tend to accept that I does not need to be widened to fit in an extended typeface, wy should J suffer from that? The horizontal stroke is already too much for a proper J. Maybe you could try to extend the J below the baseline with a curvature similar to the tail of the Q. As a consequence you might then also consider to give the diagonal strokes of K (down right only) and R. Which could be taken further of course. When this does not fit your original concept (too much curvature?) you might also consider to create two different designs :–)\n\n"

A few random observations:\n\nB suffers from the [\"bone effect\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021822/http:/66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.06.illusion.htm) and needs to be optically compensated. Also the join of the two bowls appears too dark. (D could also use some similar correction, even if it's not as obvious there.)\n\nO needs more overhang.\n\nX looks slightly top-heavy.\n\nC has some strange curves going on, especially the top one. Also, it seems out of style with the easy geometricism of a lot of the other characters, and its terminals are different from G/S. (If that's intentional, what's the rationale?)\n\nS probably needs to be gone over curve-wise as well, doesn't feel entirely smooth and leans back slightly.\n\nDoes I have a thicker stem than the other characters? If so, why?\n\nWhy is the stem off-centre in the exclamation mark?\n\n"

      "content": "Albert & Johan,\n\nThanks for the tips and links (very handy). I've been tweaking this face non stop since I posted it here first. Below is the current standing. I won't post the current state of the lowercase, as it will need a significant overhaul on a number of glyphs as I apply your comments to the uppercase. I feel that the current version of the C is much more inline with the overall feel of the face, and I will be changing the B (I expect the P and R are also suffering the bone effect) and reëvaluating the J, K and R.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021822im_/http:/typophile.com/files/round2-typo_6390.png)\n\nSatori, the numbers are for you. I've revamped the 8 & 5, and the 4 & 9 are both more fitting with the rest of the widths.\n\n"

The {s} and {2} are a bit flabby, maybe remove the plateau in the spines. The {S} doesn't have that problem, but the upper and lower bend are very different from each other — try giving it a more continuous curve. The {t} looks comically unbalanced to me. It'd keep its ascender and backward spur to a bare minimum, and give it a more grounded foot.\n\nLove the numbers and the {Q}!\n\n"
