There are more versions of this typeface which move in closer and the letterforms become intertwined within one another becoming unreadable establishing a sense of privacy for the writer and the letters they write.   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024003541im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28848.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "My typeface comes in five different variations, \"Community Privacy 1\" to \"Community Privacy 5.\" Each variation has its own suitcase listed seperately in the list of fonts. I came about the system as I studied different codes and rating systems, such as the terrorist alert warnings, sex offender ratings, gaming system ratings, movie ratings, braille, etc. I decided as to label my fonts with a basic numbering system of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. As a person feels their message is non-readable a person would type with \"Community Privacy 5\" and so on. This is mostly based off movie and gaming system ratings with a reference to the sex offender numbering.\n\n"
