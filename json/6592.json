A basic package, comparable to Fontographer 2.0 in scope, will cost $449 for a private license. That is, the user cannot make fonts for sale. However, he can prepare fonts and logos for in-house use. Hint-insertion tools are an extra $750; the Optical Scaling module is a $1,000 option.   \n   \nCommercial font designers must pay a much higher price: $55,000 plus a royalty of $3.40 per face. Alternative licenses, trading off the up-front fee for higher royalties, may also be negotiated.\"   \n   \nPerhaps if it were under $50,000 it might be worth looking into.\n\n",

It's not as if Morris Fuller Benton himself wrote any of the code.   \n   \n [Jens Alfke](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010194258/http:/mooseyard.com/Jens/2004/04/jenss-tangled-job-history) worked on the software. Maybe it's worth asking him about it. There's also a bit of an ad blurb by [Henry Schneiker](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010194258/http:/members.aol.com/willadams/typetech.txt).   \n   \nI'm also not really sure we need to understand exactly how ATF Type Designer accomplished its optical scaling. Adobe manages to crank out their share of optically scaled fonts, using Multiple Master technology at least internally, if not for release. Also, the landmark Metafont system (part of TeX) is capable of optical scaling, and the free Computer Modern fonts are optically scaled. Metafont is amazingly sophisticated, but unfortunately requires the equivalent of a computer science PhD to use effectively. I think a middle ground is possible - a highly interactive, visual tool that's powerful enough to make good optical scaling, but relatively simple to work with and not anywhere nearly as labor-intensive as current methods of optical scaling.\n\n"

We obtained ATF Type Designer on an evaluation basis and never actually used it for production. One of the reasons we were able to play with it was because we were licensing a ton of designs from ATF/Kingsley for the Image Club library. There were trying to get us hooked into supporting some of their attempts at 'diversifiction'. The multi-thousand dollar commercial license that Richard mentions above would have certainly been out of the question for Image Club during that time. We were a dyed-in-the-wool Fog shop from day one.\n\n"

      "content": "I had a brief email exchange with Jens. He didn't do the optical scaling; that was probably Henry Schneiker. He was able to tell me that it was based on stroking and filling, rather than interpolation.   \n   \nI can come to some tentative conclusions, then. I think the characters were drawn in PostScript code by defining a path (moveto lineto curveto), then doing a gsave fill grestore stroke sequence. My strong guess is that the outlines were drawn at the largest optical scaling size (i.e. thinnest, most delicate features), then positive gain added for smaller sizes. Of course, in the Benton matrix engraver, you have a combination of positive and negative gain (erosion). It's possible, but rather difficult, to do erosion in PostScript code.   \n   \nBecause I am a curious sort, I hacked up some Type3 fonts to apply gain in this way to existing (Type1) fonts. The optical scaling results are pretty good, but I don't think the technique would work very well in production. Most importantly, optical scaling has profound effects on the metrics, and the Type3 approach has no way to communicate the adjustments to metrics to the layout application. Type3 fonts are notorious for flakiness and other problems; I'm not even going to post my file because it renders differently on the different PostScript interpreters I have available.   \n   \nApplying the ATF Bodoni scaling parameters to modern fonts yielded mixed results. The effects of optical scaling looked a bit heavy-handed to my eyes, especially in the 6pt size range. Some fonts looked great (most especially, my draft of the Centaur caps), while othersl, especially Helvetica, looked low-fi. The 'e' in Helvetica doesn't optically scale well using this technique, because it tends to close the aperture even more. I find it quite plausble that the fonts in the ATF catalog were explicitly designed to scale nicely using the Benton techniques.   \n   \nIn any case, my curiosity about the Kingsley/ATF software is now satisfied. I think I have a pretty good idea how to take these basic ideas and do them right, especially so they'll work well with modern software and processes. Even if the Kingsley software produced stunningly beautiful results (for which I have not yet seen any evidence), it is obviously not capable of grinding out OpenType's with optical scaling features, so that the Right Thing just happens in InDesign.\n\n"

In the case of the ATF Bodonis, the descenders do get shorter as the font scales down, but I think that it's mostly done by adjustments in the pantograph, not by multiple pattern plates. For pqj, I think they just translated up the pattern plate while cutting the descender, and for gy I think they did nonuniform scaling.   \n   \nHa! Now I can make a point actually relevant to the thread. If what Jens told me is true about Kingsley/ATF optical scaling being based on adding a stroke rather than interpolation or any other Metafont-like manipulation of the coordinates, then it almost certainly lacked the ability to do scaling adjustments like pq in ATF Bodoni.   \n   \nIn any case, my analysis (from the same source as yours) yields four ranges: 6-9, 10-12, 14-24, and 30-72. The most obvious \"tell\" is the comma; the 14-24 design in particular is quite distinct. Other more subtle tells are the left serif of the u (angle varies) and the top curve of the f. For the smallest sizes, the clearest tell is the top bit of the t; it extends farther above the crossbar, which is the opposite of what you'd expect from simply raising the x-height.   \n   \nI haven't fully figured out what's going on the 6 and 8pt sizes yet, except to note that the 8 looks considerably lighter than the 6 or the 9 (arguably a failure of optical scaling; it's very hard to find an example of this kind of lack of consistency anywhere in the ATF books), and that the 6pt has really short extenders.   \n   \nI found some curious defects, too. Check out the nick in the e at 11:30 in the 48pt size, the too-small 36pt o, and the broken Q tail at 42 and 72. I found some other subtle curve problems as well.

My guess is that this too was a space saving technique, since ligated text is more compact than unligated.

I did talk to the Adobe type manager when it first came out and all he would say was he had problems loading it. So did I. It never seemed to have actually worked for anyone that I know.   \n   \nGotta say though, as I recall, the manual had some good introductory info in it. Must have been a day of lunacy when I tossed it. Maybe I was thinking better things were coming down along the old type road. Hah!   \n   \nGerald\n\n"

      "content": "Hey all   \n   \nThis is my first post here - and possibly my only post, given the tenor of some of the comments I have been reading tonight - but as I think I am probably unique on this list in that I own both a Benton Engraving Machine AND the Optical Scaling module for ATF Type Designer, I thought I might weigh in with a snippet of clarification and a couple of other comments.   \n   \n1. ATF released the OpScale module integrated into Release 1.5 of their software. I have a feeling this was not a general release, and I further believe that any potential plans for its release were shelved when the company began to flounder so spectacularly. I have tried unsuccessfully to make use of it several times, but - as Henry Schneiker pointed out to me when I bought him a meal here in about 1993 - the information the module expects is directly related to ATF's original cutting slips. These slips are slippery beasts; I have never seen one, and I suspect most of them went into the many and copious bins apparently lined up outside ATF on the day of the infamous auction. Henry further pointed out that these cutting slips were in no way standardised, and that interpreting them required a personal and particular familiarity with the typeface being cut, the slips used to record that typefaces's cutting schedule, and the actual machine itself used to cut the matrices or punches. That is, one workman's notes were another workman's nonsense.   \n   \nI recall Henry mentioning cutter/follower sizes and ratios, sliding scales, expansions and contractions, etc; all the things you'd expect if you are familiar with the processes involved. I also recall him saying that without the cutting slips the OpScale module was essentially useless, that it was designed to allow ATF's staff to enter existing information when digitising their extant designs rather than develop tables for new faces. And that has been my experience.   \n   \nI am unfortunately completely unqualified to comment on the underlying mathematics, although Henry described it minute detail. He also showed me some tricky (read: baffling) semi-interactive postscript where a character outline was modified disproportionately depending on some variables I didn't fully grasp. I remember wondering if it was similar to the way Metafont did its magic, but didn't get a chance to ask.   \n   \n2. Someone said: 'the 6pt has really short extenders'...   \n   \nI believe that this was done for purely practical reasons, and without any consideration at all for the intended use of the type. This extreme shortening of extenders, which is generally to be seen most prominently below about 8-point, is required to maximise x-height. This is supported further by the fact that usually it is the descenders which suffer the most, an explicit acknowledgement of and concession to the dominant role played by the upper half of a character image in maintaining readability. It is entirely feasible (and has been done, see Cancellaresca Bastarda for one example) to cast a size of type on a larger body as standard release. (And I don't mean, '6-point on a 7-point body'; that's a typographer's specification rather than a founder's.) But when foundries sell 6-point type, they're selling 6-point type, not 7-point, so they make the design fit a 6-point body; and they sacrifice the least important part, the descenders. I think that considerations of use, such as solid setting for subsidiary matter, are of consequential rather than primary significance.   \n   \n3. Regarding 'discolouration' in size-series.   \n   \nIt's pertinent to remember that foundries occasionally released versions and sizes of types without regard to the tonal contiguity of their neighbours. These apparent discontiguities were simply the result of variants which had been cut for a specific reason and were thus out of the normal series or progression, but which were sometimes shown in the specimens regardless. I had a conversation with David Saunders of Monotype a decade ago and brought up this very issue, and that was his response.   \n   \n4. 'Most probably to make mixing different sizes/fonts on the same line a lot easier.'   \n   \nThis is never easy, ever. You should try it on your adana!   \n   \n5. And lastly, it's plain silly to say that Monotype's drawing or production quality was inferior to ATF's; you could argue the toss either way and no-one would win. And to blame this imagined inferiority on the fact that Monotype was running a business...no, sorry, that's right, ATF was a charity; I'd forgotten. Both companies produced solid designs and superb types. You can't take seriously any criticism of 'types' based on their printed images alone; or not these kinds of criticisms, anyway. \"And ATF were indeed better...\" Uh-huh.   \n   \nAll the best.   \n   \nNick   \n   \nps. I have chosen 'mr\\_benton' for my username, but after reading through some of the forums, it really seems that Mr Giampa is the real mr\\_benton, and that I am merely a pale imposter. If you get around to reading this, Mr Giampa, I would appreciate it very much if you would contact me off-list at your convenience. I feel we may have a few things to discuss. Or, rather, that I desperately desire someone to talk BEM with. Thanks\n\n"

We're lucky - please don't leave! :-)   \n   \nReading your most revealing post, one thing I realize is that tracking down the cutting slips is probably a waste of time. Reverse-engineering from the actual fonts seems better.   \n   \nBut let me ask:   \nWhat are the chances we can get Henry Schneiker on board?   \n   \n\\> it's plain silly to say that Monotype's drawing or production quality was inferior to ATF's   \n   \nJust last night I was setting and printing ATF and Monotype cuts of Baskerville. The difference in quality (of the alloy, the face depth, and certainly the fitting\\*) is staggering. Sorry. The one aspect where the Monotype is better however is that it has trapping - which I think is telling, considering the [probable] greater reliance on the pantograph at ATF.   \n   \n\\* For example, the Monotype's \"j\" has an elephantine left sidebearing, predictably.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Nick,   \n   \n Thanks very, very much for your comments, which add much light to the questions I'm struggling with. I certainly hope this is not your last post.   \n   \n I'm definitely not trying to make a blanket statement about the relative quality of ATF and Monotype fonts; while the particular data points I've seen seem to favor ATF, I'm sure the real story is a lot more complicated. Of course, since my main sources are the printed specimen books, there are a great many variables other than the quality of the type itself. Indeed, I believe that the 1912 and 1923 ATF books are notable largely for the insane attention to detail in printing quality. It's rare to find an instance of an objective technical flaw such as a broken hairline, misaligned baseline, etc.   \n   \n I have, by looking at these printed samples, inferred quite a bit about the optical scaling \"algorithms\" used by ATF. I am excited about the possibility of adapting these algorithms to the digital world. One of the things I'd like to do soon is write up my findings so far, especially so that people who know more about metal type will be able to tell me what I'm missing. I would be honored to have you look over a draft of this paper, if you're so willing.\n\n"
