      "content": "A excerpt from our concept presentation:\n\n_… This concept is an intriguing play on the acronym WCC. This is the boldest statement of the four (concepts), immediately evoking the Bauhaus aesthetic quite often associated with large corporations. Primary messaging is sophisticated and strong, establishing sound business practice above all else. The rounded corners on the bounding box help soften the impact slightly, and provide an ergonomic, humanistic quality that eases user interaction. The emphasis on the ‘W’ evokes/reinforces ‘winning.’ …_\n\nWCC is a sports forecasting/handicapping company. The two founding officers are sports experts. They appear regularly on ESPN, as commentators and sports (mailing western coast college conference) forecasters.\n\nOne of the major brand touch points will actually be athletic wear, and mid range apparel — think nice trendy polos, not t-shirts. There is going to be a big guerilla marketing push with the apparel. We are taking some rather un-conventional approaches to marketing within a market that is quite staunch and sterile. The majority of the competitors are quite ‘old fashioned’ and extremely unimaginative.\n\nA major criterion for success was the ability to become a quazi-fashion label. Something people would enjoy wearing. A mark that would be able to facilitate a trend, yet remain timeless.\n\nThe applications will be fairly broad. One of the most interesting touch points is the apparel. One of the more difficult touch points is the radio.\n\n"

I think there’s only one reason on the ground: it goes against the current graphic design culture of appearing sophisticated to other graphic designers (which sucks). In contrast, below is a logo that I saw last weekend; it put a smile on my face, and made a strong impression in my mind, even though I’m “aware” of graphic design (but I’m not jaded by it).\n\n[http://themicrofoundry.com/other/ufish.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522104557/http:/themicrofoundry.com/other/ufish.jpg)\n\nSure, I’d definitely get rid of the waves, and possibly the splash drops too, but essentially I believe it’s the type of thing that **works** , no matter how much most graphic designers in black turtlenecks would snort at it.\n\nhhp\n\n"

The point of it is that you have one reaction at your first viewing and yet another reaction at some later viewing. This one, two punch acts synergistically to aid retention. It also can prompt discussion between viewers who otherwise would just have gone by after the first viewing. There is a lot of work involved in getting it right. It has nothing to do with art—it is by design.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

But I don’t think laymen ever get that second reaction in the case of the FedEx logo - unless maybe if they a graphic designer as a close friend. I’m not saying the arrow should have a neon sign delineating it; but it should have been made to become visible to the layman eventually. Art vs Craft: if a graphic designer is more concerned with expressing his self/talents/skills, he becomes closer to Art than Craft.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I see “letters and arrow” on one level of focus, and “truck and letters” on another, but I don’t see “truck and arrow” as a relationship the way I might otherwise. It’s like the difference between a big map painted on the floor and a paper map opened in front of me on the table. In the first case, it would bother me if north were not truly pointed north; in the other case, it would not, because there is no strongly implied relationship to its surroundings as context.\n\n"
