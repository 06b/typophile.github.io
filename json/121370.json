Looks like a [Spoleto/Aktuelle/Athletic Script/Opti Sport Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425043539/http:/typophile.com/node/70274) x [Beaurencourt](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425043539/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontyou/beaurencourt-fy) job. Some alternatives: **Vellum/Swoon** (interesting but don't want to give any pointer to it as it's copyrighted by Summitsoft Corporation and I don't trust this source although I can't find any other \"trusty\" source for it), [Dausby](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425043539/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/corien/dausby), [Enrico Handwritting](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425043539/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/enrico-handwriting), many [IHOF P22](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425043539/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/IHOF)\n\n"

[Castro Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425043539/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/castro-script/), [Society Editor](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425043539/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/society-editor/) and [Dollie Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425043539/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/dollie-script/). It's quite possible the original script is just the designers own handwriting.\n\n"
