If you can use Fontshop it's easy. Use the parallel line tool to make something that looks like this \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143452im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinside_5713.jpg)\n  \nMerge the contours. \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143452im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideMergedContours_4487.jpg)\n Delete everything except the segment that will form one side of your inline curve.\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143452im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideDeleteAll%20ButContour_5924.jpg)\n Break this contour at the short side and convert to lines. \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143452im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideBreakContour_6740.jpg)\n  \nDo the same thing to make the other side.  \nJoin the two segments so as to make the correct length.\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143452im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideJoinSegments_4138.jpg)\n Merge contours and delete all but the final inline portion. \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143452im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideFinalInline_4306.jpg)\n Place into the letter. \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143452im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ITCBodoni72InlineTestCurvedLetterDinsideFinalLetter_5728.jpg)\n  \nDon\n\n"

I was hoping I wasn't going to have to manually create the font but it seems I am going to have to. I wish there was a way I could add the fonts to photohop so I only have to do the work once and I could use the fonts over and over.\n\nI don't have font creation software :-(\n\nThank You again for your brain power!\n\n"
