The book was _Cultural Breaks: A Collection of Short Fictions_, by Brian Aldiss, published by Tachyon Publications in San Francisco. (I only did the interior; the dust jacket was designed by someone else.) Since Aldiss is a literary science-fiction author and lives in Oxford, it seemed appropriate to use a typeface with English roots; but the real point wasn't where it was designed, but what effect it gave on the page while you were reading. I wasn't sure at first that Jeremy's italic would work here; it's nearly a slanted roman, with just a few cursive touches, and one of the stories had extensive passages in italic. But in fact the Kingfisher italic proved very readable, yet still different enough in structure to stand out in the occasional italicized word in running text.\n\nThe strong color made the pages easily read, even while the letterforms had a certain refined elegance; just what I wanted for this particular book. I appreciated details like the italic small caps -- and the regular small caps are strong enough to stand out in short acronyms in the middle of text. Having Kingfisher as an OpenType font made all the difference in quick, efficient book production; I could, for instance, automate all those small caps by using a character style in InDesign.\n\nVery good book typeface. And the display version looked very nice at Really Big Size, too.\n\nJohn Berry\n\n"

I must say that this is a very tricky decision, from a type designer's point of view. For instance, if the price is high, the sales volume may be lower, but may be the same amount of money made by pricing low & selling many. Or maybe it will sell the same amount licences regardless of the price. And if the price is lower, does that mean that more folks can afford & use the typeface?\n\nI have a pet theory about high prices of type, that you might like to hear. If the price of a typeface is extremely higher than average, then those who buy it will consider it more of an investment than, say, a $20 special from MyFonts. Because they paid such a high price, they will be very unwilling to pirate the fonts about as well, as it devalues their own investment. And as we all know, a high price immediately makes us think that it is so much better than a cheaper alternative, like most luxury brands.\n\nBut, having said all this, the ultimate decision is by the seller. If they price high, then so be it. If you can't afford it now, then save up & buy it when you can, if you really want it.

Every purchaser of type has that pricing \"sweet-spot\" of quality and price which we all seek to find, but in some cases there are no adequate substitutes or equivalents. For me over $100 a style is way too much. After that, I have to look for ways to justify it. If I can't, then I will keep looking and waiting. Not to say I haven't done so. I have spent $100 on a single Type1 font and will do so soon too. The design I purchased is _supremely_ better (that's right- I said supremely) than all others that have attempted the revival so I'm happy to have spent that kind of money. I always place quality first when shopping for type. Then price.\n\nBut excellent book workhorses? These can be found all over the place for less money. Will these alternatives be as good as Kingfisher- maybe. Will these be better- maybe. Could Kingfisher be the best font on the planet?... perhaps not to me, but I'm glad that those who have ponyed up to buy it, enjoy it very much. Perhaps a reason for Typewiz to purchase it.\n\nWhat I find so great about a free market is, if I think your prices are too high; there is (most of the time) some other type designer who will offer the same things for less money, or more things for the same money; and that person will get my business. Look at the beautiful Miller from Font Bureau and the \"pragmatic\" Chronicle from HF&J- not the same, but both for news- both very well done. I would not be surprised if Miller's sales have slide a bit because of the tremendous value put into the HF&J package. (personally I'm a Miller man myself but anyway...)\n\nAs buyers of type we need to always need to do our due diligence when it comes to making purchase decisions (as Typewiz is). I think we need to remember that Typewiz thinks the price is a little expensive (I agree with him). Maybe he'll buy it, maybe he won't. I'm sure the positive feedback (and his checkbook) will help him decide.\n\nI like what Yves said about the cars. Although I would have bought something Japanese :-)\n\nAll my best to Typewiz and everybody else too,\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\nAs a side note- Kris's Feijoa looks like another great choice for text! Its absolutely beautiful. If Typewiz is not sold on Kingfisher, Feijoa would make a fabulous selection. It certainly feels luxurious and does not look like \"cheaper alternative\" even though is seriously well priced! Feijoa reminds me of a warm letterpress Coranto. Its complement of ligatures are more fun too (and it's about time someone does f í combinations- eastern europeans need ligatures too :-)\n\n"

Boy, am I a slow learner.\n\nSOME of the typophilles (and poseurs) here bristle at free fonts, justify high prices, demand quality in a font or website **unless** it's one of your own, then you piss and moan and howl about me and people like me who have a champagne taste and a beer budget, and who expects professional types to be professional.\n\nWell, you professional types may think you can have it both ways, but the rest of us know better.\n\nThere's been a lot of trashing of MyFonts on this thread and others, and if you don't like it, don't buy there. There are some type designers, like Nick Shinn who sell their fonts there, and even though he's rather successful at selling proprietary fonts, he is still grateful for MyFonts.\n\nI refrained from stooping to Muzzer's level (if you can't attack the facts, resort to ad hominem arguments) hoping that someone else here would. He's the Sipro Agnew for all the Richard Nixon la-de-da upper crust types (or the Dick Cheney for you dubya la-de-da upper crust types) here.\n\nThose of you, who I otherwise consider class acts, in letting him get away with that kind of crap, demonstrate where you really stand.\n\nThose who think comparing fonts to cars are now in my territory. Any effin' idiot can design a world class car for $250,000 on up, but the REAL credit goes to those who can combine the best of all possible attributes in a car that sells for the masses.\n\nFor those who want to sell the Louis Vuitton or Ferrari equivalent of fonts at stratospheric prices, be my guest. It you want to try to try to thrive on exclusivity (\"if you have to ask, you can't afford it\") go ahead. But As I said before, if there are rip offs, don't come boo-hooin' to me. If you want sympathy, look in the dictionary.\n\nThe link between quality and price is tenuous at best. For those who are dedicated to their craft, and want to make a living at it, I salute you, and am willing to buy your fonts. (Shinn, Stone, Porchez, Degroot, Buivenga, and others.) For those who are a legend in your own minds, well you have enough supporters that anything I can say matters little.\n\n"

Any effin’ idiot can design a world class car for $250,000 on up, but the REAL credit goes to those who can combine the best of all possible attributes in a car that sells for the masses.</cite>\n\nThanks for clarifying! I think I now understand your earlier analogy. So is there an equivalent typeface to this car that that combines the best of all possible attributes and sells to the masses? The 6 new Vista typeface families? The myriad of typefaces that some with your computer? Helvetica? Times? How many cars do you need?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a fledgling type designer, I would like to say that pricing is never an easy thing, I doubt it is taken lightly by any retailers. For instance, after four years of work on Feijoa (yikes!), deciding that a price of $US 150 was almost heartbreaking. It would seem to be a monumental waste of time if it only sold once or twice. But if it did take off, then all those years of living hand-to-mouth would be worth it. I can understand the retailers who would just feel that pricing their work higher than 'average' is justified—all the customer sees is the final price, never the hours/days/years/decades that go into designing the typeface. I can also understand those who price lower than 'average' in order to (hopefully) increase sales.\n\nI would like to be very clear. The only reason that I am involved in this thread is to try and determine what is considered a fair price for typefaces. I am neither championing free fonts nor expensive ones, folks will do what they feel is right. To this end, Steve & others, may I ask you again:\n\nWhat is the ideal price range for a fully featured text typeface like Kingfisher? Can you please give us all examples of quality typefaces priced too cheaply, just right, and too expensive?\n\nThanks!\n\n—K\n\n"

You can check what I paid for that…\n\nAnd with the dollar taking a dive, American type is becoming really cheap!\n\nKris: Seriously, I think that the range of 30 to 50 $ per face and 150 to 300 per family is fair.

There really is no need to get all worked up over this.\n\nThe point I was trying to make is that I believe in the designers deciding for themselves which price is right for their typefaces, and the users to decide for themselves if they're willing to pay that price. It's all about self-determination, you know.\n\n\\> _But As I said before, if there are rip offs, don’t come boo-hooin’ to me. If you want sympathy, look in the dictionary._\n\nSo if I interpret your words correctly, theft of intellectual property is warranted if a designer sets his prices too high for your standards? Now _that_ is an intriguing ethical position. :^)\n\nAnd please don't put words in other people's mouths as if you can read their minds. Really, I'm cool with freeware fonts (at least the rare quality ones) and have been using some of them from time to time. I'm cool with cheap fonts, as I have licensed many. I'm cool with expensive fonts, as I have licensed few. But I'm not angry at Tankard for setting his prices as he deems correct: it really is not my business. And I certainly wouldn't accuse him of being \"a legend in [his] own mind\". Your comments come across as really bitter and acerbic. I fear they tell more about you than about those you call the \"la-de-da upper crust types\".\n\n"

Over-priced merchandise just invites it.\n\nKris: Fontin Sans is so good I'd buy it if it were not free. But I AM glad it was free. Recent purchases that fall into the \"just right\" category include Parisene Plus, TheSans Office, Cycles and Arepo (purchased at half-price from MyFonts), Goodchild (purchased at Fonts.com for $99 in TT), and Mrs. Eves. One price-related issue is not just how much a font costs, but bundling: forcing me to buy fonts I don't want, or weights I don't need in order to get the font or weights I want. Nueue Helvetica is one example; all House fonts are another. Because I think they are fairly priced and bundled, I'm considering Clearview Text and Berling Nova. And I really like Canada Type.\n\n"
