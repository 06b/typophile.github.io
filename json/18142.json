This is obviously more of a display face, not sure how legible it would be at small sizes. I look forward to your thoughts.  \nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [EPISTROPHY\\_CRIT.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123211128/http:/typophile.com/files/EPISTROPHY_CRIT.jpg) | 137.23 KB |\n\n",
