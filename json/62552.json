Please tell me if it doesn't work.\n\nThe people you see in these images face imminent genetic extinction and ongoing cultural erosion. For clarification, DNA migration may stem from outside tribes joining this tribe to evade western influence. There have also been accusations of brothel rape. You can see in the photographs that children do not share grandparent's physical traits. Only 155 surviving individuals reflect the ancestral appearance - most of whom are elders who have had their children.\n\nWhich typeface, and do you think any particular layout should be considered? :)\n\n",

I'm slightly familiar with the Batak people since my manager used to live in Sumatra and is married to a Batak woman.  \nI like the idea of choosing type that looks like a field report; but perhaps for captions only. I don't think Officina Sans works well for long text blocks â€” all those rectangular serifs get in the way for me.  \nI'm not sure if you're producing an academic essay, a trip report or something larger so I won't advise on layout.  \nI worked on a project a couple of years ago for an international peace organisation that was concerned with endangered communities in Colombia. I chose Dolly, which I chose for its feeling of humanity and compassion, and the fact I really like it. Not sure if that's very helpful ;)\n\n"
