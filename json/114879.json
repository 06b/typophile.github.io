  "content": "Hi,\n\nWondering if someone can help me out with identifying a font. I tried what the font and i've had a good look online. No luck.\n\nThe font I need the name of is within the Brisan Carriages logo at [www.brisancarriages.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317055933/http:/www.brisancarriages.co.uk/ \"www.brisancarriages.co.uk\") and the \"Carriages\" font. I think it would be a script font.\n\nThanks so much\n\nLee\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Storefront \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317055933/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

Appreciate it.\n\nI did think Carriages had been modified a lot which is probably why it didn't show up on \"what the font.\" Thanks for the suggested scrip fonts I'll have a close look at each one.\n\nWhat's hard is my client wants to use the font for the word \"prestige\" and I'm not sure if picking another scrip font would suffice. I may have to do some modifications as well I'm thinking.\n\nThanks again,  \nLee\n\n"
