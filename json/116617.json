      "content": "Edited -- second revision.  \nCampanile, a font patented by William W. Jackson as D11161 on April 15, 1879 and sold by MacKellar Smith's Jordan, and later by other foundries, under that name.  \nDan X. Solo made a digital version, 1998, in the CD sold with the Dover book Victorian Display Fonts. Other independent digitizationas are by Aridi, as Aridi 70., and by Walden as Jugend. There is also an OPTI version which MAY be original, and a version by Deiter Steffmann which is a rip of the OPTI version. No legitimate digital that I can show as a link. As for Campanile from Aridi, [http://www.aridi.com/images/fonts/70.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317152703/http:/www.aridi.com/images/fonts/70.gif \"http://www.aridi.com/images/fonts/70.gif\") for a display. It's not clear to me if you can purchase it separately from a big bundle.\n\nAlso worth reading the comment by Robert at [http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/76375/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317152703/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/76375/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/76375/\") reproduced here for convenience  \n---start quote--  \n...this typeface is Campanile originally cast by MacKellar, Smith and Jordan Type Foundry, not to be confused with Bodoni Campanile which was designed by Robert Hunter Middleton for Ludlow Typographic Company in the late 1930’s.  \nCampanile has been digitized by 3 people:  \nMr. Dan X. Solo: 24 Victorian Display Fonts with CD-Rom available from Dover Publications.  \nDieter Steffmann Fonts  \nAridi ( [www.aridi.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317152703/http:/www.aridi.com/ \"www.aridi.com\"))  \nYou can find a complete showing of Campanile in the following books:  \nVGC Alphabet Library (1973-1985)  \nVictorian Display Alphavets: 100 Complete Fonts  \nRyderTypes  \nYou can find these books at your local library or get them through interlibrary loan.  \nYours Truly,  \nRobert  \n---end quote---  \n[Link to Steffmann font deleted/Don]  \nDon\n\n"
