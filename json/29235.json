Like the [Venetian](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Venetian) types, this style is based on [calligraphic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/calligraphy) principles, including modulated [stroke](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/stroke), oblique axis, [adnate](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/adnate) serifs and modeled terminals, and moderate [aperture](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/aperture). The Garalde [italics](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/italic) are closely associated with their corresponding [roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/roman) fonts and are designed to be used together with them in a subordinate role.\n\nSee also [Garalde Typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Garalde%20Typefaces).\n\n",
