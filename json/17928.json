  "content": "I am interested in obtaining a font library/collection and would like to hear from some of you the pros/cons of the various choices. Basically, I have the a good many of the workhorse fonts from the Adobe collection, but would like to purchase either it in its entirety, or another better collection. I have looked at the Linotype collection, as many of my friends have it, but am not sure if this is the best choice either. Personally, I am more interested in fonts that are finely tuned design wise, and typesetting wise, for texts, not really display or other applications. I searched the rest of the threads about the font collections, and read what was said, but it seems that nobody ever really discussed the quality of any of these libraries/collections, and how they differ from each other. This is the information that I am interested in. The monetary concerns are not something of focus at this point, for I would merely like to here about the design and quality of the typography and not how much I will have to spend in order to obtain it. Quantity is nice, but quality is always necessary.\n\n [‹ sidebearings in FOG](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109060752/http:/typophile.com/node/18215 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Bickham Script ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109060752/http:/typophile.com/node/18124 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Much better to go to somewhere like FontShop — where they have a huge selection of many foundries — and find some good solid families from different places.\n\n"

      "content": "While I dislike the company itself,  \nBerthold Types (not nice in any way) has some great fonts, always technically advanced and beautiful letters and spacing. When the diatronic was around, the letters/spacing were better than everybody else, but the danged machine hosed almost all users, which really caused their downfall. If postscript were 5 years older, Berthold would still be in Germany. They do not have all these late great (read this SUCKY) flash in the pan fonts, but who has a better font than Formata? Caslon? Berthold Deepdene?  \nOh yeah, the BQ fonta are what you want, not the BE fonts that went with Adobe Library, cause the Kerning is as limp wristed as they come.  \nAll the best,  \nRodrigue  \nThe Truth shall set you free\n\n"
