The font family [Olivegreen Mono](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055433/http:/www.schriftgestaltung.de/index.php?inhalt=Schriften&seite=OlivegreenMono) is available immediately from [MyFont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055433/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/schriftgestaltung/olive-green-mono). The rather upright geometric design of the monospace font is contrasted with the very vibrant, playful italic that contains the interesting element of the as of yet unpublished favorite “Grayblue Sans” and that is anything else but a “waste product”. This becomes most obvious when considering the fact that OliveGreen Mono™ is available in eight different weights [Light, Regular, Medium, Bold and the corresponding Italics]. In addition, numerous open type functions are integrated, also containing all common language regions [Western, Baltic, Turkish, Central European]. The font is particularly well suited as a screen font.\n\nAll fonts by Georg Seifert are going to be named after colors.\n\nSchriftgetaltung.de [germ, Typedesign] is a small foundry that published fonts by Georg Seifert and offers a platform for friends to present their own fonts.\n\n- Specimen: [Schriftgestaltung.de/seite/Schriften/OliveGreenMonoSpezimen.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055433/http:/www.schriftgestaltung.de/seite/Schriften/OliveGreenMonoSpezimen.pdf)\n- Purchase: [MyFonts.com/fonts/schriftgestaltung/olive-green-mono](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055433/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/schriftgestaltung/olive-green-mono)\n- Georg Seifert’s Website: [reets.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055433/http:/www.reets.de/)\n\n",
