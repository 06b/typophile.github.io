On typophile, there are several [forums](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416175244/http:/www.typophile.com/forums). I think this topic would rather fit into the [Design board](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416175244/http:/www.typophile.com/forum/5), as it doesn’t deal with educational concerns.\n\nWhat kind of application are you looking for? Newspaper fonts, (urban) display fonts, book typography?  \nWhat place and culture, United States? Prohibition and Al Capone? Jazz, Swing, Broadway? Art Deco, Art Nouveau or expressionism?  \nNarrowing this down might help us.\n\nYou can always browse font vendor sites for keywords, like:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/1920s/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416175244/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/1920s/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/1920s/\")\n\nF\n\n"

      "content": "wikipedia will prove useful.\n\nMany of our modern typefaces were designed earlier than we thought they were.\n\nI believe:\n\nGill Sans  \nFutura  \n \\*possibly\\* Cooper\n\nwere designed in the 1920's, although they didn't gain momentum till they were used for a while.\n\nIf you're looking for typefaces that were popular in the 1920's, you'd have to look for typefaces that were designed much much earlier. Due to the technology of the time, they could make for quick and easy distribution like we can with digital downloads the day after they're created.\n\n"
