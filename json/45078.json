Now on my new computer, I’m editing and getting the “font not available” message—but I have no idea what either of these fonts is. I do know that the title font (“Sampling”) has an Alien effect on it. Anyone know what either font is, or both?\n\nThanks,  \nStevie\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173748im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/home2_6036.jpg)\n\n [‹ OBEY](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173748/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45045 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [ID: Spurred \"3\" ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173748/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45076 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
