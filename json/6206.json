Illegal graffiti in big Builds   \nFor example, see this Pico:   \n [http://www.pixegraffit.hpg.ig.com.br/predio\\_arsenal.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414150909/http:/www.pixegraffit.hpg.ig.com.br/predio_arsenal.jpg)  \n  \n2.

So, here u are, with your first baby .. congrats pal, it looks great.   \n   \nI can't wait to see how will u fit the serif caps 'M', 'Q' in a 9x6 grid .. It will be a though work !   \n   \nSome draws in Pico Sans and Serif looks as the same IMHO (like low m, n, r, q, z). I think u can work better on these ones.   \n   \nSo, this is it.
