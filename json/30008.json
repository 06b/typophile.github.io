  "content": "During Dadaism, what kind of typography was used? I know for a fact that because of the war, everyone was very much against it and started desining outrageous things so does that mean that san serif came to be when designers took off the serifs of Roman influenced lettering? Is that the cause of it and is that how Bauhaus took san serif a step further? where does slab serif come into all this though? And during the 20th century, we see a variety of movements fron Art Deco to Art Noveau to the hippy 70's style type. Is this because society's attitudes changed towards lifestyles etc that everything stated having 'styles-movements' to them? Is it because people wanted to see new innovative things that made designers experiment more with type? what is your theory?\n\n",

      "content": "Marcel Duchamp said \"The only thing worse than a serif typeface is a sans-serif typeface,\" and invented Dingbats as a reaction to what he called \"the tyranny of the alphabet.\" Other Dadaists, perhaps misinterpreting his comment, strived to create faces that were neither serif nor sans-serif, and among the styles to arise from these efforts were slabs and flares. This is recounted on p216 of _I Did Seek The Serif_ by Egbert Gebbinforte, Harper-Mifflin Books, 1998.\n\n"

      "content": "Sans-serif type got respect after Dada, not from it. Dada (along with other things) made rule-breaking much more acceptable (at least in the art world), and probably inspired some of the appearance of sans type in areas other than the commercial jobs where it was seen before. But what really brought out sans type was the work done at the Meisterschule and the Bauhaus, which became an international phenomenon after the publication of Tschichold's _The New Typography_.\n\nStyle movements are related to the attitudes and needs of a society, and as we understand them they are constructs of historians who create terminology that eases discussion. It's important to keep that in mind because there are a lot of styles that get lumped together (ie. arts and crafts, art nouveau, and jungendstil) and in-between periods that get lost in the cracks. Going much deeper than that is the sort of thing that could fill up an entire graduate education.\n\n"

That there was a Dada exhibit in Paris and NYC goes against the grain of the spirit of Dada.
