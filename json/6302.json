      "content": "In TrueType / OpenType TT fonts, you can use ANY em-square (up to 16384). For example 200, 202, 500, 523, 998, 1000, 1024, 2000, 2048, 2049 etc. Pleae forget the neccesity of using an UPM that is a power of two!   \nIf you use FontLab or TypeTool, just design your font as PostScript and generate it as TrueType. If you wish to fine-tune the screen appearance, you can refer to Leslie Cabarga's book \"Learn FontLab Fast\" ( [http://www.logofontandlettering.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010185358/http:/www.logofontandlettering.com/) ) for tips on the process of converting PostScript fonts to TrueType fonts.   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "Also true for PostScript Type 1 and PostScript flavored OpenType fonts, with the caveat that regardless of the em square, all coordinates used in the font must be no greater than +- 4096 (or is it 4095, given the use of zero as a coordinate? I forget).   \n   \nIIRC, earlier versions of FontLab had a problem generating T1/OT-CFF fonts with em squares other than 1000, but I believe that restriction has been lifted.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

Only Office 2003 and Windows 2000/XP/2003 are free from the mentioned limitations of OT PS fonts.   \n   \nThe downside of OT TT is that it does not work on Mac OS 8.6 or 9, and that the outlines are not stored in PostScript curves which seems important to some designers.   \n   \nOther advantages and disadvantages of the formats are listed in the book, most notably regarding hinting.   \n   \nRe 2.:   \n   \nYes, principally OpenType PS/TT helps you solve the compatibility problem, and yet, it is extremely difficult to decide between the PS and the TT flavor because of problems mentioned above.   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam\n\n"

For Microsoft, this surely simplifies quality assurance.   \n   \nMicrosoft explains that on their web page: [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ProductionGuidelines.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010185358/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/ProductionGuidelines.mspx)  \n   \nOther vendors such as Apple or Linotype have been shipping TrueType / OpenType TT fonts with other UPM sizes for years. The value of 1000 is most common, especially if you ship PostScript and TrueType fonts from the same source. But Apple also shipped fonts with completely different UPM sizes, e.g. 400 for the Zapfino (AAT) font in Mac OS X 10.3.   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam\n\n"
