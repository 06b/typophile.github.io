Fonts are catalogued at these establishments by “keyword” metadata, and it’s likely that the word “disco” would be one such keyword for the types you show.\n3. If it is indeed type you are interested in, and not just fonts, you can get a lot more inventive with your search terms.\n4. To be really different, search offline.\n5. Make your own. If you have vector drawing skills, this sort of thing is much easier to do now than back in the day with pen and ink.\n\n"
