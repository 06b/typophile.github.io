Unlike some of the people here who have lived with fonts for most of their careers, I am a relative latecomer to this passion, so as much as my own recollection of typefaces, I rely a lot on piles of books and catalogs, and ID-friendly websites, like MyFonts.com, Identifont, Font Pool, Dafont.com, Veer.com, Fontshop.com (which is getting better for this purpose), and even the Guides on my own site. In fact, I found Tarzana by using Google to search my site for the phrase ’reversed 3’. I have written descriptions of the oddities in the Sans Serif fonts in the Sans Serif Guide, and Google found this for Tarzana, Reykjavik Two, Lebensjoy and Case 150903 Pluto (and also for Eplica in the Serif Guide notes). It didn’t find Dyadis this way, but I knew that was another.\n\nI also knew Eplica, because I bought this font a couple of years ago.\n\nNevertheless, Stephen is absolutely right that asking the font fanatics here is the best way to get a quick ID. I do it too when I get stuck.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
