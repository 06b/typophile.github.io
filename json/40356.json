Do any of the terms you list have citations with verifiable references? If not, you can't trust them. As a Wikipedian myself I know Wikipedia to be a crank magnet---the most powerful crank magnet in the universe. While working on type-related articles there I discovered a lot of programmer-like geeks working on them as well. They consider themselves qualified to write on typography matters, which is absurd really, all things considered, and they have an annoying habit of introducing terms and jargon from the programming world. They justify it by saying that programmers use these terms for writing code.\n\nIf you guys see anything questionable or dubious in Wikipedia's typography articles and it has no citation or reference, jump right in there and put this tag next to the suspect text:\n\n{fact}\n\nThat generates a [citation needed] tag in the rendered article. You don't need to be a registered Wikipedian to do it. Anyone can challenge what's there. If the author(s) who put the unreferenced material in fail to come up with a valid reference within two months it is considered acceptable to remove the unsourced material.\n\nSome people I work with call a slash a \"forward slash\", but it's hard to see the point when \"slash\" makes perfect sense contrasted with \"backslash\".\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Calling it a forward slash helps to make it clearer for them (although I sometimes hear people on the radio mistakenly saying \"backslash\" when reciting a URL). \"Forward slash\" sounds odd mainly to non-Windows users who don't use the backslash so much.\n\n"

A thin sloping or upright line (/, |) occurring in mediæval MSS. as a mark for the cæsura or as a punctuation-mark (frequently with the same value as the modern comma). Now also in more general use with various functions (see quots.). Cf. SLASH _n._¹ 5”\n\n“Solidus” is used by Unicode, and was metaphorically transferred from the symbol separating shillings from pence, since “shilling” is an equivalent to “solidus” which was the Roman gold coin worth about 25 _denarii_ (which itself is the source of “d.” for pence). OED gives this as sense 2:\n\n“2. A sloping line used to separate shillings from pence, as 12/6, in writing fractions, and for other separations of figures and letters; a shilling-mark. Also _attrib._ Cf. OBLIQUE _n._ 5.”\n\n“Oblique” has its first citation in the OED (sense 4) at 1785, although the first citation referring specifically to the typographic sense is from 1965: “1965 W. S. ALLEN _Vox Latina_ 9 Phonemic symbols..are conventionally set between obliques, e.g. /t/.”\n\n“Scratch comma” is attested in the OED under sense V.12.b of SCRATCH: “scratch-comma, a diagonal stroke used by some early printers in place of the comma”\n\nOn the other hand, the OED doesn’t have a lemma for “seperatrix”, which strikes me as suspect anyway.\n\nFeel free to deposit this info in the Wikipedia article.
