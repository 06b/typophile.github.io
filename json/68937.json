I know I used two different fonts and have already identified the first one. Here is what I know:\n\nI first used it 3-5 years ago.  \nI distinctly remember using a font categorized as \"handwriting\"\n\nI would love an exact match, but if that is not possible, I am looking for a font that:  \n-has a larger upper bowl  \n-crosses over the stem at all three junctures  \n-has rough edges instead of smooth  \n-has a comparable slope\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621104404im_/http:/typophile.com/files/binquestion_5116.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [binquestion.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621104404/http:/typophile.com/files/binquestion_0.gif) | 2.4 KB |\n\n",
