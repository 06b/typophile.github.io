      "content": "I don't think we're going anyone a favour discussing whether a 'g' without an ear works while studiously ignoring the fundamental problems of weight, proportion, stress and consistency. It seems obligatory on the Typophile critique to find something nice to say about every typeface, and to limit criticism to details, but the fact is that this is a typeface with a hell of a lot of very basic problems.   \n   \nGraham, you need to go back and look at a lot more type much more closely. Begin with the uppercase letters\\* and concentrate on proportion and stress (pattern of thick and thin strokes). Letters in your design with extreme problems are A, J, M, N, P, R, U, and V. When you've figured out better proportions and have the stress falling in logical places (see especilly M and N), than start looking at details. Check the consistency of your serifs (B, P and R all have problems). The uppercase R probably has more problems than any other letter.   \n   \nFrom looking at some features of your design, especially the E and L, I see that Goudy has been a inspiration. Fred Goudy was occasionally a genius, but he has very little to teach anyone else: his work is idiosyncratic, and when it succeeds its a happy surprise. As a beginner, you would learn more from a more systematic designer like W.A. Dwiggins, Matthew Carter or Walter Tracy, in whose work one can see the logic behind the design decisions. Goudy was a kind of freak of nature.   \n   \nI recommend that you pick up a copy of Gerrit Noordzij's _Letterletter_. Don't treat it as a text book, and don't accept everything that it has to say as gospel, but it will provide you with the mental tools to understand what is happening structurally in a typeface.   \n   \n\\*I wouldn't nomally recommend to a designer working on a 'text' face to start with the uppercase, but I think it is a good way for a beginner to cut his teeth because the number of issues to deal with is smaller than in the lowercase. I think everyone's first typeface design should be caps only.\n\n"

Illiterate typically means unable to read, not unable to write readably.   \n   \nYou ignore GN's statement that 'I encourage left-handed students to write with their left hand [as opposed to some teachers who still force lefties to try to write with the right hand], because they too should work under optimal conditions.' This seems to me a very long way from saying that left handers are 'uncivilised'.   \n   \nHe goes on to to say that the broad nib is 'essential for _discussing_ left-handed writing' [my italics]; he is not saying that everyone must use broad nibs, as you seem to be suggesting, but that the broad nib reveals the difference between left and right hand writing _in the same direction_. His point about writing downwards is that this is the only way for left handed people to obtain the same stress pattern that _readers_ expect and are used to recognising in, ahem, boumas. He does not say anywhere that the result of writing downward is unreadable to themselves or to anyone else: he says completely the opposite, that it is only by writing downwards that they can produce something generally readable. Rather than being contra-reader (user) as you seem to be suggesting, he is saying the opposite: that in order to satisfy the reader a lefty with a broad nib needs to write downward rather than left-to-right.   \n   \nBasically, I think you have completely and utterly misread every sentence of this short piece, perhaps because you have convinced yourself that it is 'cryptic'. It is not: it is straightforward.   \n   \n   \nI have not read Bilak's interview with Majoor, but I'm not sure that you are correct to identify the latter as a 'GN-er'.\n\n"
