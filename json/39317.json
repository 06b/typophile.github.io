  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a new MacBook Pro (intel) laptop. The OS is Mac OS X 10.5. The installed version of Python is 2.5.\n\nI wanted to install RoboFab, but RoboFab’s site states that it only works with versions 2.3 and below. I went to a MacPython site to download an older version, but the builds say that these’ll only work with PowerPC processors.\n\nIs there a way that I can replace my version of Python with an older version that will allow me to use RoboFab?\n\nThanks!  \nDan\n\n [‹ Managing Additional Diacritics in an FL Typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20071231134025/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39377 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Need help with Fontlab batch conversions, bug in action set preferences ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071231134025/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39347 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
