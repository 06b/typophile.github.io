In 1991, FF Scala was released on [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022253/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop) International's [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022253/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) label as its first serious text face. Later on Martin included the much-requested Bold Italic as well as the missing small cap weights. There are also two condensed weights, well-suited both as display faces and for narrow columns of text.\n\nMartin Majoor then enhanced his elegant serif with a companion sans-serif family. Again it is the simplicity that makes FF Scala Sans so captivating, while at the same time its distinct character is immediately recognizable. The family comprises six variants including an italic small caps style, a fairly rare beast in the typographic zoo. All weights come with both old style and lining numerals.\n\n**External Links**  \n [FF Scala microsite](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022253/http:/scalafont.com/)  \n [FF Scala](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022253/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=FF%20Scala) at FontShop  \n [FF Scala fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022253/http:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/scala) at FontFont  \n [Martin Majoor's Type Design Philosophy](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022253/http:/www.martinmajoor.com/6_my_philosophy.html)\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [What category would you classify Meta, Scala, and Thesis?](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022253/http:/typophile.com/node/52083)\n\n",
