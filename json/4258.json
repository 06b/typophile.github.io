My Adobe CS apps handle OpenType and MM faces just fine, but the standard productivity applications (notably Office) seem to recognize each variant as an individual font name\n\n"

For instance, when I was using Font Reserve I actually had a list of fonts that the system needed and so I could \"get rid of\" the rest of them. I'm happy with allowing Suitcase to manage my system fonts but I wonder if less system fonts would somehow equal more.\n\n"
