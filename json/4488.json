  "content": "I recently completed the first draft of a Guaran�-English/English-Guaran� dictionary and language guide for Hippocrene Books; the time has now come to find a proficient speaker of that language to proof my work. Finding a suitable individual in the US has been difficult thus far, as the most qualified candidate will probably be a native Paraguayan with an excellent grasp of English and, of course, Guaran� (and not necessarily Spanish). If anyone here speaks Guaran�, or if you know someone who does, and would like to take on some freelance editing for this project, please contact me at the address listed below. I will forward responses to my editor, which he will then peruse and contact if qualified.   \n   \nThanks all,   \n   \nA. Scott Britton   \n [annot8@hotmail.com](mailto:annot8@hotmail.com)\n\n",

He is very involved in the preservation of Amerindian languages, particularly in Central and South America, and may well be able to put you in touch with someone with sufficient knowledge of both Guaran� and English.
