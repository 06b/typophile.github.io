Word has attached local string (ابجد ھوز) and some not. Examples are Arabic Transparent and Arial respectively? How can I attach this local string to my font?\n\n3. Is it possible to customize this local string (ابجد ھوز)?\n\nBest regards,  \nAtif\n\n [‹ The Em](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213753/http:/typophile.com/node/27742 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [USP10.dll office 2007 vs. Vista ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213753/http:/typophile.com/node/31476 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

When displaying sample string, Office is first looking at font signature in OS/2 table. If it appears to be single-charset font, string for this charset is displayed. For other fonts, string is chosen based on current language.\n\n3. Unfortunately, you can’t customize this string.\n\nThanks,  \nSergey\n\n"
