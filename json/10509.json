  "content": "I ordered this book directly from the British Library Press shortly after reading the press release describing it here, and received it (along with several other books�I have poor self-restraint) about a week later. I just finished reading it, and I figured Typophiles would be interested in it, so here are some brief notes on it. I'll probably write a full review for my (neglected) blog later.   \n   \nThe book covers what Southall calls the \"typographic century\" from 1889 (with the introduction of the Monotype and line casters) through the mid-1990s. It's no tour de force of reasoning about type design, like Walter Tracy's Letters of Credit, but is instead an excellent summary of printing technologies and the effects those technologies have had on the practice of crafting type. With each new technology, he discusses the mechanical aspects affecting reproduction of character images, and then discusses the compromises necessary to produce effective designs for that technology.   \n   \nHe draws several useful relationships, defining type design as the interaction between a client, a designer, and a producer, and shows how the dynamics between these three roles changed as the century progressed. This is informative in several cases, particularly when he discusses the various arguments Stanley Morison got into with the Monotype drafting offices over the design of Eric Gill's Perpetua�a conflict Southall uses to illuminate how the normally more-or-less reasonable Morison didn't trust or respect the Monotype drafters, a conflict Southall puts down to Morison refusing to believe that the draughtsmen at Monotype understood the machinery better than he did.   \n   \nOne of the most striking things about the book is the manner in which it shows how the history of type design follows the contour of 20th century technology in the larger world, starting in mechanized industrial processes, proceeding into a quasi-scientific High Church of Technology (there's a hilarious picture of Adrian Frutiger proofing drawings of Univers while Ladislas Mandel and another Photon employee look on in their lab coats) before dematerializing into pure information at the end of the century. \"Dematerializing\" is a word he uses frequently, as punches, physical models, matrices, and finally even drawings of characters disappear.   \n   \nInstead of ending, like most of us would expect, with the development of Postscript and laser imagesetters, or perhaps OpenType, the last chapter of the book is a fascinating study of a project Southall did with Ladislas Mandel for US West Dex, designing a family of type for phone books. Mandel worked with Adrian Frutiger on the development of phototype, as well as the design of Univers, so he's no stranger to technical innovation, but when confronted by the demanding combination of tiny type and low-quality printing, he judges Postscript fonts unacceptable, insisting on pixel accuracy along with scalability. A fascinating discussion follows, with Southall describing the process by which he used Donald Knuth's Metafont to create a family of typefaces in which scalable outlines are combined with features (i.e. ink traps and the quasi-serifs used to compensate for ink spread) that stay the same absolute size regardless of the point size of the type.   \n   \nThe clear implication of Southall's conclusion is that the technology of typeface development is still under development, and that none of the current solutions are sufficient to solve many of the real-world type design problems that were easily solved by hand-cut type 100 years ago. After reading about the elegant (although laborious, and somewhat crufty) solution Southall devised for encoding fonts for US West, Adobe's \"optical sizing\" seems like kind of a halfassed joke, even though designing fonts for Metafont is a nightmare (as Southall's chapter on TeX, with which he has long experience, makes perfectly clear).   \n   \nThe book is a fun read and pulls together details from a variety of sources so wide that few of us are likely to have encountered many of them before. It deserves a wider audience than it will receive, I'm afraid�I think any digital type designer could gain a huge amount from paying attention to the problems encountered by type designers in older technologies, as well as the constraints they erected to deal with them. It also makes me appreciate achievements like Times Roman and Sabon all the more, even while recognizing that what made them triumphs over constraint in the past renders them somewhat superfluous today. Anyone who's read this far owes it to themselves to read the book.\n\n",

      "content": "This is a great description and makes the book seem essential. I disagree with but one point, the last. I have always had the feeling that many works of art and craft owed their perpetual greatness to the overcoming of the merely temporary constraint that was put in the craftsman/artist's way at the time the work was being made. In other words, it was the constraint which inspired the artist to greatness, and that is not invalidated in later generations when the constraint is removed. Just to give some silly examples, is Shakespeare any less great because he couldn't say all the things he could have said today, and, today, would have said, just because he could have? Is Mozart's music now invalid because he didn't know chromaticism or the 12-tone system? Is Bach invalid because he had none of our modern instruments? It is interesting to note as a 'case' that Forster's unpublished novel, in which he discusses everything he couldn't, is his weakest. Is any type less good because of the technical constraints which exist at the time it was made? Are the types we make today less good because of the constraints (mostly indolence, I fear!) that exist for us today? What, for that matter, is more appealing about type than its constraints? Isn't it just because of its constraints, and the incalculable lure there is in the feeling of overcoming, that we wish to make type? Isn't constraint the very reason we are interested in type? What is Goethe's famous remark? Something like, 'Man lebt solang er strebt'? Man lives so long as he strives?   \n   \nActually, checking on the source, I see I err somewhat. It is, 'Es irrt der Mensch, solang er strebt' Man errs as long as he strives.   \n   \nYet in context, the words are spoken by God to the Devil, the question is the tempting of Faust. What God roughly says is, So long as man lives on the earth, you will not be forbidden to tempt him, for man errs as long as he strives.   \n   \nThe Devil thanks God for this sentiment politely, pointing out, in Kaufmann's translation that he wants them living, and 'When corpses come, I have just left the house--I feel as does the cat about the mouse.'   \n   \nAnyway, what art/craft is about constraint if type is not?\n\n"

      "content": "In any given typeface (poem, painting, sonata, dinner) one needs to distinguish three formal achievements that may be present: the brilliant fittedness of form to constraint (when the the constraint becomes part of the architecture), the bravura or virtuoso overcoming of constraint (the demonstration that the constraint was not so constraining as everyone else had thought), and the optimal compromise (when the constraint can be neither worked to advantage nor overcome, but must be accepted and the best limited solution found). Of course, it is unusual to find all three achievements in a single work.   \n   \nForrest mentions Sabon, which is a very good example of a work with deliberately imposed and considerable constraints. Most people agree, I think, that the lowercase italic _o_ in Sabon is a disaster, excusable only on account of the constraints of duplexing and unitising. Alternatively, the italic _o_ could be considered an achievement of the third kind: an optimal compromise within the terms of the constraints. This kind of achievement is seldom valued very highly, and most people do not recognise it as an achievement at all. But there are few things more useful to consider when trying to get into the head of the maker of a thing: to examine the part that doesn't quite seem to work, to understand why it has been made that way, and to grasp that, under the constraints, it is indeed the best solution that could be found.   \n   \nBut the optimal compromise should be seen as the achievement that the maker would most like to replace or revise, if the constraints were lifted. There is no way that Tschichold wanted to make that italic _o_ so wide (or the roman _a_ -- and we have his drawings to confirm this). If the constraints were lifted, i.e. if he had the chance to revise the typeface for new typesetting systems that did not impose the particular duplexing and unitising constraints of Linotype and Monotype, but which allowed much greater refinement in the widths of letters, I have little doubt that he would have removed as many compromises as possible.\n\n"

      "content": "The problem with technologically imposed constraints is that they're essentially arbitrary: the machine tells you what you can and cannot do, rather than you rationally deciding what does and doesn't work aesthetically or functionally. While compositors and typesetters would have been fools to not welcome the Linotype and the Monotype with open arms, it seems undeniable to me that the work of those who attempted to design patterns for letters got a lot harder, for no reason other than that things they were easily able to do with hand set type weren't possible with the new technologies.   \n   \nBy duplexing italics onto the matrices with the romans, Linotype essentially broke the ancient function of italic, which was to be a more economical alternative to roman type. Granted, that function had been lost already, largely, but suddenly it became a law that could only be broken at great cost. Next to that, losing the ability to kern seems somewhat trivial.   \n   \nYes, Sabon was a beautiful technical achievement, and Tschichold deserves much credit for creating a typeface that was both serviceable and elegant given those constraints. But take away the context in which it was designed, and you just have another garamond type. I [talk about this on my blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123024727/http:/www.pushby.com/forrest/typ/arc/007973.html) (somewhat hamfistedly, because I'm still wrestling with this issue in my head). I believe that Sabon has the cachet among typographers that it does because of Tschichold's near-unique achievement in making an identical typeface for three different typesetting systems, rather than any inherent beauty in the typeface itself. We're praising the constraints rather than praising the product. Or so I believe.   \n   \nAnd when you read Southall's book, you will see that attempting to grapple with technological constraints has turned promising projects into epic trainwrecks far more often than producing Sabons. Walter Tracy in _Letters of Credit_ and Stanley Morison in _A Tally of Types_ allude to some of these disasters as well, although not as explicitly.   \n   \nThe Renaissance masters sharply limited the primary colors in their palettes, and worked with very austere geometry and forced perspectives, and produced some of the greatest art the world has ever seen. But they chose those constraints, in large part (although there's an argument to be made that they were making the best of what they had, given the relative paucity of vivid pigments during the Renaissance), instead of having them arbitrarily imposed on them. I think type still has a ways to go until the technological constraints in digital typeface design are low enough that we can impose new ones of our own choosing without tangling with our technology.\n\n"

Granted, he understood a lot more about type and typesetting than any of us.   \n   \nIt is very easy to say what is wrong with traditional Sabon. Those are relatively easy insights to arrive at, even though we all feel we come to them only after exhausting study. (I have no comment on the redesign.) It takes considerably more acute analysis to discover what is right about it. Why did Tracy choose just that seemingly hopelessly compromised typeface for his masterpiece? What is it about Sabon that appealed to him so greatly? What lessons are we missing here?\n\n"

      "content": "What Zapf may want from type at this point is almost as little known as what Heidegger wanted of God late in life. There are two fallacies here. The first is that Optima Nova represents Zapf's final wishes. The second is that his final wishes are typographically definitive.   \n   \nIn type, you are only as good as your collaborators. Your final wishes are interesting but do not necessarily result in better design.   \n   \nType is not art, and cannot be treated as art. There is little room for the artist's viewpoint either in design or in criticism. This is what Tracy was attempting to teach. It is really striking to me, again and again, how the best type is so often produced by people who are not great intellectuals, not great aesthetes, not great thinkers - people who can often barely spell, and probably can't write and can't really think well as we should probably define it. The best type people are often rather, well, I don't want to say strikingly grotty, or something really classist, but how else to get the point across?   \n   \nFinally, just a little technical point. Anybody who thinks Zapf would consider definitive a version of Optima designed under the limitations of the Postscript grid is naive. I mean, he does have an eye.   \n   \nSo in type, you're only as good as your collaborators. But consider this: in digital we have so much freedom that Zapf did not have in Optima. But in Lino metal, he had one crucial freedom we do not have: infinite, seemless variation of curve and stroke, well beyond the capabilities of the ignoble Postscript grid. So one might say, although I don't like to, that in digital type, you're only as good as your maximum grid. 1,000 x 1,000 is not enough for a designer of the quality of Zapf, or anyone else really interested in achieving definitive statements. That is why some nuts today are still designing with Ikarus. A 15,000 x 15,000 grid really does let you say what you want to say - even when it is just the simple technical matter of duplicating the quality of an historical or pre-Postscript design.\n\n"

      "content": "I didn't intend to suggest that the original Optima is no longer avaialble. My point is that the \"Optima\" quality has been lost in the new version, by over-serifization.   \n   \nAs for italics, IMO the \"proper\" italic for Frutuger Next is far more successful than that of Optima Nova, especially in the heavy weights, which are quite gorgeous. The synergies which make one update a success but not another are enigmatically circumstantial.   \n   \nJohn, I think most of us agree that the new \"Sabon\" is really more of a Garamond, so closely was the personality of Tschicold's design of the original invested in the openly-fitted, duplexed roman+italic kind of layout in which it excelled. Bill, there is something about that kind of layout which must have appealed to Tracy.   \n   \nThere is nothing inherently wrong with having Italic and Roman with the same character count. It's a very modernist idea, and you will find that the mid 19th century moderns (Scotches) have this feature of an equivalence in tonality and count. The idea, mid 20th C, that a sloped roman was a desirable form of italic, had a lot going for it. After all, this was the dominant form of the 20th century sans italic (sans Gill Sans), and a matching form of serifed italicization is logical.   \n   \nI'm not sure how much bearing my criticism has on the usefulness of Optima Nova today, but I think that when typographers familiarize themselves with typefaces, they do form an impression based, not just on the functionality of the way the face behaves, but also on an awareness of the personality and virtue of the letterforms under close scrutiny.   \n   \nUltimately, my take on revivals is that tinkering is a mistake. A revival should be either scrupulously faithful to the original, or respect it enough to put some design distance between the two, with a consistently new interpretation based on a fresh insight into the way things have changed between then and now.\n\n"

If so, then there is an obvious reason: Linotype machinery, I have read, requires that the italic character is the same width as the corresponding roman character.   \n   \nYour point about revivals is plausible, but I don't know it it's true. I personally am happy that Zapf had a chance to re-make the face in the way he thought most appropriate for digital. Time will tell, I guess, how useful it is compared to the original digitization. I guess I would be interested in whether the serifs on the a and c were Zapf's idea or Kobayashi's. I suspect they were Zapf's.\n\n"

It's an integral part of the typeface's personality; changing it changes the personality of the typeface; with their longer arms and angled trim, the r and f of the Nova alter the open, even color of the type, taking the initial simple rigor in a smoother and more complex direction. This is a quality of digital type (measurable, no doubt, by Fourier patterns) which has its merits, but in a pre-digital era typeface design, it doesn't appeal to a purist like me.   \n   \n ![fi_opt](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123024727im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/70845.jpg)   \n   \nEnough of criticizing Hermann Zapf, how about some praise?
