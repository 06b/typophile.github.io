Solo. The font you want might be on one of them -- unfortunately, I haven't found an easy way to know exactly what's on there. You might just have to go to a bookstore or art supplies store and look at them in person. Hope that isn't a wild-goose chase.\n\n"

Anyway, I think this typeface is Linotype Memphis, which had identical alternate characters to the A & M shown here. See attached scan from 1930's Linotype Catalog. However, I can't see any evidence that the digital version of Memphis has these characters. ![Memphis scan](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051009im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20228.gif)\n\n"
