I mean, it's the bleeding 21st century, where are the \"fully animated\" script fonts that scrawl beautiful handwriting from the late eighteenth century, complete with ink effects, before your very eyes? How long will it take to develop the technology? How long will it take type designers to make one \"fully animated\" font, most-like?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013112206im_/http:/typophile.com/files/melon_wrangling_4785.jpg)\n\n_I don't mind as long as somebody else is paying the development cost. Yes that would be the coolest thing evarr, and I've been wondering if it can even be done. But also try---handing out fifty dollar notes to grateful strangers._\n\n3) If OpenType supports the animated font format of the future, at the product launch which witty and entertaining \"household-name\" type designers would you \"most-like to have\" trading goofballs at the opening ceremony?\n\n_I don't mind as long as somebody else is paying, and David Berlow and Chris Lozos are there because I really want to meet them!_\n\n4) What's with the \"I don't mind as long as somebody else is paying\" thing? What's up with that Jim?\n\n_It was the basis for a radio spot I helped write._\n\n5) If you were going on a \"fun and interesting\" holiday tomorrow, what destination would you \"most-like\" to go to?\n\n_I don't mind as long as somebody else is paying._\n\n6) If you won a free trip to the moon in a gleaming metal spaceship, which interesting and talkative typophile member would you \"most-like\" to go along with you?\n\nI don't mind as long as somebody else is paying.

In the future there will be more than movies made about fonts --- \"feature fonts\" will rival movies for audience share.\n\nThe task of developing an animated font format is comparable to the difficulty experienced by a small cat rolling a large watermelon ashore on the Ivory Coast.\n\nTypography will become a performance art and typographers will become more like actors. The really experienced type designers will have to be like film directors.\n\n\"mew\"\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Skilled calligraphers will rule the day!\n\nI already bought up all the commercial rights to the best \"motion picture font\" titles. I used a Variety annual and worked out every possible name in advance, adapting existing Hollywood movie properties to typo lingua franca. My producer friend Amanda is looking to sign Nick Shinn to direct _The Shinning_, with Jill Bell and Ronna Penner attached for lead roles. I want to get Stuart Sandler for special visual effects.\n\nTypophiles are invited to give their own \"witty and thought-provoking\" answers to the wacky questions presented in this thread. Replace the repeated dummy text \"I don't mind as long...\" with something you \"most like\".\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": " **Sample Motion Picture Font Quiz**\n\n1) What features would you most like to see in the animated font format of the future?\n\n2) Should motion picture fonts have sound? Maybe that will come later.\n\n3) In the early days of silent motion picture fonts, Ray Larabie had big hits with which font comedies?  \n(a) The Bold Rush  \n(b) A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Font Forum  \n(c) Take The Money Fonts and Run  \n(d) Eth Girls are Easy\n\n4) Which prodigiously talented female lettering artist of our time would you have make The Caron Carpenter Story into a feature length font?\n\n5) Which legendary type designers would you sign for The Caslons of War? My money is on Gerald Giampa to direct, with Sumner Stone on second unit and Brian J. Bonislawskyi directing special visual effects.\n\n6) The Caslons of War won oscars for which categories?  \n(a) Least Contrived Art Direction  \n(b) Best Supporting Serif  \n(c) Sturdiest Crossbar in a lead role  \n(d) Worst Ink Detail in a Historical Font\n\n7) Most of the money in motion picture font production wiil be in commercial lettering capable of block-buster style special effects and tranformations. Unlike feature length fonts, advertising lettering will only run a few minutes and be cheaply produced from stock libraries. The lucrative Adobe stock libraries are culled from which feature length fonts?  \n(a) Futura Cop  \n(b) The Ball Terminator  \n(c) Children of the Kern  \n(d) Hrant & the Masters of the Univers\n\n8) When riots brought shooting of the first 3D feature font Dial M for Murga to a halt, the font's director Harold Lohner was heard to mutter which exasperated turn of phrase?  \n(a) Oh brother where art Downer?  \n(b) Die deresis die!  \n(c) Please don't eat the accents.  \n(d) Whatever happened to Baby J?\n\n9) Which gritty motion picture font about the big apple won the 2034 academy award for Best Inktraps?  \n(a) Manhatten(schweiler)  \n(b) The Side Bearings of New York  \n(c) Font Apache the Bronx  \n(d) The Purple Rows of Biro\n\n10) I've used up two fonty-flavoured film titles on one font already. The ill-fated Citizen Kern had to be rechristened Midnight Kernboy to avoid trademark conflict with Zuzana Licko's Citizen. Name one other font christened after a motion picture film that had to be remonikered because of trademark conflict with Berthold's City font.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
