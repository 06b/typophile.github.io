Does any one know of any fonts that are similar to any of the fonts used in this image?\n\nAny help or suggestions would be great, cheers!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Sarasate Melodien.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624203132/http:/typophile.com/files/Sarasate%20Melodien.jpg) | 251.02 KB |\n\n",

I doubt if you will exactly match these, but you could be true to the feeling of the time period.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
