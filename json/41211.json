I've been trying to find an appropriate free license, along the lines of the GPL/copyleft which might cover any nasties/abuses happening later.\n\nI'm aware that there are issues with GPL licenses in fonts. (See here: [http://www.typophile.com/node/31738](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015164046/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31738 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/31738\")) So it needn't be a GPL license. I just can't find an appropriate, simple license text specific to font distribution.\n\nEssentially it needs to cover my free distribution, future free distribution (license intact) and my copyright.\n\nAnyone with a similar license they use?\n\n",
