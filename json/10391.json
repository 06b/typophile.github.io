He also has his other books for sale and will gladly inscribe them. His year-long Smart Papers speaking tour is almost over, so be sure to catch him if you are in the Pacific Northwest. He will be speaking to the AIGA (non-members also welcomed) on May 3th in Portland, and May 5th in Seattle. Here are the blurbs from the AIGA sites with links to them,   \nPortland, May 3rd   \n [http://www.portland.aiga.org/events/doyald\\_young.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415090015/http:/www.portland.aiga.org/events/doyald_young.html)   \nSeattle, May 5th   \n [http://www.aigaseattle.org/events/index.asp?include=May\\_2005#05](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415090015/http:/www.aigaseattle.org/events/index.asp?include=May_2005#05)   \n   \nTell him I sent you! ;-)   \nJill\n\n",
