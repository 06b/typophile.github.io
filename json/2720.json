  "content": "I'm trying to locate a commercially available typeface approximating the look of a Bodoni or Didot Sans. I'm aware of Peter Bilak's unpublished Didot Sans, but have yet to find anything that captures the same spirit. I've located numerous, Deco-styled faces that have the thick/thin qualities of a Didot, but the contrast is typically too exaggerated and the proportions too condensed.   \n   \nCreating a new face isn't an option as the budget on the job does not allow for the time needed to do so...   \n   \nDoes anyone know of any typefaces out there that preserve the classic proportions of a Didot, minus it's serifs? Any assisitance would be greatly appreciated.   \n   \nThanks.\n\n",

      "content": "Britannic has always struck me as being one of the most successful high-contrast sans serif faces.   \nHowever, it has the full curves of a grotesque, not the more geometric, neoclassical shapes of Bodoni-era \"moderns\".   \n   \nThe over-extension and turning back of the curved terminals in \"c\", for instance, provide the opportunity for a purposeful end to the stroke, not just snipping it off, which would be the minimal, pure-didone logic.   \n   \nSo, it would make a good pairing not with the original moderns, but with more contemporary (ie c.1900) moderns such as, ahem, Monotype Modern 2, or De Vinne.   \n   \nFor a 3some, add Grot. #9.   \n   \nIf in doubt for matching faces, make them from the same era.\n\n"

You   \ncould chop off the serifs, but I'm not sure how good   \nthe results would be.\n\n"
