  "content": "Hi all,\n\nApologies if this is the wrong forum, happy for it to moved if it is.\n\nAnyway, I absolutely love the Y in Lithos, it is perfect for incorporating into a logo. However, the rest of the characters don't fit in. Can anyone recommend any similar fonts that have a y, that basically looks like to arms reaching out (apologies, best way I could explain).\n\nAt this stage I am open to either serif or sans-serif, I am trying to give the font a friendly, yet traditional feel, sort of like a hybrid between the two if possible.\n\nI may have to find a suitable font, then adapt the y to get it to have a friendly, arms opening feel, I just thought if anyone knew of any fonts to start with, it would be here.\n\nAppreciate any help.\n\nThanks\n\n",
