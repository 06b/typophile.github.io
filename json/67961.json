It was conceived as a typeface, used as an image and discovered as an ornament.\n\nIt comes in 10 weights of light, regular, medium, semibold and bold, each with italics.\n\nGET RUE DISPLAY NOW SPECIAL  \nINTRODUCTORY OFFER: 20% OFF - Use discount code 392fcfab\n\n[http://www.type-together.com/Rue%20Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819162317/http:/www.type-together.com/Rue%20Display \"http://www.type-together.com/Rue%20Display\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819162317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/01b_6004.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819162317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/02b_6533.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819162317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/03b_3875.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819162317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/04b_5352.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819162317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/05b_6215.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819162317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/06b_4958.jpg)\n\n",
