  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need help with the AFDK tools.\n\nI have been “designing” fonts for about a half year in FontLab, and I have some work finished (sort of) now, and ready for testing.\n\nI downloaded the AFDKO and installed the software with the “FinishInstallOSX” dropped into the Terminal.\n\nMy problem is basic... I don’t know how to use Terminal well enough to use the tools now that I have them. I need the five-minute tutorial from someone who might have been through this already. Specifically, I need help with the checkOutlines routine.\n\nWhere to I put the path to the font I want to check?\n\n(and that sort of thing)\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBrian\n\n [‹ Nodes at Extremes Problems](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203184548/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39055 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Caps to small caps ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203184548/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38910 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Brian,\n\nIf you already gone through the step of installing the tools and all went, it’s actually quite simple to use them. In the case of checkOutlines, just open a Terminal window and type `checkOutlines -h ` for getting the Help, or `checkOutlines -u ` for information about Usage.\n\ncheckOutlines can operate on Type 1 fonts (.pfa or .ps) and on OpenType CFF fonts (.otf). To check a font file located on your Desktop you can type something like this: `checkOutlines /Users/your_username_here/Desktop/YourFont.otf`  \nSome messages will appear on the Terminal window, and a file named checkOutlines.log will be created on the Desktop containing them.\n\nCheck these PDFs to get some more info about other AFDKO tools:  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007\\_St...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203184548/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007_StateOfTheArt_Font_QE.pdf \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007\\_StateOfTheArt\\_Font\\_QE.pdf\")  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/QE\\_Outputs.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203184548/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/QE_Outputs.pdf \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/QE\\_Outputs.pdf\")\n\n"
