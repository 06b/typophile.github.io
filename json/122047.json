  "content": "Hello All,\n\nI am looking for a free small x-height serif font that has the minimum printing space usage characteristics of Linden Hill but is a regular serif and not a slab serif.\n\nI would also like to know if it is possible to design fonts using a computer instead of manually drawing them on a drawing board. If it is, what are some good application programs to use to design fonts.\n\nThanks for any feedback you can provide.\n\nJim Williams\n\n",
