Mark Porter, Art Director of The Guardian, was in charge of the redesign, following the model of the British paper. My guess is that it’s a custom designed font, either by [Christian Schwartz](http://web.archive.org/web/20071010134319/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Christian%252BSchwartz) who did the [The Guardian faces](http://web.archive.org/web/20071010134319/http:/christianschwartz.com/guardian.shtml) which were also inspired by [Gerard Unger](http://web.archive.org/web/20071010134319/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gerard%252BUnger)’s work, or by Gerard himself.\n\n"

These days, that term is usually interpreted as referring to a revival, i.e. the way Fenway was ’inspired’ by Fleischman’s work. We were certainly influenced by contemporary Dutch type design, and Gerard’s work is an important part of that, but we were also influenced by 19th century English Egyptians, Mark’s love of Renaissance italics, and the headline face the great Willi Fleckhaus used in <cite>Twen</cite>. Did you doze off during our lecture, Yves?\n\n"

What I meant to say is that one could see the similarities between Gerard Unger’s style and Publico, which are both rooted in the contemporary Dutch type design indeed. And I apologise for forgetting to mention Paul’s name (second time I irked Paul — this will look _not_ good on my resume). :^/\n\n\\> _Did you doze off during our lecture, Yves?_\n\nHardly, as you must’ve figured out from my review, but it _is_ nine months ago, innit? ;^)\n\n"
