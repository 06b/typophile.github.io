They can be hard to use, the important thing is to never stop messing about with them.  \nKenn’s designs are usually based on an underlying system that allows the user to ‘build’ words, or in the case of dingbats — images. This obsession is due to the hours and hours spent playing with LEGO bricks and model kits in his childhood.  \nKenn Munk is also the designer of \"Antlor - The Deer Departed\": [http://www.antlor.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205003821/http:/www.antlor.net/ \"http://www.antlor.net\")\n\nwebsite: [http://www.kennmunk.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205003821/http:/www.kennmunk.com/ \"http://www.kennmunk.com\")  \nportfolio: [http://folio.kennmunk.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205003821/http:/folio.kennmunk.com/ \"http://folio.kennmunk.com\")\n\n",
