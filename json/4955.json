I think this will help in evaluating the relationships between letterforms vs. the relationship between letterforms and the box. I think you're on the right track with the \"r\", but I'm not sold on the \"F\" yet. Outside of the black box, I think you can increase the letter spacing between some of the letters more easily (i-r, m-e for starters).   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

(Actually, not you   \nbut your friend.)   \n\\* the m seems too wide.   \n   \nbj\n\n"

You responded well to this critique.   \n   \nI'm not sure if the wavy lines capture the essence of construction in any ways that I am familiar with, but I could just be naive. Given the choices, I think I'd go with the bottom layout, but I'd increase the gray space in the center and decrease the weight of the lower black bar substantially, either by making it thinner or changing it to a dark gray.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"
