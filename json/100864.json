  "content": "Hello everyone, this is my first post here. I couldn't figure out this font with whatthefont or identifont or the help of a few co-workers, or going through my whole font library one at a time, so I ask if you recognize this font.\n\nI have a photo of the font, and a version where I blackened a selection of the letters, and a version where I blackened and sheared the letters back to an angle that seemed non-italicized. Thanks guys.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713193015im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Service_C_4575.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713193015im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Service_C_blackened_5915.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713193015im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Service_C_blackened_and_sheared_4681.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713193015im_/http:/typophile.com/files/968652_6443.JPG)\n\n",
