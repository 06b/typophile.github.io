Oh, and nobody did justifed type until this century.\n\nWhen I countered that Gutenberg used justifed text, he kinda brushed me off saying, “yeah, but he had lots of kerning.”\n\nAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI think I’m better off never taking a class from him again.

That is rediculous.\n\nHe’s never heard of H & J’s? He’s never seen a gorgeous book from Hartley and Marks? Or Hyphen? Or David R. Godine? Does he use Bringhursts Elements? Has he ever seen a book? Has he ever seen a piece of classical literature?\n\nI feel brilliant compared to this guy. Well, your homework should be easy right. Just wipe with a couple pieces of paper, bind them together and put them on his desk, he’ll probably praise you as a genius.\n\nThis just makes me angry. I’ve had a few teachers that talk like they know about things they actually dont, but this guy takes the cake.\n\nIf you’d be so kind to your classmates and recommend to them, James Felici’s [Complete Manual of Typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908123146/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Complete%252BManual%252Bof%252BTypography) and regard anything he says with a grain of salt.\n\n\\*When you’re done with him for good, file a formal complaint with the school, and include TP threads to back you up. \\* You could learn more from that book in a week.\n\n"

He teaches the web design class at my school, but I had a feeling he was teaching web design circa 1998. I asked him if you could design an entire web page NOT using tables, and he responded, “Why would you want to do that?”\n\nSo I went and found the greatest book on web design I’ve ever seen, the Head First Guide to XHTML, sat down at Barnes and Nobles for about 8 hours reading almost the whole book, then proceded to prove him wrong by creating a thoroughly modern webpage sans tables.\n\n8 hours at Barnes and Nobles Vs. A Quarter of Web Design? Should have saved my money.\n\nThe sad part is that this guy is the advisor for graduating students in the design program.\n\n"

That’s exactly why I always tell freshman and sophomore students to never take a Photoshop class and to just buy Classroom in a Book instead.\n\nOn a related note, last semester I had a web design class by a first-rate designer/web developer/UI developer. Unfortunately the curriculum he had to teach us had not been updated since HTML 4.0, so most lectures went something like this:\n\n“Ok, open up Dreamweaver and create an X by X table. Now stick the images into it. Now go through the image map tutorial. Once you’ve finished this, remember to never, ever design a web site like this. God I hate this curriculum.

A table in a table in a table etc. This brings totally confusing markup. If a beginner tries to keep the layout neat... there are not much problems with css. Especially if a teacher with profund knowledge in semantic markup and css is on his side.\n\nPS.  \nBeginners should use a “simple” codeeditor instead of Dreamweaver and such.\n\n"

Is that too much to ask for a supposedly WYSIWYG program?\n\nThat’s why I went and got the book, which not only tells you what to do, it tells you WHY you need to do it. Purely semantic mark-up using XHTML Strict and CSS. Oh, and it teaches you to use TextEdit for all of your coding.\n\nIt makes more sense for me as a designer, honestly. I can rough out the entire page by hand in picas like any other design, then the coding is purely spec’ing everything out in ems. It’s like what I suppose designers had to do way back in the day when they didn’t do their own typesetting.\n\nIt allows me to focus on what I want to do, rather than what I can do.

This is why I expect Flash to eventually surpass XHTML/CSS: Macromedia was already doing a lot of great stuff with stylesheets, dynamic content, and database connectivity. Once Adobe’s engineers have overhauled Flash and Flex to be more user-friendly I expect that Flash will be the solution to everyone’s XHTML and browser compatibility woes.\n\n"
