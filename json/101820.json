  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is my first attempt to get competent critique about my font. So please, Don’t beat me up too hard :)  \nI will be very appreciated about any critics and comments.  \nMy first serif typeface I am trying to make a little bit retro, fashy, but contemporary.  \nIt has 5 different serif shapes depending on the position of prominent parts of letters (maybe a little bit too complicated, but I like it).  \nI know there are still many things to work on and improve, but the main parts I am really not sure about are sharp ends of stems. The stems are the only parts without any serifs and I guess it makes the whole face unusual.  \nPlease look at PDF files attached below.  \nI made the stems a little bit out of the baseline to prevent them to look shorter than next letters, but I think it still looks wired at large points. At sample \"i\" looks longer than next \"l\" and so on.. . May be I made them too sharp or too long? Is there any way to do not change the shape? Or may be I need to make the bottom parts of letters more consequent? Or it is Okay?  \nI need your opinions.\n\nThank you for your time and responce!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721203206im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Half_Serif_3_sm_5567.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Unique.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721203206/http:/typophile.com/files/Unique_2.pdf) | 767.08 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Thank You for comments!  \nI see You`re right about the same design of letters. Also I made changes of the \"R\" the same way.  \nBut now there is a dilemma - which shape to use?  \nWith the sharper one font looks even sharper, than it was before. And letter spacing seems more tight to me.  \nI had tried the rounded style instead, but the rounded \"D\" almost looks like \"O\".  \nWhat do you think, is the difference between the \"D\" and \"O\" noticeable enough to choose the rounded version?\n\nP.S. It would be great if anyone could comment the length of stems (problem described at the start of this topic, in PDF file). This is the main and the most important question for me.  \nIf anyone can notice some more problems in this typeface, please, let me know!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721203206im_/http:/typophile.com/files/test_Rounded_5457.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721203206im_/http:/typophile.com/files/test_Sharper_3986.jpg)\n\n"
