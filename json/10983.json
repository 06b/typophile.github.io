Haven't really had to address the formatting of degree notations before, but now it's an issue.   \n   \nAnyone have any advice for treating small caps in this situation? Things like BS Ed, BS Ag, M Ed. Right now, we're treating the first section (BS) as two small caps, and the 2nd section (Ed) as initial cap small cap.   \n   \nSuggestions?\n\n",

My degree (from San Jose State) is rather unusual, so my goal is to provide a bit of explanation in my format choice. The person's name is size \"x\", the degree (in U&lc) is approx. 80% of x, the explanation (in this case GRAPHIC DESIGN) is at approx.size 60% of x.   \n ![sample designation format](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023141028im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/8871.gif)\n\n"
