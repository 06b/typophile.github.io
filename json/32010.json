  "content": "Well, okay, maybe not exactly fascinating, but it's puzzling.\n\nFrom an aesthetic standpoint, the ogonek seems less like a grafted on diacritic and more like the kind of thing that requires integration into a modified glyph. I'm working on a full set of central European diacritics, and the ogonek is giving me headaches.\n\nSince the ogonek is connected to its parent glyph (rather than keeping its distance like most other diacritics), does the design and size of the ogonek remain consistent between characters, or should it and its, um, host character be tweaked a bit to better fit the differences between, say, an \" **E**\" and a \" **u**\"?\n\n",
