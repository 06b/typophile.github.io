  "content": "I’m working on a complete rebranding and was given the task of coming up with type options for the client. The key words associated with the brand are ’Real’ ’Determined’ ’Down To Earth’ ’Strong’ and it’s a sports affiliated brand. Right now they’re using a rather boring squarish sans. What I’m looking to do is give them suggestions on a Display typeface and a Body copy/legal complimentary sans with multiple weights (regular, light, bold & italic). I’m definitely looking for a fresh/new typeface for the display setting, something that isn’t widely used/overused.\n\nI’ve not had a whole lot of free time to spend on here recently and as such don’t feel like I have my finger on the pulse of what’s going on typographically/foundry-wise these days. This is where your help comes in! :o)\n\nAny suggestions of typefaces or where to find info on recent releases that might be relevant would be great!\n\n [‹ Looking for an elegant condensed Monospace typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201163414/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49221 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typeface suggestions - old auto shop signage ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201163414/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49199 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I don’t think as far as a matching pair that I need two variations of the same design, but I do like the heavier weights of Prelo Slab.\n\nFeeltheKern: Union looks great and has tons of weights/faces which could be well utilized.\n\nAny other thoughts?\n\n"
