Im working on a logo for a home alarm and software company that doesn't really know which leg to lean on, the alarm leg or the software leg and I shall try to combine theese two into one logo and still keep the message clear. So, if you have an idea of a font that feels like software and safety at the same time I would be happy to read your suggestions. Thank you.  \nPetter\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [connect\\_logo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214110211/http:/typophile.com/files/connect_logo.gif) | 3.27 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Thank you all for your suggestions and ideas. I have left the idea with rounded E:s since I thought that the word came apart, DETECT is the word. PTL Notes works well with its slightly rounded corners and I like it alot but its quite close to the original logo and the client wants a total makeover (without graphics).  \nUsing capital letters, which I think enhances the security feeling, doesnt really work that well because the Es and Ts are very stiff and simmilar and doesnt really give the word very much of the fonts \"character\". The word really only consists of D and E since the D/C and E/T are simmilar shapes. Ive been trying to do something with the D and C but I dont really like to fiddle with existing fonts to much but I think I will have to since Im not allowed to create any graphics.\n\n"
