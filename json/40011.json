The typeface was created at, and released by the [Klingspor](http://web.archive.org/web/20120820054838/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingspor) foundry. Today, the digital version is available at [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20120820054838/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype). [P22](http://web.archive.org/web/20120820054838/http:/typophile.com/wiki/P22) has also made their own version.\n\nNeuland arose out of Koch's desire to begin cutting his typefaces himself. Previously, his punches were made by Klinsgpor staff, who made them by referencing his drawings.\n\nKoch cut each letter at actual size. There was no pre-planned \"design.\" Because of this, each size of lead type's design was different. This is sadly lost in the digital version, which does not have optical masters.\n\nKoch would go on to cut his own \"serious\" type as well.\n\nUpon seeing the initial concept, [Karl Klingspor](http://web.archive.org/web/20120820054838/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Karl%20Klingspor), the foundry's head, told Koch that he found Neuland ugly, but that Koch should go ahead and make it anyway… Klingspor was sure that the end result would sell well. It did.\n\nNeuland Inline was used as the logo for the movie _Jurrasic Park_. The font seems all tied up with weird tribal art now. It is of course pure Weimar German, and not African at all.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Alternative to Papyrus](http://web.archive.org/web/20120820054838/http:/typophile.com/node/39867)\n\n**Additional Articles:**  \n [New Black Face](http://web.archive.org/web/20120820054838/http:/www.studio-gs.com/neuland.html)\n\n",
