  "content": "Hello typophiles. I'm watching this discussions for a while and now decided to put my very first typeface here.\n\nI've started with type design and this typeface on Summer workshop Tipobrda 2012 in Slovenia. It went through many changes and ideas, many times thrown in trash, many times totaly redesigned. I would like to stop at some point and do the rest of the design process. Still I'm not sure about this stage it and that's why I'm posting it here.\n\nHere is simple latin alphabet. Texts, diacritics and greek are in attachments. Also I put there one older stage of design.\n\nI'll be very gratefull for any comments and especialy critique.\n\nAnje Hairline:  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917im_/http:/jancharvat.cz/projects/type%20design/own/anje/data/anje%20hairline.png)\n\nAnje ExtraBold:  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917im_/http:/jancharvat.cz/projects/type%20design/own/anje/data/anje%20extrabold.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [test130130.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917/http:/typophile.com/files/test130130.pdf) | 458.68 KB |\n| [test130103.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917/http:/typophile.com/files/test130103.pdf) | 443.35 KB |\n| [dabelsky rosol-01.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917/http:/typophile.com/files/dabelsky%20rosol-01_0.png) | 33.35 KB |\n| [facts-04.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917/http:/typophile.com/files/facts-04_0.png) | 29.82 KB |\n\n",

Capital W doesn't have this problem, but the way the top of the middle stroke flares from (or tapers toward) the join may be conspicuous.\n\n"

But then I was unable to match the lowercase with them. I'll try make uppercase bit wider. Is there any common connection between capitals and lowercase in terms of proportions?\n\nThanks Jan\n\n"

At first I tried to apply more eccentric style to every crossbar, but there I was tightend with xtrabold cut, so it hasn't moved so much further. Then I made visually centered one. In comparision the eccentric one is more distractious then the normal one. What do you think is better?\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917im_/http:/jancharvat.cz/projects/type%20design/own/anje/data/anje%20crossbar%20test.png)  \nmore text here:  \n [http://jancharvat.cz/projects/type design/own/anje/data/crossbartest1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917/http:/jancharvat.cz/projects/type%20design/own/anje/data/crossbartest1.jpg)  \n [http://jancharvat.cz/projects/type design/own/anje/data/crossbartest2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212917/http:/jancharvat.cz/projects/type%20design/own/anje/data/crossbartest2.jpg)\n\nIn the begining there was some idea of making a font it with few differences. After nearly half a year they all dissappeared. Now looking backward I can see they were probably in most cases inappropriate. But I'm bit worried it's falling to ordinary, booring box of fonts...\n\nThank you for your time.  \nJan\n\n"
