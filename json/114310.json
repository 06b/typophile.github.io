      "content": "The combination Ctrl+Alt on Windows is equivalent to AltGr. You need a keyboard driver that maps this combination, though. A lot of Windows keyboards, especially non Latin, use Ctrl+Alt (and Ctrl+Alt+Shift) for rare characters in a given writing system. You have to be careful when creating such keyboard layouts though, because you can run into interference from Office hotkey combinations.\n\n"
