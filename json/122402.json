      "content": "I presume that your reference to 1981 refers to the date of the photograph. The building is obviously much older, perhaps pre-WWI.  \nAs for the sign I note the difference in the two \\_E\\_ letters.  \nSeems that part of the letter has broken off.  \nNot a new sign. But I wonder when it was installed.  \nUntil recent decades large sign letters were designed by various makers who did not necessarily base them on a specific font.  \nBut I trust someone will suggest some sources for matching individual letters.  \nThe low waist \\_R\\_ with a straight leg from where the bowl meets the vertical stroke, and the top heavy \\_S\\_ are a fair match to Erbar Grotesk Extra Garnitur introduced by Ludwig & Mayer Frankfurt in 1927.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417175709im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ErbarGroteskGarnitur1927SM_6491.jpg)\n  \nThis version of Erbar is not digitized.  \nDon\n\n"
