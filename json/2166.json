I haven't tried many fluid/organic versions, but perhaps there would be some possibilities there. One of the reasons that it is currently so geometric is because I have often heard that a good logo should fit within a square (for reducing, placement, compactness, etc).

My professor for Corporate Identity said that often times logos have to fit within a square for their applications (corner of letterhead, homepage, business card, t-shirt pocket.) I don't believe, and I don't think my professor believed that this was a hard fast rule, but that it was a starting place, and to venture out meant you had a good reason. Another way I have often heard this idea described is that \"a good logo should be able to roll down hill\". So anything that fits nicely into a square, like a circle, would roll (probably much better than a square). I think the main purpose of this kind of thinking was to encourage designers to consider the application limitations of a logo that has extreme horizontal or vertical dimensions. But yeah, how boring would it be if all logos were square?\n\n"

As I said, not my favorite logo, but what you do with it now will speak volumes also: type choice, stationary layout etc.   \n   \nI just had an idea: what if you were to design your idenity around the concept of identity. You could make the top of your letterhead into a government form with a box for your thumbprint (actually print each one), lines for your name and info (hand write it in), etc. There would certainly be room for wit in a gov't form! Same for business card & envelope. If you didn't want to fill in by hand, you could type them (ahhhhh. with an actual typewriter). If you are like me, you probably won't go through huge amounts of stationary so the crafty approach could save cash. This would certainly be memorable if it came across my desk.
