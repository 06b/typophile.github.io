  "content": "Hi guys,  \nI came across this site after long hours searching online for typography help.\n\nI have many questions, to begin with here's a little something about myself.  \nI'm a young web designer. I've been on the field for about six months so I'm still learning everything that heads towards me.  \nAbout two weeks ago I got my evaluation at work. I got some really good feedback on the type of work I do.  \nMy boss mention I should improve myself in typography. At first I was really shock to hear I needed improvement on the area where I thought I had it under control or at least thought I knew enough.\n\nI guess I'm completely clueless about typography.  \nRight now I have no idea how to start, what book to read or what classes should I take..etc.\n\nMy question is:  \nWhere is the starting line to typography?\n\nMore like baby steps for me right now. I really love my job. The only concerned is my lack of typography and I don't want this to effect my job.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n-KG\n\n",

Otherwise Bringhurst's <cite>Elements</cite> is a decent way in.\n\n"
