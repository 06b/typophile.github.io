  "content": "Hi,\n\nSome guys at my company are doing an online campaign for the surprisingly popular movie Paranormal Activity. Does anyone know what font is being using for the title? Make sure to have a good look at the 't'.\n\nSomething quite similar will be fine too.\n\nYou can se more here: [http://www.paranormalactivity-movie.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415120755/http:/www.paranormalactivity-movie.com/ \"http://www.paranormalactivity-movie.com/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415120755im_/http:/typophile.com/files/paranormal_font_3965.jpg)\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "That's a very good suggestion, but I think it will take some work to make it look alike. The font in the title seems lower and more square, and it looks a bit like the angle in the 'T' is more rounded in the bottom, than in Kautika? But that could be the Photoshopping, I guess.\n\n"
