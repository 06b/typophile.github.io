Here the task is more difficult, but it is not inconceivable to pair a Romantic Modernist serif with a Geometric Modernist sans serif such as **Futura** (c. 1925) or even **[Memphis](http://web.archive.org/web/20130718080729/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/memphis/)** (c. 1929).\n\nBetter still, **[Akzidenz Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20130718080729/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/AkzidenzGrotesk.html)** traces its geneology to the letterforms of Walbaum, and you may have an easier time harmonizing it with Le Corbusier.\n\n"
