Otherwise they're going to use Arial and I'm going to hang myself.   \n   \nThanks.\n\n",

I don't   \nknow a whole lot about it, but apparently it's the   \nmultiple master font that shows up in PDFs when   \na given font is not properly embedded.   \n   \nBest of luck Christopher.   \n   \nP.S. - We saw your poster at the AIGA SF poster show.   \nVery nice.
