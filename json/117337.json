  "content": "Traditional Arabic fonts have stems and curves going all over the place, compared to Latin, where verticals and horizontals dominate. Hinting Latin - I think - relies on such uniformity, but what about Arabic? Will an Arabic font benefit from hinting? My font has outlines of identical thickness - does this help the hinting process? Any hints (!) suggestions and examples most welcome as I know very little in practice about this.\n\n",

      "content": "If you want to hint the font using type 1 hinting it's pretty simple. You just have to follow the rules like latin, connect parallel horizontal nodes to each other and the same for the vertical ones. For dots just restrict multiple dots between two horizontal stems and vertical stems. Finally put one horizontal link at the descender and one at the ascender. TrueType hinting for an arabic typeface could be a headache. I don't know about that. Titus knows much more about this since hid did TrueType hinting on Nassim typeface which is being used on BBC Persian website.\n\n"
