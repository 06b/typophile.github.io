      "content": "There seems to be some distortion in your image. Is this printing on fabric?\n\nThe A is unusual for two reasons: it has the half top serif, and it has almost no serif on the right leg. The closest A I have found to this is [Hiroshige](http://web.archive.org/web/20090811084118/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/hiroshige/), but it doesn’t seem to be a very close match for other letters like the R and T. Another calligraphic serif is [Tiepolo](http://web.archive.org/web/20090811084118/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-tiepolo/), but I can’t say that’s a clear match either.\n\nAnyone else have any ideas?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
