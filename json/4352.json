She has a thing for Verdana, though I have doubts about using it in a broadcast format. The regular weight seems a little too thin for NTSC and buzzes at the smaller sizes. The bold is too hefty for credits. If only....there was a weight in between the two.   \n   \n You have to pack so much type into credit pages. And with the low res NTSC environment, it seems to require a simple open sans serif, like akzidenz.   \n   \n   \nIs there a font that is closer to verdana with a full range of weights?   \n   \nThanks!\n\n",
