  "content": "im interrested in making lo-fi handdrawn fonts. i've already drawn out large alphabets for many typefaces, each letter approximately the size of an 8.5 x 11\" sheet of paper, scanned them in, and vectorized them in adobe illustrator. is there any quick conversion available to turn these files into a fonts? is it possible to cut and paste into a font program? i know nothing of typographic software, what is available, what is possible. any leads in the right direction would be gold to me, so thank you all in advance. if it matters, i'm running mac os x (10.4.9)\n\n",

Fontographer and Fontlab can be found at Fontlab.com. Typetool also from Fontlab is sort of a Fontlab light and so they have a solution for every price range.\n\n"

Here is the feature comparison:\n\n[http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123243/http:/www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/ \"http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/\")\n\nSince you already have the letters in Illustrator as vectors, I would just paste them into whatever program you choose to go with. Otherwise, ScanFont is only $99 more.\n\nLearn Fontlab Fast is worth getting. I will help you get up to speed quickly, and much of the content applies to TypeTool.\n\n"
