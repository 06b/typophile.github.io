In many respects Concerto is a toned-down version of the exceptionally light Bernhard Fashion. Concerto makes use of extensive crossbars and rounded terminals. It has two sets of lowercase letters, the alternate letters being slightly higher and wider than the ones in the first set. Cap alternates are consistent in approach with the work of this talented poster artist. His characteristically flamboyant display style is now available where legibility and readability are big issues. Concerto is equipped with lining and non-lining figures.\n\nConcerto Rounded and Concerto Rounded Alts are also available in the OpenType Std format. Some new characters have been added to these OpenType versions. Advanced features currently work in Adobe Creative Suite InDesign, Creative Suite Illustrator, and Quark XPress 7. Check for OpenType advanced feature support in other applications as it gradually becomes available with upgrades.\n\n",
