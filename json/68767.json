  "content": "Hey all,\n\nI am doing some research on fonts that exist in a serif and a sans version.  \nOne example would be foundry's Foundry Form that exists as Foundry Form Sans and Foundry Form Serif.  \nAre there any other typefaces you can think of that exist in both versions?\n\nNext to that i would love to hear about morphing typefaces.  \nI guess im just diving into the world of flexible/dynamic type.  \nAnyone who can introduce me to that world and open the door for me?\n\nThanx!\n\n",
