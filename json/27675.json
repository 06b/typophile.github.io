I wonder what happened. ’Metron’ has been digitised by Frantisek Storm, in 2004, or so. But it vanished from his site, as well. Very strange. Maybe you want to contact Frantisek Storm directly? Oh, And if you do so, please reply in here with what happened. Thank you. )\n\nDav\n\n"

The drawings are meticulously done on transparent papers, signed and dated. I newer saw something like that in Rathousky’s inheritance. There are also many witnesses confirming the version of Mr. Tucny.  \nWe are working on a new, extended story to Metron and solving copyright issues. It’s going slowly, Mr. Tucny has over 80, and I’m working simultaneously on another projects, holidays, etc...\n\nThank you all for patience.\n\nFrantisek Storm, [www.stormtype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709012323/http:/www.stormtype.com/ \"www.stormtype.com\")\n\n"
