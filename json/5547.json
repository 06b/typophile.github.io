I've tried emailing him twice to buy a commercial license from the email address at [www.iconian.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016010559/http:/www.iconian.com/), but with no luck. After over two weeks waiting, I'm at a loss.   \n   \nDoes anyone have any ideas if he's still around and could pass on a message, or who might be able to point him here?\n\n",
