For me its a good example for a good working and charming textface with modern feeling. Its always the netherlands which (in my eyes naturally) produce those kinds of smooth (not slick) faces which strikes the eye in a positive sense when seen in a book. Just as Lexicon No2 for example and others.  \nArnhem is great.  \nGood link.\n\nStefan\n\n"
