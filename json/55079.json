Its spiky appearance that doesn't really match the roundness of the letters, so it looks like a foreign element. It also reminds me more of a pineapple or a tomato rather than a pomegranate.\n\nIf I were to chose between the two, I would too select the bottom one.\n\n"

First is the font outline, it seems to be taking away from the 'home' feeling you are after. Second is the placement of the 'flower'. I'd move it closer to the top of 'g' because right now the area between it and the 'r' looks rather cluttered.\n\n"

      "content": "epsilicon,  \nI took off the outline. I agree.  \nRegarding the placement of the flower: I wanted the flower to replace the ‘ear’ of the letter ‘g’. So there will be a smooth continuity from the letter ‘g’ to ‘r’.  \nDoes it still look clutter after removing the outline (#1)?  \n#2 & #3 are different versions of the flower placement. They look odd to me. (It is already odd as the flower is not aligned with the circle pivot..)  \nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks :-)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108204159im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pomegranate15a_5866.jpg)\n\n"

I'd also consider removing G's bottom-right extrusion, i.e. make it look like G in [Locator Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108204159/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/locator-display/black/characters.html).\n\n"

The new concept, in my opinion, feels more like a thick cut of steak.\n\nThe small flourish on the g's ear was brilliant! Adds a glint of magic. Like Miss Tiffany was saying the round shape of the _o_ may be better suited to the treatment. And, grow that sprout. Bring out this fun feature so people will actually see it.\n\n"

The version of it that you had in your original version was the closest to the real thing.\n\nAlso, the single color version is better between the last two .. that's unless you want to go with a high-contrast colors, like dark gray for the text and red for the extrusion (which could actually look quite nice).\n\n"
