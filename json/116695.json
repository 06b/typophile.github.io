I create this for my final year project and inspired by some Postrock-ish band.  \nlooking forward to your opinion, thanks a bunch!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [mlv.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203310/http:/typophile.com/files/mlv.PNG) | 23.76 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Looks quite original!\n\nThe rhythm strikes me as quite uneven. Try out some narrower versions of /A and /V, and fix the overly large space between /ID. Maybe reduce the spacing in general?\n\nDon't worry about kerning until you've got good base spacing. Use a font editor that makes spacing and kerning easy, such as Glyphs.\n\nTry punching a hole into the /V to make it less black, like you did for /A.\n\n"
