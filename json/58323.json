What's the story behind this image?  \nLike Zev, I'm not an illustrator, but I think the placement of the angel makes it ambiguous whether he's riding the lion or standing next to it. Also, if you refine the shape of the lion's forelegs, it will be more obvious that they don't belong to the angel.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130816085147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lion_Benjamin_Waterhouse_Hawkins_1860_5052.jpg)\n  \n_(Detail from drawing by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, 1860)_  \nTo make the angel more heroic as Zev suggests, try moving his torch-bearing arm forward so it's not superimposed on his head.

Is it so that people step out of these places?  \n\"El Angel y el Leon\" (the angel and the lion) is the name of a Roberto Negri´s sculpture located in Santiago de Chile. It was a gift from Italy to Chile for the celebration of its independence. It is not an invention, it is a sculpture, the drawing it is based on a photography of it.http://www.flickr.com/photos/escatologia/3461527828/sizes/o/  \nIf it is badly drawn is because it´s in development, and that is why it is posted here, so other people can comment what is right or wrong about it. These way I can improve it.  \nThe idea of using .org in the logo is because more than a publishing company (that publishes books) it is a independent colective of cultural spreading, that remarks it´s inspiration as a independent Organization, more than a commercial one. Besides it´s a webzine and also a independent publishing company, so is more important to remark the domain (URL).\n\nI will appreciate in the near future that the comments were a little bit more constructive and thoughtful, is a bit violent to receive non constructive critics and only disparaging or malicious ones.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130816085147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/angel_4343.jpg)\n  \nNew version, thanks for the comments.\n\nSome really important.

I agree with Altaira about the angle of the angel's neck.  \nI also like how the style of the lion's fire matches the torch.  \nI would angle the tip of the tail down and to the right slightly, to sort of fill (not completely) some of the negative space at the lion's ankle. Right now it is pointing directly at the leg. If you angle it down and to the right more, it will \"point\" to the words, helping to draw the eye down to the words.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n [www.coroflot.com/kate\\_dawson](http://web.archive.org/web/20130816085147/http:/www.coroflot.com/kate_dawson \"www.coroflot.com/kate\\_dawson\")\n\n"
