      "content": "I agree with Tom that I would prefer to see   \nall the types \"untouched\" or if touched,   \nat least one more combination.   \nBut as it concerns serif or sans serif   \nI would recommend to give more boldness   \nto the serif version before you judge which.   \nI think that you will have a very intersting   \nresult if you make the contrast a lot more,   \nplus I would see it in a more condensed version   \nand more tight spacing.   \n   \nAs for the \"f\" Tom suggets, I think is legible.   \n   \nchristos   \n   \nPS.

      "content": "David,   \n   \nThe (r) and the (m) seem too large/wide in comparison with the other characters. I'm sure it is a spacing issue. The open areas of those letters are larger than what you've left for the (s). The (o) seems to work in comparison to the (r) and the (m), but still the (f) and the (s) ... As Tom demonstrated, the (f) and (o) should perhaps not touch. and then add space in between the (sos). The arm of the (r) seems too large. The (f) seems too low, it is crowding the (o), and now that I notice this, maybe the (s) is crowding the (m)?   \n   \nTwo more thoughts. (1) What if the serifs were more slab like? (2) What if you add more contrast?   \n   \nI think I do prefer the sans, but I can see potential in the serif.\n\n"
