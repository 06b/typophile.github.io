  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently starting a new company as a graduation assignment together with a friend of mine, and we are looking for some feedback on a logo we designed. We are both developers and therefor not so good at designing a logo :)\n\nWe are going to develop mobile applications and games using Flash Lite. We came up with something and are wondering if you might have some critique.\n\nThanks in advance,  \nJasper\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108213230/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_1.png) | 7.46 KB |\n\n",

The only reason I ask is that \"FUNK\" seems blurry. You should create logos as vectors so they will scale better.\n\nThe star is a little too far into the 'K' for my liking. Also, you may lose details in the phone buttons in small or low-resolution environments (such as on a phone).\n\n- Lex\n\n"
