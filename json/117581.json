  "content": "Hello everybody!\n\nI have just started my graphic design course and the assignments require us to get feedback from other people. My current assignment is to design a wine label and get feedback.\n\nIf anyone can help and give me some constructive criticism on my designs, it will be greatly appreciated! I'm still getting used to photoshop, illustrator etc etc. So please take it easy on me and please keep in mind that these are just quick drafts to give you an understanding of how I want my designs to look.\n\nTHANK YOU!

While you may get some answers, you probably would get more feedback in a forum targeting designers.\n\nI will say your grapes look distorted and shouldn't.\n\nNow, if you have a type-related question, this is the place to come -- and you're always welcome.\n\n"

If not learn bezier curves by trying to reproduce this lettering curve by curve. The yellow outline with the red inside is too busy - Make the outline stroke thinner. Better still make the outline thicker with a lighter color, but do not add an outline stroke.The thin red type on black is illegible - use a thicker font and/or much lighter red.  \nAnd the grapes are distorted - why not use illustrator's brush mode to make a simple illustration for the grapes instead this nondescript photo?  \nGood luck.\n\n"

      "content": "Welcome to Typophile.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the grapes don't look right, it looks like the proportions have been altered by reduction of the height.\n\nAnd in the small type, the combination of burgundy type on a black background can be difficult to read because of the low contrast, especially for older customers, or for anyone in dim lighting. I'd suggest a lighter type color (maybe that light yellow you're using) for the small type, and switching to a bolder script.\n\n"

      "content": "_These forums are for people whose primary interest is type and type technology, not general design._\n\nWhy? Shouldn't people who are interested in type also be interested in how it's used? Type doesn't exist in a vacuum. Maybe I'm biased because I'm a graphic designer, but I feel the best type designers are the ones who understand how people use type — people like Kris Sowersby, Tobias Frere-Jones, Erik Spiekermann, etc.\n\n"

      "content": "In addition to the feedback already given, I wouldn't make such prominent use of script faces. With every text you add in script, the other texts become less prominent and less impressive. You might want to use a script for the name and use a roman typeface for the lines you have set in a script typeface. You need to focus more on the hierarchy of the typography.\n\nI also have to ask why you would want to censor our feedback. Why should we go easy on you? So you don't have much experience yet, I don't think you should expect us to be vile in our comments either way. If I ask for feedback I want it uncensored. It might hurt, but I will learn a lot more from it. By \"going easy\" on you, you might not get the most out of feedback.\n\n"

How are you going to appeal to that person? Since it's an Australian wine, maybe you can look into using Australian typefaces?\n\nIt's a blend, right, or at least that's what the name says? Maybe you can do something playing off of that — maybe the word mark is a script made up of multiple differently-colored \"threads\" that twist together to make the letterforms.\n\n"
