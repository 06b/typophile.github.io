      "content": "Hi Addison,   \n   \njust a couple of spontaneous thoughts as they come to my mind:   \n   \n1) First off, is that a comma after \"catering\"?   \n   \n2) Personally, I'm not too much fond of off the peg letters along curves (it's something different with handmade letters) and the combination with an cursive-all-caps-with-expert-T's setting doesn't tend to have me change my mind. To me, especially the cursives seem too much in combination with the arced text. The T's as such are nice. The curved text does look less serious than the straight one.   \n   \n3) I'm a bit undecided about whether the sharp, high-contrast letters (\"Enviting Events\") go good together with the uniform stroke width and the sketchy freehand feeling of the graphic. They might, I think. I guess I'm just not too happy with the letters - for some reason I don't yet know how to elaborate.   \n   \njpg\n\n"

(because of the color change.)   \n   \nAlso, you might take a look at some flourishes, such as the ones   \nthat accompany Bickham Script.   \n   \nI think you could do something flourish-ish with a spoon   \nand fork, etc.   \n   \nbj\n\n"

Thanks.   \n   \nThe serif type is Storm's Antique Moderne, and I was going for contrast between the type and the mark -- kind of an eclectic feel I guess (and I'm a sucker for those swash Ts). Perhaps a type that relates better to the graphic will do the trick... I'll try some things.   \n   \nSorry I didn't mention before -- they specifically wanted to stay away from \"swirly and frilly.\" I've explored some options with the two Es and wasn't happy, but I'll revisit those sketches.

      "content": "Hi Addison   \n   \nI think the drawing is perfect and I would keep it. I also like the type choice (the second arrangement, not the type on a curve) and the contrast of styles between the casual graphic and the formal type. I think this works because the people planning these kind of events (your client's customers) are going for this combination of casual elegance in their parties. (Although that's just a guess because I'm definitely not part of that world.)   \n   \nEither element by itself would be either too casual or too formal, but combined they really play off each other nicely.   \n   \nThe graphic also has a soft, \"girly\" kind of vibe which I think would appeal to the kind of person planning parties like this.   \n   \nThe frame around the outside of the whole thing -- I don't see how it adds anything. I thought maybe that was to indicate the edge of a business card (is it?).   \n   \nThe brackets around the second statement add an element of whimsy that I think works here. I might think about colors other than black and red. Maybe if the red wasn't so bright but more of a burgandy, which might look good paired with a gray (instead of the black).   \n   \nOverall I think you are very close to a really nice solution for your target audience.   \n   \nRob\n\n"

It's been extremely helpful.   \n   \nAs far as working with difficult clients, I've had some real hum-dingers. It's hard not be offending sometimes while trying to be helpful. With these women, for instance, my strongest complaint was people who only hear the name won't be able to find them -- they will look under \"i\" in the yellow pages instead of \"e\". Their name will eventually become, \"Enviting Events spelled with an e instead of an i.\" But it was their idea and they do not want to let go of it. It's frustrating.   \n   \n-Addison\n\n"
