He sett up his press in Watkinsville, GA and was considered the dean of avocational typefounding in his time. He has so much knowledge of the status of the matrix holdings of the great foundries of Europe. He cut a 30 pt [Civilite](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018023746/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Civilite) for [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018023746/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf). Without setting out to do so, he was one of the finest teachers in both the private press and avocational typefounding fields. In an act characteristic of his great generosity, he had in the last year of his life made gifts of his typefounding machines, matrices and effects to promising young people.  \nDuensing passed the evening of November 9, 2006 after a lengthy battle with ill health.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Where to Buy Lead Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018023746/http:/typophile.com/node/932)  \n [Paul Duensing Passes](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018023746/http:/typophile.com/node/29428)\n\n",
