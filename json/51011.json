I need an few figures from you guys on how much your would charge for something such as a letterhead, business card and logo design?? My client is starting up his new consulting company and needs this designing. He asked me how much it would cost, so I said, you give me a fair price and we can go from there, he came back with £200. I was thinking more along the lines of £300/£400. I did some work recently for his hair salon which he was very impressed by, and we also get along great. But, it has potential for more and more commissions as he likes my work a lot. I also charge by the project. I don't want to scare him off by overcharging cause he is a polite guy and don't want him to feel like I am ripping him off.\n\nPeace guys!\n\nDahl.\n\n",

Tell him that if he wants a £200 identity, he can go buy a stock identity online. Otherwise, give him an estimate based on your hourly rate and then charge him for the work you do.\n\n"

The only problem is that he knows I don't have a lot of experience with clients and my client folio isn't huge, so he is using this against me.\n\nThis is what he replied to in my email.\n\nHi Daniel\n\nDont't take this the wrong way as it's only friendly advice, as you're a nice guy. Clearly, you have talent to produce what you do without formal design education. I offered you the work just because I thought it may build your portfolio to include work for actual clients. Although I'm not a designer, I have briefed agencies myself and through large corporates from anything as small as an A6 flier, to a £2m re-brand of a global bank, so I understand that a logo with letterhead and business card should be one man-day, which makes your daily rate £350. If you had 5 years experience you could absolutely start charging £350-450 p/d (outside London). Just by way of contrast, the best design agency in Derby that I used charged their senior designer out at £400 p/day and that included their overheads.\n\nI've had to build up myself and the best thing you can do is to start to get some real examples in your portfolio that shows you can design in different styles against a client brief. That does mean, in the early days, offering lost leads and heavily discounted rates to build up. When you have the experience you can demand the higher fees.\n\nSo I'm not undervaluing you but I don't value the logo over £200 and would find a designer who work for that fee.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nOk, so what do you guys think of this??\n\nThanks for the advice so far.\n\n"

You've even given him a fixed price!\n\n• this comment of his I find quite disrespectful: \"I offered you the work just because I thought it may build your portfolio to include work for actual clients.\" Clients will always try the \"I'm doing you a favour line...\" don't buy it. Seriously!\n\n• He makes a point of £200 for the logo, this could be fair. Solely for the logo. I would take that, and tell him to find another designer to produce the stationary. The latter is the labour intensive part, liaising with printers, proofing costs and the general logistics involved. Also, the logo will take you further than the stationary folio wise...\n\n• If your doing it right, corporate stationary shouldn't be done in a day...what exactly does he think his £2m global bank rebrand went on? The one day designer doing the whole thing for £400, is your average kall kwik mac monkey - which goes back to James' point about off the shelf...\n\n• Lost leads is just stupid. Only work free or cheap if it's something close to your heart.\n\n• Don't be afraid to say no...because you'll be laughing your socks off when you see what he gets for £200.\n\n"

Such a shame.\"\n\nYep.\n\nOne story that has always left a thorn on my side was being newly out of school working at a firm and volunteering for a local AIGA portfolio review event. In the evening, they had a panel of respected professional designers on stage so students could ask questions. When the questions petered out, I offered one up to keep things rolling along the lines of \"When should a person start thinking and talking about salary with a potential employer?\"\n\nNow, I thought that was a really good question, as in my years of college, the topic never came up. In fact, the first time it came up with on my first interview where the president of the company asked me what I wanted. Which, of course, is the worst time to suddenly think \"oh crap! I never thought about that!\"\n\nWell, the panel seemed unanimous in saying that it was an absurd question and salary should be the last thing talked/worried about.\n\nSadly, 10+ years into my career and a half dozen jobs later, I realize they were right. It's still the norm for salary to be discussed at the tail end of a job negotiation.\n\nMaybe I'm way off base, but I just find it completely backwards. It's naive to think we all work because we love the work. We may, but we work to make money.\n\nGrr.\n\nAnyways, so yea, stick to your guns. You are worth what you are worth and nothing less and you don't want a client that is going to try go talk you out of that simple fact.\n\nAlong terminals great pricing story, the one I always liked is: Call up your local licensed, highly recommended plumber and ask them their hourly rate. Charge at least that much.\n\n\"I can’t see him finding better for £200 as mentioned.\"\n\nThat's the route I'd take. Let him find a solution for that price. He'll either a) love it, in which case you'll learn that he wasn't necessarily interested in quality anyways or b) he'll come running back to you asking you to fix it for him.\n\n"

      "content": "Maybe I'll put the things short and frank. Getting the job done - with desired quality! - is one thing, negotiating the price is something waaay different.\n\nOne of the hardest things I have to do is explaining clients exactly **why** they should pay such price. At least in my experience, the client most of the time does not care how big is your portfolio, neither is so much interested in high quality, but prefers to make a 'winning deal' - i.e. getting best results for nearly nothing. If the quality is most important factor, client should accept your quote and discuss specific quality requirements, not drive a hard bargain.\n\nHow you define how much your work is worth paying for? Well, my principle is never to underestimate yourself. If you're satisfied with £300, ask £400-450, so you can have the chance to lower your price to accomodate the client's needs (if it's really worth it). I do not believe this is the case though.\n\nSo, when dealing with slimy guys trying to sell you bullshit in the manner of '_I'm doing you a favour_', let them rot in their slime. Such relations with the client are simply not worth it, and unsurprisingly often lead to subpar designs. Unless I desperately need these money, I would turn down his offer, and even ridicule him for the last mail you quoted - quite close to his own manner of patronizing. My reply would be '_So you still cannot find someone to do it for such price? Keep looking, good luck in finding one_'. I'm not the most polite guy, when my effort is underestimated.\n\nIn fact you in my opinion have made already two mistakes: letting him to quote a base price you can discuss later, and demonstrating you have 'not that huge' portfolio. My policy is always to give my quote first, and then negotiate. Unless, of course, you desperately need the money...\n\n"

I am very proud of it. The only down fall is that most of my work in there is personal projects and not varied enough. Thanks to Sharon and fi for taking the time to look at my work, and I appreciate the confidence boost to believe in myself more.\n\nThis guy obviously doesn't value his new business to much if he is willing to spend £200 on these jobs. After all, his logo, etc will be representing his business. After much thought and reading on here, I did tell him that I wasn't interesting in a reasonable way, but I was very tempted to tell him my real heated feeling.\n\nMy reply.\n\nAfter much more thought and loads of advice from fellow designers, I have decided to  \nreject the offer of £200. For some reason you seem to think that cause I lack commercial experience I have to charge a low price no matter what my standard is. For £200, you will not get a a logo, letterhead and business card designed to a high standard. You must really undervalue your new business pretty low if you are gonna trust some poor designer to design this stuff for you at a price of £200. If you want to pay that for a logo alone you will be lucky to find a stock logo. You know the fact I don't have commercial experience and use that to base the price on which is totally undervalued. Jason, I like you and were pretty much on the same level when it comes to knowing where to take a design, but I can't work at this offer. Also, it isn't a one day job, the logo will take days to research, etc and that's excluding the business cards and letterhead. Would you really want me to do all that in a day?? Good design takes time.\n\nI don't think you realize how much effort went into that flyer I designed for eye candy. I spent so much time on that and I really hope you appreciate it. It also should show you that I can produce work for clients.\n\nYou have your rates for your salon and I have my rates.

Like \"a 50% off introductory offer\".\n\nSay I want a $2,500 for a job. I'll price it at $5k, and offer \"a 50% off introductory offer\".\n\nI'll list the cost of the various item, totalling well over $5k. I'll write that the group discount for all the items brings the price down to $5k. 50% off is $2,500.\n\nIn this way, the customer thinks he got a bargain, and you get the amount you want.\n\nMy teacher and mentor in college taught me, \"shoot high\" - for you can always lower your price. If you start out too cheap, and raise the price later, you'll lose the customer forever.\n\nIf you start out higher, you will be perceived as high end and quality. If you start out too low, you will be perceived as cheap, not so good, and barely professional.\n\nIn your specific case, estimate howw many hours it took to do the job, and add any additional hours that the customer would think it should take at most.

A Designer of what?  \n**Me:** Well, what you see around you, posters billboards, books, signage, packages..websites (on rare occasions)  \n**Them:** Ah ! So you are a webdesigner!  \n**Me:** Well not so much, I dabble on occasion but..  \n**Them:** Hey, you know what, my daughter needs a logo for her band, I still have a few minutes before I have to head back, can you make one for her before I leave?  \n**Me:** Well, see now, designing a logo takes a lot of effort, and it’s not just a mark, what we do is create identity systems..  \n**Them:** Don’t be ridiculous, I see logos every day, they are tiny things, you can make a dozen in five minutes. I’d do it myself, but I can’t draw, tell you what, just draw me a picture and I’ll put in the text and everything, My cousin showed me how to do shadows and other cool things in Photoshop!  \n**Me:** Identity design is probably the most difficult discipline within the field of graphic design, it requires one to sift through countless concepts to arrive at a finished, concise form that embodies a whole score of ideas, is unique, and pleasing to the eye. You have to appeal to the target, and after all, a logo is just a tip of the iceberg. A logo by itself is just a mark, what makes it magic, is an expansive and detailed identity system, that establishes a particular style to all areas of visual communication, from architecture to the color of your toilet paper.  \n**Them:** Well, that's just a load of corporate nonsense isn’t it? It’s just a way for you guys to raise your price. All I need is a simple little logo. I don’t even mind if it only has two colors, and I can add the shadow myself. I was going to order it from one of those online logo places, but they are charging $50! Isn’t that ridiculous? 50 bucks for a tiny picture. Who’d ever pay that?

It looks pretty good, but I don’t like the green.  \n**Me:** The green is there to blah-blah-blah... but it doesn’t matter. What we have to decide, is which of the three do we pick and work on further.  \n**Them:** Oh, I think the left one is the best of the bunch, but I thought about it some more this past week, and I think we should have strawberries. I’ve asked my friends and my partner, they all agree, that strawberries are a good positive image.  \n**Me:** Eh?  \nThem: And here is a font that I fond on the web, it’s modern and forward-looking.  \n**Me:** But..  \n**Them:** So, if you could just take that design on the left, put a strawberry on top, and write the text in ZZ\\_Type\\_Kool, we’ll be golden.  \n**Me:** Hang on a minute... /Writes up a 2-page essay explaining the value of quality design, the difference between kitsch and avantgard, the meaning of professionalism and the role of a designer as conceptual communicator./  \n**Them:** /After skipping through to the least sentence in the essay/ Stop being difficult! I am paying you money, and should be entitled to get what I ask. I even found you the font (ZZ\\_Type\\_Kool) so you don’t even have to search for one. My insurance company needs a pink strawberry on top of a shining golden spear, and I expect to get it. If $100 I paid is not enough, I can add 20 more for your troubles.  \n**Me:** So why do you even need a designer?  \n**Them:** I can’t draw strawberries. Look, I’ve worked with other designers before, and it was always very easy, I tell them what I want, they do it and get paid. See what they did for me? /shows a juggernaut of piss and glitter/  \n**Me:** But that’s horrible!  \n**Them:** All designers say that about the work of all other designers!

Daniel hasn't had the opportunity to build a portfolio of student work (at his own expense), so the client is doing him a favour by offering to pay for helping develop his portfolio with a real-world project, whereas if Daniel had gone to design school, he would have had to pay for developing a portfolio of imaginary projects himself.\n\nWhen you buy services, don't you pay according to your perception of the provider's worth, and save money when you can?

As you point out, you have 8 years of design training and education, plus actual practice.\n\nAs I tried to stress, customers often pay according to perception and years of paid experience.\n\nYou are young. That is a blessing in itself, worth much more than getting paid a lot for a job.\n\nUnfortunately, age does work against you; if this is one of your early jobs, customers feel that it is worth a smaller amount than you, like a certain £ amount per hour. So, the total of £200, divided by the number of hours the customer thinks you needed to do the job.\n\nEven though you may feel its worth a higher amount, I found after many years of paid experience, reputation and recommendation is valuable more than the money of one job. A happy customer recommends you over and over. A good name goes out far and wide. This leads leads to endless more jobs. As time goes on, your age and paid experience increases, and you will receive more and more for every job. The most important factor is a happy customer.\n\n"

This may or may not even be influenced by the quality of your work to date, depending on what client you are working with and how design savvy they are.\n\nIn reference to this perceived value you have made a couple of huge mistakes. Firstly, you asked HIM to tell YOU how much to pay you! Secondly, your correspondence to him was quite unprofessional. This further goes to downgrade your perceived value.\n\nI agree with Nick's comments too - you have no formal design education and a small portfolio so you cannot charge $3000 for an identity system because you cannot provide that level of service and experience to deliver value on that.\n\nWhat I would have done in this situation is go right in with a price that will pay you for your hours. Figure out what a decent hourly rate would be, say £15 per hour (which is $24), and lets say you determine that it is a weeks work for you (£15 x 40 = £600). Quote him this price and let him know what your rate is and that there is no way you can complete the project in less time, nor would you work for less than that per hour. Give him a comparison of a professional rate, say at £35 per hour would be £1800.\n\nIf you always try to compete on price, there will always be someone who will undercut you. You must compete on value and service and be competitive on price. If someone purely wants to talk price, get out.\n\n"

I was in toronto on Tuesday for DesignThinkers, it's a shame I hadn't realized you were in toronto or I could have met you!\n\nBut you raise a number of great points about education versus experience. I was going to point out the RGD as an example of quality assurance.\n\nIn Ontario Canada, where Nick and I live, we have an organization called the RGD, Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario. No, you don't need to have any formal deign education to join the RGD, but you must pass a test proving your knowledge is at a certain level on-par with our current college design education.\n\nIt's relatively easy and possible for somebody trained elsewhere besides Ontario, to come here and take the test and pass and become RGD, just as it's painless for somebody with life experience to take the test and become and RGD.\n\nWhat having that title allows you is a bargaining token. It doesn't matter whether you went to school or not, if you're RGD they have some assurances that you do \\*know\\* your stuff, and you can use that by saying: hey, I'm RGD, what's that worth to you to have a tested and proven designer working for you.\n\nI'm not surewhat similar groups or organizations exist where you are, but that might be a sort of proof of your skill, as well as some insurance that could make potential clients feel reassured that you do know your stuff, even if you don't have an extensive portfolio to show them.\n\nAs for getting a portfolio, I recognize your need to eat, and I don't want to discourage you from professional work, but I will share a little secret with you. I have done professional work, school work and personal work, and the work I find is often the strongest is the personal work. Why? Because I'm more passionate about the charities and causes I'm providing the work for.\n\nI have been involved in a number of open-source projects who are starving for designers, you can literally take your pick, but the oppurtunities and experience I have gotten in 3 years of open-source development were equal to 3 years of professional work in jobs I couldn't get yet. Game design, UI design and software user experience design.\n\nI would strongly recommend you go find a church organization, a charity, a student group at a local school or an open-source project that you identify with, and one you feel passionate about, and design a few posters, identities, web layouts or whatever they need.\n\nI hope this advice helps, I'm a young designer myself and I'm sure my advice is worth pennies compared to some of the greats on this forum :-)\n\n"

We are selling objects of value that, if done well and taken care of, will outlast us all. Every time we agree to sell our product for less than what it's worth, we drive down the value of design for everyone and give more business to the $50 logo clowns.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with giving a price break from time to time but your estimate should reflect the application of that discount so that the true value of the product is known and future expectations are set. Set up a standard discount for start-up companies or non-profit organizations and stick to it. Establish a top-of-the-head average price point for basic products so that you can speak confidently about it when asked.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that every hour you spend working on an undervalued job is an hour lost that could be spent on something of value. There is nothing worse than giving up a weekend to a client that doesn't respect your time and talent.\n\nFinally, check out one of the many pricing guidelines available. My personal favorite has been the \"Pricing & Ethical Guidelines Handbook\", published yearly by the Graphic Arts Guild. It will answer just about any question you can throw at it and will give you the insight and confidence you need to talk about pricing and process with clients.\n\nGood luck!\n\nTM™\n\n"
