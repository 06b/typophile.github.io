I want to pair a sans-serif with a sans. That is because the red flipped \"Ǝ\" is indispensable and refers to EMINƎM. So I basically have these four combinations(please ignore the kerning for now). I was hoping you guys could tell me how good and bad they are, and suggest best pairings too.  \nThanks\n\n",

Maybe try a lowercase style y with a vertical right side. Something more like this, but, you know, done properly rather than quickly:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418164349im_/http:/typophile.com/files/shady_5614.JPG)\n\n"

And I agree with what you said about the flipped \"E\". I just quickly traced it from the logo and used as it was. I will adjust it to the proportions and weight of Bank Gothic. Thanks guys.\n\n"
