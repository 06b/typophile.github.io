  "content": "Hi all,\n\nMy [Inconsolata](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011213234/http:/levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) feels just about finished now. I've added more or less all the characters requested, so that the basic Latin-1, -2, and -0 should be covered, as well as some other glyphs needed for TeX.\n\nWhat I'd like now is critique of the fit and polish of the font. I'd especially like feedback on the accents and auxiliary characters, since I don't use those as much. I tried to follow the advice of Adam Twardoch and Briem, but not speaking Icelandic or Polish, it's hard for me to know how successful I have been. The font is available for downloading in various formats, so it should be pretty easy to use.\n\nHinting is very minimal. That means the rendering won't be super-sharp, but at least I have confidence that the shapes won't be horribly distorted, and it looks pretty nice in Linux on my 24\" Dell monitor.\n\nBefore people lay into it, I know the \"A\" is stylistically a little out of step with other glyphs such as \"V\". But I can't bring myself to let go of it. I like the little touch of Eagle mixed in with all the other eclectic influences.\n\nThanks much in advance (width).\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [showing.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011213234/http:/typophile.com/files/showing.pdf) | 31.53 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "i like this quite a lot. what i like best is that it doesn't feel like a monowidth font when reading it. excellent! I find the sharp apex of the A distracting. Are those spurs in places supposed to be there? they feel a bit like they're there on mistake; I like them, but the seem inconsistent. Some of the accents (acute, grave and the lc caron) feel dimuitive to me. I think you did a good job on the eth, but i'm not a native Icelandic reader. Also, [the capital Eng](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011213234/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/uppercase.htm) is the preferred shape for Hausa, but not for Sami (if that's important). more later...\n\n"

      "content": "Wow...I'm really impressed. This is really pleasant, and with the details on letters like g, t, and v it even approaches friendly.\n\nI agree with Paul that I don't understand the logic behind the inconsistent use of the microserifs, especially in the uppercase (why on the top of the H but not the bottom? why on the lower arm of the Z but not the L? etc). I also think that the microserif on the r should be a little more blunt (like on the s).\n\nWhile I'm on the lc r, I would think again about removing the foot serif that I saw in Xavier Noria's screenshot; I kind of liked it and it helped fill in the whitespace a little bit. On the other hand, I understand your desire to keep it as sans-y as possible.\n\nAlso, Is there a way to translate the subtle curvature of the lowercase diagonals to their uppercase counterparts to soften them up just a bit?\n\nI admire how you've paid attention to how this looks in various programming languages on screen, and not just in natural langauges on paper.\n\nDavid\n\n"
