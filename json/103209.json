Everyone said it doesn't have to be this exact font but it would be great if it was close. Any recommendations for a \"really close\" font?\n\nThanks again!!!\n\n",

I'm also convinced it'd be very hard to find a free and legal alternative to it, the design is really too specific and I'm afraid you'll find only illegal copies or rip-offs.
