A couple in the classic set look suspiciously like ITC Benguiat and Eurostyle. Of course under different names. They do ask for reviews. Any takers\n\n",

Save your money.\n\n"

Upon closer inspection of the Broadway Rip Off font called Brando, they are indeed simply re-scanned, retraced, versions and you can rest assured they may as well cease distribution or claim bankruptcy now . . .   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"
