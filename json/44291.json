I’ve been asked to help with an Interiors/Homes magazine redesign and we are looking for a font for the masthead as well as the headlines inside. The magazine is called Insite. Currently the masthead is set in OPTI aqueduct but it’s now looking a bit dated and tired and heavy. We want something more timeless, elegant, contemporary and strong. Headline and masthead fonts don’t necessarily have to be the same.\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\n [‹ AS Level Graphics Exam Review](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423212910/http:/typophile.com/node/44221 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type Battle 21: FontStruct ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423212910/http:/typophile.com/battle21 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
