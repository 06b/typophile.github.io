Thirty-eight full-color reproductions illustrate the photographs, designs, drawings, and photographs which were part of the design process, as well as related posters and illustrations from the last thirty years of Hidy's work.\n\nFor more details, please visit [http://www.katranpress.com/mentoring](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013132100/http:/www.katranpress.com/mentoring \"http://www.katranpress.com/mentoring\")\n\n",
