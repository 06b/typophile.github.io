  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am reading James Felici's _The Complete Manual of Typography_ and at one point he talks about the missuse of _Times_. He goes into comparing the length of different lines of type made up of 26 letters —from A to Z— to show that _Times_ is a very condensed type. What I don't understand is that he says that the average length of a line of type should be around 13 em(s). I though em(s) was (were) a relative mesure.\n\n",

      "content": "Sebastien, I think you have misread Felici. On p. 130 he says \"the lower case of a \\*standard\\* text face is 13 ems long.\" He doesn't say it \"should be\", and doesn't say that narrower or wider faces are \"wrong\". He cites Times as an example of a narrower face.\n\nHe explains, \"Once the alphabet length of a typeface diverges more than 5 percent from the 13-em standard, you will probably have to adjust your point size and measure.\" (Meaning, adjust from his rule of thumb that the maximum measure in picas is three times the point size.) He says that \"27 characters is the minimum line length, 40 the optimum, and 70 the maximum.\"\n\nBringhust has a somewhat different view, explaining that 45 to 75 characters is satisfactory for a single column of a seriffed face in a text size, with 66 ideal. If you have discontinuous text with extra leading, you can go longer.\n\nFor multiple column Bringhurst recommends 40 to 50 characters. (Bringhurst has a convenient table showing the relationships between alphabet width and measure.)\n\nIn any case, Felici makes clear that there is an interaction between the width of the typeface, a good measure and the leading. These have to be considered together, and a good match found for the page size you are setting on. What is best will be influenced by the width of the typeface, the x-height, whether there are serifs or not, and other factors. So in practice you need to experiment with a particular typeface and page size until you find a good solution. And finding a good solution on size, measure, and leading is, I think, the most important aid to achieving a readable text, in addition to having a decently readable typeface.\n\n"

The captions for the [figure 5.2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018053044/http:/www.lunchdesign.be/site/felici.html) clearly reads —_The “standard” width for the lowercase alphabet of a text is 13 ems._— What I don't get, and I am probably slow, is why the ems are used as a fixed and universal value in this case when Felici writes on page 24 —_The fundamental relative unit in typography is the em_.— and just before that— _Relative units have no fixed value in terms of absolute units such as picas, inches, or millimeters._— I'd like to understand before I continue with the book.\n\n"
