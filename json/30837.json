I prefer words, generally, but that is a good point about the internationalism of numbers. I might offer a Lino-numeric version of larger sets, if demand dictates in non-english markets.\n\nNear as I can tell, in non-OpenType compliant applications, at least until Vista comes out, one can’t group sub-types reliably, aside from the Bold, Bold-Italic and Italic stylings.\n\nHowever, in this case I am assuming that those who are using OT aware apps are “pickier” consumers, and they get the cleanest, most detailed, accurate names and nicest grouping (all tucked under basic face name). Similar to #2.\n\nThe non-OT apps will then show a lengthy approximation, broken into several entries, like:\n\n[facename] [cutname]  \n[facename] [cutname] [width (if applicable)]  \nAnd then one would just use the “ **B** ” and “_I_” buttons in those sort of apps to access the bold and oblique faces.\n\nAnd when Vista comes out, they will display as something confusing and different.

It says nothing about being cryptic, just short, and I think even those here who liked #2 could figure out the TLA’s. OT fields just don’t pigeonhole me into the Bold/Italic choice, and modern computers (that would implement OT) have resolutions of 1024\\*768 and up commonly.\n\nIn the “classic” name fields, everything will look about the same, except that I substitute “Italic” for “Oblique”, as it rumored that people may have problems otherwise.\n\n**- Or -**\n\nI would! On !Square Engine, the cryptic abbreviations are totally gratuitous fun.\n\n—  \nThey way adobe does fonts is really great to know. It isn’t simply the scale of them and their output, but things like you communicating the tech philosophies that makes them a standard-bearer. Free dev tools help too! ;)  \n—\n\nWithout a mac in the house these days, I am not sure how they render font names outside adobe apps (which, I imagine are almost identical in this to their PC equivalents). I’m guessing something more advanced than 2K/XP. From what I’ve seen, however, everyone with a pre-OSX machine understands that it might not be 100% cool with modern software. Well, actually I don’t know anyone anymore with a pre-OSX machine. Does anyone have experience or a white paper about OSX default name display?\n\n"

If you don’t do anything special in FontLab, these will be set the same as their Windows equivalents, and you’ll be stuck back at the four-member family model. (But there’s another option, so keep on reading.)\n\nApps getting “Classic” menu names will use Mac name ID 18 if present. (FontLab’s “Mac Name” under “OpenType-specific names.”)\n\nAdobe apps use Win name IDs 16 and 17 on both platforms. We consider those the typographically savvy names. (In FontLab: OT Family Name and OT Style Name.)\n\nNote that if name IDs 16 and 17 are not present, name IDs 1 and 2 get used instead. So if they’re the same, they can be omitted. (FontLab does this automatically.)\n\nNote that in Adobe fonts, Mac name IDs 1 and 2 usually correspond to Win name IDs 16 and 17. However, 16 and 17 have a slightly longer length limit than 1 and 2 (I think it’s 63 or 64 characters, instead of 31 or 32 characters). FontLab can set this up automatically if you check the option under “Generating OpenType & TrueType” for “use the OpenType names as menu names on Macintosh.”\n\nWell, I hope that was involved enough!\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
