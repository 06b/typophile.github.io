  "content": "Hi,   \nI'm a student working on a logo for a personal identity project. I'm attempting a playful, hand-drawn treatment of my name as a logo. Before I move on to using color, I am trying to address a couple of issues.   \n   \nFirst, something seems a little \"off\" about my letter forms. I cannot seem to put my finger on it, and I was hoping some of the more trained eyes here could help me out.   \n   \nSecondly, I think the logo should be for 'Jason Yates Design\" not just \"Jason Yates\", as just my name seems a little too personal. I would like to hear some thoughts on that, and if my treatment of the additional line of text is appropriate.   \n   \n   \n ![personal logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121720im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33432.gif)\n\n",

I have tried curving it up and down (top and bottom right). Maybe I need to walk away for this for a while, because no one of the three really stands out (although none of them seem bad to me, either)   \n   \n ![jasonyates2](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121720im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33437.gif)\\</font\\>\n\n"

      "content": "Jason, I like the unifying quality that the common stroke has through A, T, and E, but it's easy to see \"Yales\" instead. Or \"Tates\" for that matter.   \n   \nYou might want to further distinguish the Y by making the bowl of the J smaller or perhaps changing to a script-style (right-side spine) Y.   \n   \nHad you considered making the lc \"ate\" more script-style, with a monocular a whose tail connected to the body of the t rather than the cross? You could connect the A and T at the baseline and the T and E using the cross.\n\n"

      "content": "I think it makes much more sense to have the \"design\" as a font, to offset the playfulness of the \"Jason Yates\". The former is a craft, the latter is a person, so that makes for a nicely expressed duality. And of the three you have up there, Eurostile is best, although it seems a bit too rigid (and too light).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Jason -- as a cartoonist, I have the feeling that your logo says cartoonist more than it does designer. Lettering is difficult to get just right and if you don't, you shoot yourself in the foot. Here are a couple of samples of very good lettering in the style you've used, though they are lighter in weight. Get the feeling for the complete alphabet and be careful of hooking letters together unless you can do it in a pleasing way. Witty is even better. I suppose I must say that these examples appear courtesy of the advertisers who commissioned them.   \n   \n ![baby oil](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121720im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33466.jpg) ![Life Savers](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121720im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33467.jpg)\n\n"

What good would a designer be if their logo can't even convey properly what they do?   \n   \nI will go back and try something in the same spirit as what I have now, but says 'design' more than 'doodle'\n\n"

I have tried revising these forms, and they all come out either too caligraphic, or begin to look too rigid.   \n   \nHere, I have taken many of your suggestions, switching the 'y', and playing with how I connect the letters. I need to distance myself from this for a while, and decide what I'm doing. I like these current forms, but I'm not sure how appropriate they look. I appreciate any comments on this.   \n   \n ![jy3](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121720im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33498.gif)\n\n"
