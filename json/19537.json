  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am a student at Metro State of Denver. This semester has been very unique. I am recently enrolled in a class that is technically running a furniture design company. The business department has teamed up with the design department and we are selling limited [edition] signed furniture pieces. We have come up with a whole new idea this semester when it comes to art and room design. We have come up with a movement called room deco. It is very new and very unique. Basically the idea behind room deco is that an individual builds his or her home around the idea that every piece you put in your home is an actual art piece signed by a specific designer. Really this movement allows the collector to become the artist. If you want to see some of our designs for this class you can go to [www.brandspankinnew.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20100101093603/http:/www.brandspankinnew.org/ \"www.brandspankinnew.org\")\n\n",
