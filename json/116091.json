  "content": "Hi everyone  \nHaving used QuarkXPress for years, I'm still struggling when it comes to transfer my working habits into InDesign — you can't specify H&J parameters outside of a Paragraph Style Sheet, the keybord shortcut for \"thin space\" doesn't involve using the space key at all, etc.  \nQuark also used to allow tweaking the kerning pair table for a specific font, a feature which I've always found very handy (to adjust the space before and after the figure 1 in most classic sans serif typefaces like Univers or Akzidenz Grotesk, for instance). Does anybody know if InDesign includes a similar feature and, if so, where can it be found ?\n\n",
