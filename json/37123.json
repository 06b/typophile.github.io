I know the style is hand done, but it looks off.\n\n2. The left side of the u looks a little weak. Especially at the top. Try giving it a similar weight as the right side.\n\nWith these suggestions don't kill the hand crafted look. It's working!\n\nAlso, the dots on the u are a ü? Just making sure.\n\nRandy\n\n"
