After further research I found out that they did published another catalogue called \"Film Alphabet Compendium Franklin Photolettering\" which contains all the alphabet and number samples. It was in a binder format.\n\nI would be interested to know if anyone is willing to sell their copy to me. Price will be negotiable...\n\n"

      "content": "The Alphabet Thesaurus was published by Photo-Lettering Inc., not Franklin Photolettering Inc. Franklin did do some knockoffs of PhotoLettering's stuff but they were tiny in comparison, size-wise. House Industries is the current owner of the entire Photo-Lettering Inc. collection.\n\nThe Alphabet Thesaurus Volume 2 does contain extended samples of the fonts in the back of the book, about eight or nine point, but none of the samples show complete alphabets. The missing letters are not consistent either but vary from font to font.\n\nIt might be possible to eventually find a copy for sale on eBay. That's how I finally acquired my copy, using eBay's emailed watch list feature. They aren't easy to find.\n\n"
