Top—Pharmacy, below—Roselyn script. I’ll get Ray to update the static online version at Typodermic with this animated one.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907161821im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/postscript_anim2_4536.gif)\n\nPharmacy was an early unicase type, an adaptation of a pharmacy sign Harold found _“at a local (Albany, NY) drugstore. Waiting at the red light, I’d often stared at the sign, admiring its jolly and curious mix of upper and lowercase, and of course the peculiar asymmetrical capital A.”_\n\nPharmacy goes rather nicely with Roselyn : ^ )\n\nWith much gratitude and thanks to Harold, who turned 50 yesterday. Thanks to Ray Larabie for hosting.\n\nj a m e s\n\n [‹ Developing Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907161821/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47021 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [International examples of wood type's heyday? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907161821/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47039 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
