  "content": "Hello all. I hope that someone can help me solve an annoying problem I am having. (Especially Si Daniels. Hi Si.)\n\nWe have a client who has fully licensed one of our fonts, and wishes to embed those fonts in internal Microsoft Word documents. This is allowed under the terms of our EULA.\n\nThis client is having a hard time getting the fonts to embed in Microsoft Word 2002 and 2003, running on Windows XP. The software is probably localised for Norway.\n\nI have generated the fonts in CFF-flavoured and TT-flavoured OpenType, as well as \"traditional\" TrueType without any OT features. The embedding was, of course, turned on when generating.\n\nI have generated the fonts every way 'til Sunday, including using FontLab 45M, FontLab Studio 5W and 5MBeta, and have tried using TransType Pro 3M starting from every conceivable source: VFB, WinTTF, MacTTF, MacPST1, WinPST1...\n\nIn other words, I have jumped through every hoop, to no avail.\n\nIs it possible that embedding in Word is a problem?  \nIs it possible that the client's font cache is now completely full of conflicting fonts?  \nIs it possible that FontLab and TransType are incorrectly saving embedding settings?\n\nAny help would be massively appreciated. Any off-list emails can be sent to chester (at) vllg.com.\n\nThanks a bundle, phellow typophiles. (Can you believe that this is my first ever topic submission?)\n\n",

[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121825/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx\")\n\nAlso check the font in Font Validator to make sure there are no serios errors as they may cause the font to be rejected by the embedding code.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"

Not just the suffix part, but the begining of the word. Yeah, you end up with some silly names...\n\n"

A bit of digging around on the web seemed to indicate a suspicious lack of detailed infomation, particularly on how the different levels of font embedding (print, editable, installable) work in practice. I'm not sure that it really works as described.\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong, though.\n\n"

If the fonts embed fine in PPT but not Word then Word would likely be the culprit.\n\nSi\n\n"

I've never found one for Word.\n\nIf they're for internal distribution as editable docs can't they just all have the fonts purchased and installed company wide? Or if for read-only distribution, use PDFs.\n\nRemember that font embedding will increase the size of documents and is not controllable on a font by font basis - you can easily end up with 1Mb 1 page docs if you embed a few large fonts.\n\n"
