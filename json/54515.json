  "content": "I think so far my favorite font is \"Eurostile\", by Aldo Novarese in 1962. This font stemmed from another one of Novarese's fonts, \"Microgramma\". Although \"Microgramma\" was one of his Most famous font designs, Novarese did not include lowercase letters. \"Eurostile\", on the other hand, added the missing lowercase letters, as well as adopted a variety of weights, such as Compact, and more widths, such as Condensed and Extended.\n\nThe square shape of the letters reflect the modern designs that were growing in popularity in the time of the font's creation. Such designs included TV screens and airplane windows. The linear nature of this font is also said to reflect moden architecture, with an appeal to both technical and functional. Science fiction novels and film artwork have used \"Eurostile\", as well as particularly older model vehicles and company logos. Even the music industry took to this font, as it is found on album covers belonging to U2, Ash, The Supernaturals, and Marilyn Manson.\n\nI like this font because it has a pretty large font family, and many different variations, such as Extended, Extended 2, Candy, Next and others. To a non-designer I suppose it could look like a simple font, but knowing the history behind it, it definitely is not simple. My favorite letters in this font are \"L\" and \"S\". \"L\" is just a general favorite letter of mine because I've written it in so many ways since its the first letter of my name. But, I like the way the \"S\" looks in the Eurostile font. I can't really explain why, but I do.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Eurostile.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629080359/http:/typophile.com/files/Eurostile.pdf) | 712.17 KB |\n\n",
