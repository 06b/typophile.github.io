This font is used on the [LA Kings website (lakings.com)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132703/http:/kings.nhl.com/) and social media ( [facebook](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132703/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.facebook.com/LAKings/photos_stream), [instagram](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132703/http:/instagram.com/lakingshockey), [twitter photos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132703/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Ftwitter.com/LAKings/media)).\n\nThese are some fonts that I found to be similar in some respects, but not the right one: FF DIN, ITC Conduit, Battersea, Stratum 1, Stratum 2, Lintel, Route 66, Geogrotesque, Bourgeois, Rama Gothic, H&J Forza, Purista Web, Moire, Tstar, Helsinki, Nudista, Boxed.\n\nHere are some images from across their social media. I tried to include symbols, numbers, some lowercase, different weights, and certain letters (K, Q, M) that seemed to trip me up with the fonts above:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132703im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LAKINGS_mediafont_6021.jpg)\n\nI would appreciate the help.
