THIS IS A FAVOR TO A FRIEND AND I ONLY HAD ONE DAY TO WORK ON IT. I had numerous versions, but this is the one that we came to agree to like the most.\n\nThis is the front of an invitation, but I have two versions in a pdf file put as a spread just so that you could compare the subtle differences (in placing of the information and typographic details). The theme of the exhibit is Dec14th of 2009 (it will feature the work of both the photographer as well as the fashion designer).\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [final.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416215322/http:/typophile.com/files/final.pdf) | 267.99 KB |\n\n",
