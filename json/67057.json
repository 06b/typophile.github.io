[BPtypewrite](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014035035/http:/www.backpacker.gr/) is in fact BPmono italics standing up, with new soft edges, and a whole system of supporting fonts including underscored, strikethrough and slashed. As all backpacker.gr fonts it supports modern Greek. The italics version remains in all variations, while a rough alternate complements the whole set (BPtypewriteDamaged). So, let the BPtypewriting begin!\n\nBPtypewrite's system is very close to caketype's [Nitti Typewriter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014035035/http:/www.caketype.com/type/nitti_typewriter/index.html) designed by Pieter van Rosmalen. Check it out if you want extended language support, more variations and opentype features.\n\n",
