  "content": "Great forum!   \n   \nWe are selecting fonts for an upcoming novel, St. CROIX.   \n   \nThe book is an historical fiction set in the 18th century. [www.tomahpublishing.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224215/http:/www.tomahpublishing.com/)   \n   \nHave chosen Bickham for the prologue, first letter on new chapters, and historical quotes. We like Bickham especially since he would have been contemporary for the time, and the protagonist has a vast personal library. The author is even including a discussion among characters about Bickham's \"new\" broadsides from Bickham's \"The Universal Penman.\"   \n   \n [www.davidsongalleries.com/artists/bickham/bickham.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224215/http:/www.davidsongalleries.com/artists/bickham/bickham.html)   \n   \nWe are looking now for an appropriate book text font that will work with the Bickham embellishments.   \n   \nThanks,   \nZoe\n\n",

      "content": "Caslon Old Style 337 is a faithful rendering of the original metal face of the same name, which in turn was an early 20th century revival. I believe Mr. Giampa worked directly from the metal type. This is great if you are going to use letterpress printing (a lot of letterpress printers like these because of this), but they will tend to look a little thin in offset printing.   \n   \nAdobe Caslon is a recent (c. 1990) revival of the original 18th century Caslon types done by Carol Twombly at Adobe. It's a very modern purely digital adaptation with a lot of corrections and smoothing out of the design while still capturing the flavor of the original. The overall feel is similar to Caslon Old Style, but without the quirks.   \n   \nFounder's Caslon is an facsimile reproduction by Justin Howe of Caslon's original types, warts and all. The most striking thing about this version is that, instead of doing one design that captures the general look of all the different sizes Caslon cut, there are many different fonts, each based on a particular size of the original Caslon. Using this, you could make a reasonable facsimile of the way metal type used to look, when every size was a separately cut font.   \n   \nOf these three, I would go with either Adobe Caslon or Founder's Caslon, depending on the look you're after. Founder's would be better if you need to use it in display sizes, not just text.   \n   \nAlso, you might look at some of the suggestions we offered in a couple of threads earlier this month, [one is here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224215/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37822.html?1086748247), but I can't seem to find the other one. I'll post a link if I find it.\n\n"
