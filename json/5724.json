Thanks to this thread, Yuri and Adam's names will now be indexed on search engines and show up in Google et al linked to terrorism, Homeland Security, etc.   \n   \nA respected educator and ATypI member was dismayed to discover that his name showed up in an archived ATypI Rome newsletter satire in which he is described as being arrested for the names on Roman statues to Greek. Funny at the time perhaps, but not when he had to explain to prospective students that no, he has not been in trouble with the law in Italy.   \n   \nI suggest that you ask the Typophile guys to remove this thread.\n\n"

Of course, those that _read_ the article after finding it on Google would, presumably, notice that its a satire.   \n   \nIt would have perhaps been wise to check with them first before posting (assuming they did not), but I think I'd like to hear Mr Yarmola and Mr Twardoch opinion on the satire and whether it should be removed?   \n   \nSatire and parody hold an important position in many of our cultures for dissent and commentary, one I would not like to see disappear for fear of stupid people not realising that yellow cake and chocolate frosting is a somewhat unlikely WMD.\n\n"

This did cheer me up, as did the fact that I was fortunately able to give some \"virtual\" talks at Fontlab Ltd.'s workshops at TypeCon, yesterday and today.   \n   \n(I joined in over [WebEx](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125351/http:/www.webex.com/), a commercial online conferencing system that I must say I'm quite impressed with despite a few glitches.)   \n   \nI definitely don't mind the story written by Leslie! But to clarify: I was not denied a visa but was rather victim to excessive bureaucracy that effectively prohibited me from applying for a visa in the first place. I [described it in more detail](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125351/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/33767.html#POST68275) for those interested. Yuri did not even plan to go to TypeCon this time, BTW. But I definitely don't mind Leslie's and Tiffany's poetic license!   \n   \nUnlike my non-existent terrorist links, I do confess that it was me who commited that satire piece about the \"respected educator and ATypI member\" who was arrested for changing the names on Roman statues to Greek. Damn it, it's [still online](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125351/http:/www.atypi.org/30_past_conferences/10_Rome_2002/news_html?newsid=35). Sorry Gerry! :\\> I really hope that the story depicted there is so absurd that nobody would believe it! In particular, prospective type designers who want to study in Reading. BTW -- when I spoke to Gerry, the only thing he complained about was that I referred to him as \"scholar\" ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125351im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)  \n   \nBest,   \nAdam\n\n"
