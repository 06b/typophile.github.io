  "content": "Hi there, I'm currently looking for a geometric sans serif with a design similar to Kabel Light, but, if possible, with some alternate glyphs to give it more personality. I'm inspired by a typeface designed by Ian Party, named Sang Bleu 5, which unfortunately is not for sale:\n\n[http://www.ianparty.com/index.php?id=6](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719014412/http:/www.ianparty.com/index.php?id=6 \"http://www.ianparty.com/index.php?id=6\")\n\nI'm also fascinated by the design of a late 60's British team, Bentley/Farrell/Burnett, and the use they made of (apparently) hand-made variations on the Avant Garde / Kabel lineage:\n\n[http://mikedempsey.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5532538c48833011169029392970c-800wi](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719014412/http:/mikedempsey.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5532538c48833011169029392970c-800wi \"http://mikedempsey.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5532538c48833011169029392970c-800wi\")\n\n[http://mikedempsey.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5532538c48833011169028bb7970c-800wi](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719014412/http:/mikedempsey.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5532538c48833011169028bb7970c-800wi \"http://mikedempsey.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5532538c48833011169028bb7970c-800wi\")\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks!\n\n",
