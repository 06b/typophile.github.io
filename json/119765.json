Note in particular the reverse emphasis in \\_A\\_ which makes it harmonize better with the \\_V\\_ next to it.  \nSimilar idea to Sweet Titling No. 22 [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/titling-no-22/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414160952/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/titling-no-22/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/titling-no-22/\") which has fewer lines.
