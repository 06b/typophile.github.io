So I called Monotype who informed me that they made the font so that it linked to the bold file and all I had to do was hit “cmd+b” to bold it. Basically, a force bold, but with an actual postscript file which it draws from so in effect a double negative, resulting in a true bold drawing from an actual post script.\n\nThe files are postsccript. They are not OTF.\n\nHELP!\n\nDoes someone else make NEWS SANS that has a complete working suitcase? I do have font lab here, though I am a bit of a novice at it, is there a way to seperate the postscript files called ATNewNumFou and ATNewNumFouBol so that when I add them, they are not linked and the Bold actually shows up?\n\n-Andrew\n\n",
