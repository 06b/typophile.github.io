During my scouting, I came across Drawbot, “an ideal tool to teach the basics of programming.” Sounds like me! However, it refuses to work on my machine (10.4.5) and before I spend more time figuring out why, I would like to know if anyone here has found it useful—especially in regards to learning Python for typeface produciton.\n\nCheers!\n\n—K\n\n [‹ Unicode based fonts problems in Photoshop](http://web.archive.org/web/20080531001411/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18065 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font issues in Quark XPress ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080531001411/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18371 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
