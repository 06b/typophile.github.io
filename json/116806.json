My opinion is that it was probably a graphic made by mixing and overlaying letters from various fonts and adding the 'antennas' afterwards.\n\nDoes anyone recognize this as a font?\n\nThanks,  \n- Mike Yanega\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701114729im_/http:/typophile.com/files/spacewhat_4595.gif)\n\n",
