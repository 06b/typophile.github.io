What those converters probably mean is that they _embed_ a BDF into a TT file (something I once did, when making Arasan). But many systems simply ignore those these days...\n\nNow, if your objective is to \"reproduce\" a bitmap font via outlines\\* I have some custom software that does that, but I haven't fired it up in years...
