No graphics (I cheated a tiny bit there), no gradients, only one font family. If anyone cares to provide some feedback (please, be harsh, down to the minutest detail—I’m new, I need to learn), I should be very grateful.\n\n[Link to PDF version](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018071131/http:/qvenon.com/files/opg_6_janus.pdf)\n\n",

Have the “JA” and “NEJ” in the orange/pink colours, as well? That works fairly well, actually. ( [New PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018071131/http:/qvenon.com/files/opg_6_janus_1_v2.pdf))\n\n(I just reduced the palette by one: I had accidentally used two different pinks and only noticed so now.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<cite>use pantone and develop a good looking pallett.</cite>\n\nSo here come the stupid questions: how exactly do I do that? I have only a general idea of how the whole Pantone system works, and I have no Pantone ‘reference guides’ (or whatever they might even be called).\n\nThis is a Design 1 class, remember. :-)\n\n"

      "content": "You should have access to Pantone books somwhere at your uni/learning institution. Not only does this make it easier to choose colours which work well together, but specifying pantone colours also means you are more likely to have the printed and finished product come out with the colours you intended. You need to use the right guide for the media you are printing on (coated or uncoated stock).\n\nI think it looks really good - and even though there are less colours in the second pdf you posted, I actually preferred the first one; something about the green NER which doesn't come through with it in pink. I think perhaps it is that the DEMO, in the second poster, becomes the only one of the large words to have its own colour - it already stands out much more by being white and being larger than the rest. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it may be useful for what the poster is communicating (unfortunately I don't understand it).\n\nI definitely like it though\n\n-Rafe\n\n"

      "content": "Rafe said it with the pantone stuff. It is good to take a look at all the color possibilities you have. The second one is the only option obviously, it's stunning. As far as which two colours, that's really your decision. I would definitely find a pantone book if you can. Because it is beginning the teacher most likely wont mark you down for having more colors, but he will probably enjoy you going for less just because it is much cheaper and more efficient in the printing world. to make it three colour (say a blue yellow and green) with key(black) would actually reduce it by two colours as long as you have the yellow and blue mixing to make a green. You obviously seem very interested in this so ask your teacher for a few pointers in regards to what we talked about.\n\n"
