The proposal lists specific mappings of font-variant-xxx properties/values to OpenType/AAT features but I don't expect to get this right the first time, I'm sure it will take a few iterations to hone. I'm especially interested in hearing about features omitted or overlooked that folks feel are actually valuable to support.\n\nAny comments/thoughts/ideas would be most helpful, posted here or on the www-style mailing list.\n\nJohn Daggett  \nMozilla Japan\n\n",
