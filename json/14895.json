  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m just wondering : on Typophile, when will the Projects and the Ressources sections be available ? Before the launch of this new version, there was some very interesting content in these sections.\n\n- Bitmap fonts grid, etc.  \n- The project of the “traveling book” where you had to create a page and then send the book to someone else (hey, I was on the list of people wishing to receive it ! i’m stil VERY interested !)  \n- etc.\n\nDoes anyone have more info on when these will be online ?\n\nThanks so much,\n\n [‹ Just for fun...](http://web.archive.org/web/20071012143922/http:/typophile.com/node/19300 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Career change into graphic design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071012143922/http:/typophile.com/node/19332 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Typophile is a great resource and the fact that it exists is reason enough to thank the people behind it...often and with sincerity. But they, like most of us, have day jobs and most likely devote their “spare” time to keeping Typophile up and running. I look forward to future updates to the site, but will allow it to happen when it can.\n\nThat said, I am very interested in the status of the travelling book project. Who currently has one? Is anyone interested in setting up a tracking system for the books?\n\n"

I joined around the time of the switch to this new version (about a year ago) and it was all full of exciting new features and what-nots then it sorta petered out. I didn’t know it was a side project worked on during the few free wee hours of ultra busy designers. Please accept my humble apologies... I do enjoy Typophile so.\n\n"
