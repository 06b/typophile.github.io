Whether you love it or hate it, I need the alternative characters for it!\n\nSpecifically the slanted versions of characters like the 'A' and 'W' etc.\n\nI have a selection of the normal type weights just not the alternative characters.\n\nIf anyone can shed some light on how to find them, I would really appreciate it!\n\nThanks\n\n",
