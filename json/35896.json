  "content": "hi everybody,\n\ni have a client that is asking that i create a logo using the same font as the \"roberto cavalli\" logo. i am doing my own research now (and did a search on here to see if this already came up), but i know we have some real geniuses on this board, so i would appreciate any help or tips!\n\nthanks in advance, you guys are the best!\n\nsincerely,  \nc\n\np.s. i imagine it is most likely a custom-drawn logo, but it is probably based on an existing font, right? or how could i approximate it as best as possible? that cool lower-case narrow, rounded r, for example,or the e, with the diagonal bar. i am looking through compressed, gothic fonts, maybe with a slight art-deco styling to them?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320223108im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cavalli_logo_5958.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "hey thanks sihep this is excellent!!!\n\ni think this is very very close, at least for my purposes.\n\ni guess the biggest difference that i can see is just the rounded/smooth corners of the original logo, that organic quality it has.\n\n(what is that called btw? when the edges and corners are soft and worn in, like old, real type, vs. the hard geometric edges of vector-drawn fonts -- like that organic font used a lot now in new york magazine)\n\nalso, the \"t\" is a bit different, the terminal and the crossbar, and the cavalli logo is more oval/oblong, whereas this one is taller and sharper, but it is FANTASTIC!\n\ni can also work with the ascenders and make the shorter, and that will help the x-height look more similar.\n\nand you know what, i actually like that thin version much better than the real logo!\n\nand, just to show you how great it is, let me show you where i was -- i was way back with bodega sans light! yikes!\n\nthanks again!!!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320223108im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cavalli_bodega_5748.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Unfortunately it’s compressed and what you’re after is condensed. Glad that was helpful, though. There’s also Dax Condensed Medium from FontShop with a similar ‘r’ and ‘e’ but it doesn’t have the same retro look.\n\n\"i guess the biggest difference that i can see is just the rounded/smooth corners of the original logo, that organic quality it has\".\n\nHad a quick look at [www.robertocavalli.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320223108/http:/www.robertocavalli.com/ \"www.robertocavalli.com\") and think the type has hard geometric edges – those might just be pixels.\n\n\"what is that called btw? when the edges and corners are soft and worn in, like old, real type, vs. the hard geometric edges of vector-drawn fonts — like that organic font used a lot now in new york magazine)\"\n\nDon’t know, unfortunately.

You should post the question and get a proper answer from someone who designs typefaces.\n\nBest wishes\n\n"
