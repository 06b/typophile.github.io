Furthermore, have a look at the [FAQ Free](http://web.archive.org/web/20090511044240/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FAQ%252BFree).\n\nMicrosoft Windows comes with a handsome sans-serif font family by [Joshua Darden](http://web.archive.org/web/20090511044240/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Joshua%252BDarden), the designer of Freight. [Corbel](http://web.archive.org/web/20090511044240/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Corbel) has four weights, very wide language support (including Cyrillic and Greek), small-caps, various figure styles and more. Note that Corbel is [not a free font](http://web.archive.org/web/20090511044240/http:/typophile.com/node/38272).\n\nBTW, here’s a link to [Freight Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20090511044240/http:/www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_sans).  \nF\n\n"
