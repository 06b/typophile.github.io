  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a music artist/DJ (electronic dance music) and I'm trying to create a unique type-based logo to be used on flyers/website/album covers etc. I only started learning Illustrator a few weeks ago so I'm pretty much a rookie. This is one idea I managed to come up with:\n\n[http://typophile.com/files/phynnlogo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021185931/http:/typophile.com/files/phynnlogo.gif \"http://typophile.com/files/phynnlogo.gif\")\n\nAs you can see it's quite plain, and doesn't really stand out in terms of originality from other logos in the dance music business.\n\nAny tips or ideas from more advanced designers would be a great help!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [phynnlogo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021185931/http:/typophile.com/files/phynnlogo.gif) | 3.86 KB |\n\n",
