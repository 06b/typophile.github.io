  "content": "It's music festival time, and festivals mean lots of ads in the papers. In my native country, Norway, these music festival ads have been dominated by an overuse of Rosewood Fill the last few years. Looking at a paper with five or six ads for various festivals, one could get the impression that they were all made by the same designer, but I doubt that is the case. Is this a trend, laziness, everyone trying to copy other people's designs or what? And what is the situation like in other countries whereas music related ads is concerned? Is there more variety?\n\nFrankly I'm getting fed up with Rosewood Fill. It's a shame. The typeface is rather sweet.\n\n",

MANY of the ads were all designed in-house. Many of the local weeklies still appear to do a lot of in-house ad design. You can certainly tell their 3 favorite fonts as they show up in about half the ads. ;o)\n\n"

The spacing and kerning for Rosewood was done to make the ornamented version look right. When Adobe released the Chromatic Woodtypes, they thought that probably someone would try to use one of the fill fonts alone, but that they would see how bad the proportions, weights and spacing looked without the ornamented layer, and use something else.\n\nYou never know what will be done with a typeface once it's released.\n\n"
