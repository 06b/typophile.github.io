Ideally, each letter or [grapheme](http://web.archive.org/web/20150410014618/http:/typophile.com/wiki/grapheme) corresponds to a specific sound or [phoneme](http://web.archive.org/web/20150410014618/http:/typophile.com/wiki/phoneme); this is not always the case. Each language typically has its own alphabet that is tailored to its specific needs in terms of representation of the language in written form.\n\nSee also [Alphabets](http://web.archive.org/web/20150410014618/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Alphabets).\n\n",
