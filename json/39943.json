      "content": "“Nacho” is a contraction, both for the name Ignacio, and also sometimes used in software/signal piracy for things that are “not yours” (e.g., a “nacho chip” in your cable tuner would give you access to channels that are “nachos”, i.e., not yours). This site is about sharing images found on the web, so, as a user of the site you would be submitting photos that are not yours, hence the name “nachophoto”.\n\nI’ve never heard of it before, but I figure that’s how they came up with the name. Since it does at least link back to the sources of the images, it may be no more infringing than Google Image Search.\n\nOf course, since you found a photo there that is yours, this explanation might not make as much sense.\n\n"
