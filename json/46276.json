  "content": "Hi Typos,  \nI think of investing in a humanist sanserif font which I would use as a companion for Minion Pro (among other things), mainly for publications about linguistics. Apart from basic and extended Latin character set I also need Cyrillic and Greek, which limits the possibilities substantially. I am a big fan of [Scala Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20120128095806/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=13665) (I know, it would be just imitating Bringhurst, but it really is a great font). Scala Sans doesn't include neither Cyrillic nor Greek, however.  \nRight now my favourite choice is [Kievit Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20120128095806/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=10110) (I wouldn't know whether to pick [Regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20120128095806/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=10994) or [Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20120128095806/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=11011) as my point of departure, though).  \nAnother option is [Stormtype Anselm Sans Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20120128095806/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-84-anselm-sans-pro).  \nBringhurst recommends Syntax with Minion - but as far as I can see, the Cyrillic version of Syntax, [Paratype Humanist 531](http://web.archive.org/web/20120128095806/http:/www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Humanist-531.htm), does not include an italic, which is crucial to my needs. And I don't know if there is a Greek version.  \nSuggestions are welcome!  \nCheers,  \nThomas\n\n",

[Myriad](http://web.archive.org/web/20120128095806/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=myriad) is the obvious cmpanion and not necessarily the best, but it does include Greek and Cyrillic.\n\n"

It's a pity there aren't any small caps, though - it's not that I _have_ to have small caps, it's just nice to have the possibility.  \nJessi, I wasn't able to find a Greek version of URW Grotesk. Where did you see that? It's really a very nice typeface. Do you think it goes well with Minion?  \nJames, thanks for drawing my attention to FF Meta. Like Kievit, Meta even seems to have Greek and Cyrillic small caps. But again, how would Meta go with Minion?  \n(I see that Syntax isn't as popular as it used to be, but I incidentally noticed that Linotype Syntax Com includes both Cyrillic and Greek versions, with italics.)  \nThanks a lot for your input!  \nCheers,  \nThomas\n\n"

For my questions, I wrote a new thread in the general discussions forum.\n\nI am questioning because I have heard the name Akzidenz Grotesk a lot more that URW Grotesk, but same there, you don't have the Greek.

I think I'll end up with Kievit, although in my opinion it's a little too neutral.  \nThanks again for your help.  \nThomas\n\n"

I am wholly dependent on Minion, but for the record it is good to notice that the Fedra family covers both Cyrillic and Greek.  \nBy the way, I noticed that in [the Russian translation of _Elements_](http://web.archive.org/web/20120128095806/http:/www.aronov-books.ru/typo_1.html), Bringhurst uses Charter and Humanist 531 (Paratypes's version of Syntax).
