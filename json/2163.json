The number of you on this forum who are able and care to hunt   \nup such an animal can probably be counted on one hand.   \n   \nThe number of active, non-lurking participants in this forum are relatively   \nfew already. Therefore, in my humble opinion, would it not, perhaps, be   \nbetter to involve more participants by offering more accessible fonts/glyphs   \nin the quiz?   \n   \nThe answer could still be made tricky with choice of letter/number, size of   \nsample image, crafty clues, etc. And if somebody guesses it the same day?   \nFine.

In the words of Fred Durst, I'm in agreeance with the vast majority of views expressed above that some of the individual quizzes were a tad too obscure (though not Grant's last one -- that was just inability on all of our parts). I'm sort of against splitting into two quiz areas, however -- though I am happy to see some new faces responding here, I think a better solution would be to require a quiz poster to put up a sample that can be found digitally. That doesn't mean it can't be obscure, just that everyone has an equal chance of finding it online. I like Daniel's suggestion of a sped-up process of adding new hints or showing more of the glyph.   \n   \nFor the folks who have classic old specimens they were culling from to stump the hell out of us, maybe someone can start a thread called \"Typefaces that were never digitized but should be.\"   \n   \nAnd to Grant: uh...   \n   \nAnd to Grant and Randy (and anyone else who, like me, is sitting in front of their computer on a Saturday night): something is seriously wrong with us.
