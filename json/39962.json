Must check the settings then..\n\nThe image you see is jsut a part of a pdf file and when it was given to me I thought: “Gooooood,  \nsome vectors!!”.  \nJust to discover that no, that wasn’t the case. It was just a pdf with a jpeg in it... :-|\n\nI do not think that it was completely done by hand, but I will double-check on that.\n\nTrouble is that this word is part of the Bar’s name that has to be vectorised to be scaled  \nand printed - by your truly own - on the canopy outside the bar...\n\nIt looks like there’s some work for Inkscape here....\n\nBack to work now...\n\nAnd no, Nick, I don’t like it. My fave right now seems to be Dirty Headline\n\nmove your feet  \nto the smoking beat\n\n"
