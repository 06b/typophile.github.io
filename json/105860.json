  "content": "Hi typophiles,\n\nI am re-designing an old font of mine. And I need your help at this point!  \nIndeed, I've been re-thinking the letterspacings and all seems to me in a mess now…!  \nThe typeface is a display one, only for fun : mixing pixel 80's-style and Textura Blackletter, a weird thing! :)  \nIn the first version of the letterspacings, I made it to be legible but now, I find it interesting to use it more in a tight letterspacing, in a way to be more alike with a revival of the historic calligraphic form. But of course, it is less legible, if it's not to say almost \"not-legible\", like the old Bibles though…  \nWant do you think of it? Do you have any advice?  \nThank you in advance for your return!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Test_4020.jpg)\n\nExemple of the historic design:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mainz_187_detail_sm_6358.jpg)\n\n",
