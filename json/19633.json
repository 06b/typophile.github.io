      "content": "It really depends on your design. I think you are quicker if you pull over all glyphs of similar rightside/leftside forms into self-defined classes than starting with a existing classes and then figuring out which glyphs are placed wrongly, or are missing, or are placed in two classes (strictly forbidden) ...  \nBut don’t forget to make separate classes for leftside and rightside forms, and do not place a glyph in two leftside (or rightside) classes if you want to avoid error messages upon compiling the kern feature.\n\nThere was an older thread on class kerning (of January or so) which I cannot find. Also see [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907165712/http:/typophile.com/node/18452).\n\n"

You can also open other OT fonts and look at what they have done in terms of classes.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n"

The application will analyze the shapes of your letters and put those that have similar left and right sides into one class. You can decide if glyphs with different metrics should be combined or not.\n\nA.\n\n"
