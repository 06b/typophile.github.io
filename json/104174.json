  "content": "Cross-posting this message from the OpenType / MPEG Open Font Format lists.\n\n> Dear OpenType /MPEG OFF List members,\n> \n> Today at the Microsoft //build conference in San Francisco, Dan McLachlan of our Graphics team will talk about Windows 8.1 approach to color fonts. We'd like to thank P22, Monotype, The Font Bureau and FontFont for providing us with font data that we were able to use to test this approach.\n> \n> Our implementation uses a base glyph for reference, which would be used for non-color situations. A data structure, implemented as a new 'COLR' table in OpenType, breaks down the base glyph into a separate set of glyphs, each with its own z-order and single color reference. The color references are handled has palette indices, with a separate table, 'CPAL' in OpenType that resolves the RGBA colors actually used for the glyph.\n> \n> We plan to submit documentation on this approach for standardization through the ISO MPEG process (for inclusion in the Open Font Format) within the next few weeks. However, if you'd like to see the approach in practice you can download the Windows 8.1 Preview and see a color font (Segoe UI Emoji) used on the touch enabled keyboard.\n> \n> I'll also be giving a talk at TypeCon on this, hope to see some of you there.\n> \n> Thanks, Michelle\n\nA video of the session should be posted here at some point...

The 'base glyph' is the single-colour representation of the character (in this case U+1F630), and the three COLR table glyphs are mapped from it. Note that each COLR table glyph shares the advance width of the base glyph, and the outlines are arranged so as to appear in the correct positions when the widths are overlayed (presumably a DirectX layout engine operation).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424020938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/u1F630_3783.png)\n  \nEach of the COLR table glyphs would be assigned a colour reference, mapped to an RGBA value in the CPAL table (I presume this is simply an efficiency, rather than storing the RGBA values directly in the COLR table).\n\nIt's an admirably simple system, at least on the font side.

      "content": "_I know but where's the w gonna come from in this emoji._\n\nIn this particular emoji, the only 'white' is the background, which is just the same as for any other glyph. If one were designing a colour font which involved white counters, one would have a couple of different options, depending whether you wanted the counter to be the background colour or explicitly white. For the first, you would need to design the COLR glyphs with knock-through counters. For the second you would create counter outlines as separater COLR glyphs and assign a white colour to them (I'm guessing this is what happens for, e.g. the teeth in grinning face emoji, since you want the teeth to be white regardless of the background colour).\n\nIf you're using the knock-through approach to have background colour counters, then of course things may look crap if the glyph is displayed on an inappropriately coloured background, but that's true of regular fonts too.\n\n_So don't we have a MUST for legible b/w from color?_\n\nThe legible b/w is the base glyph. I'm guessing that there be accessibility options to disable colour font display for people with colour-blindness.\n\nThis colour font scheme, as I understand, does not allow for user preference in the selection of colours. It's an explicit colour model in which the colour is determined by the font maker, not by the user. That said, the COLR table structure would seem to permit the possibility of CPAL overrides if that were something software makers saw a value in supporting. So, for instance, the COLR table might split representation of a character into three glyphs, assigned colour references of 1, 2 and 3. Those colour references would normally be mapped to specific colours in the CPAL table, but it seems to me that a piece of software could interrupt at that stage and allow the user to specify colour mappings for those references that differ from what the font maker intended. I don't know how likely that is in terms of anyone bothering to do it, but it would seem to be possible.\n\n"

And then the colors appear as RGB in your output file. Conversion to CMYK should not be a problem in most workflows, but you might want custom spot colors. Perhaps one would want an option to get the 'exploded' emoji -- all separate parts, to be colored individually.\n\nNevertheless: from a technical point of view, this solution is superior to the ugly scaling bitmaps we've seen so far. Except now the target audience (the Instant Messaging Generation) is going to ask for \"eye candy\" such as gradients, transparency, animation ... sounds ... 😭 (animated and with \"boo-hoo\" sound clip).\n\n"

They are hard to use, especially with multiple size masters, but we and 1,000s of others, have made them for print. So maybe I misunderstand your point.\n\nWhat is true though, is that none of the proposals have room for user choice beyond which font or which glyph. Right? So it's hard not to agree that the web is where this is going to happen for either print or online use. As long as the format can store the separated stack, we can offer a simple interface, they can edit the colors. 3 steps instead of 2.\n\nWithout \"user choice\", I'm thinking of an app that automatically pops a menu, if there's an all white cpal. ;)\n\n"

An organization having a green or blue in their identity could thereby tint all water in Maki to match.\n\nImplementation in CSS for colour webfonts can be quite easily imagined. For example, to change the background colour of all the emoji faces (which use, say, palette index 3) from yellow to pink across all emoji faces you might do something like:\n\n`font-feature-settings: \"palette\" 3 #ffcccc;`\n\n- Laurence\n\n"

      "content": "I haven’t seen any documentation of the tables but the contents are mostly straightforward:\n\nThe COLR table describes the layers that replace the uncoloured version of a glyph. Three longs hold the number of glyphs, the offset to the glyph array and the offset to the layer array. Then there’s a short holding the number of entries in the layers array.\n\nThe glyph array comprises three shorts, the GID to replace, the index into the layer array and the number of layers in this glyph (consecutive entries in the layers array).\n\nThe layers array comprises two shorts, the GID representing that layer component glyph and the colour palette index.\n\nThe CPAL table holds the colour palette and is slightly more mysterious. The header comprises a long (0x2c), a short (2 – number of shorts per entry or colour format?) and a short which is the number of entries in the palette. Then there’s a long of the offset to the palette array, then that 0x2c long again.\n\nThe palette array (for this format?) comprises four bytes – R, G, B, A where A=255 means solid.\n\nSo it’s all pretty trivial. Layering must occur after any GSUB substitutions, obviously, not that they’re likely. Other colour formats may be possible (CMYK, Lab etc) but there’s no reason why software can’t decompose the layers and apply whatever colours it likes to the layer glyphs.\n\nA note on efficiency: The Segoe UI Emoji font in Windows 8.1 could be more tightly defined – the repetitions in the palette indicate a lack of automation but more wastefully there are many cases where whole glyphs are repeated – a colour layer being identical to the monochrome original for example, or layer elements being repeated from glyph to glyph.\n\nAs can be seen, the COLR table itself doesn’t place any such restrictions on the arrangement or ordering of the glyphs themselves. There’s also some slight inconsistency regarding overprint, or overlap. Some layers overlap quite happily if composed in the correct order, others are designed with knockouts and could be composed in any order. Odd.\n\nI’m not sure the alpha is much use beyond shadows, as any colour effects could have been decomposed and as I said before, I’d have liked to have seen optional interpolation between layers to achieve some degree of smooth shading, but it may be that a more complex format of CPAL would allow gradients to be defined, which may be enough.\n\nMicrosoft’s current love affair with flat slabs of colour will not last forever.\n\n"
