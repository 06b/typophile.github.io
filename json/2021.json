Also on the marketing side, what is the target group are you selling to and what is the price point of the product? Where are you going to sell it, Europe, USA elsewhere? Will you have more than one language on the label? Answering these questions could narrow your font search quite a bit. Dan\n\n"

As for target group, I'm not quiet sure, but i guess since it's extra virgin oil that price is a bit higher.   \nJudging from the design of the bottle (\"fancy\" slim design) and the quality of oil, I would say it's for the people who are after great quality product.\n\n"

But let me ask this question: does the Croatian upper-middle-class value Western ideals, or is it nostalgic for the old days, or what?   \n   \nBTW, Optima is very unlikely to be a good choice.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Now the oil will be labeled a Croatia product but do they actually produce to olives there or somewhere else. You could use a term on the bottle like \"Only the finest quality olives from the (blank) region of (country) were used in this first pressed oil.\" Do you have the company name yet and do they have a logo? A typeface that complimented but was different from the logo would be good. Is this a start up product or do they sell other products and this will be added to the line? I have so many question and so few answers. I'm a marketing based designer. I need alot of info to make smart design decisions.\n\n"

In either case I'd get competitive samples so you can make yours stand out. Also consider processes other than printing on a white label. Foil stamp or print on foil. Clear label to show the product and of course die cutting. These are all ways to make your product unique. You might reference the wine industry who does a good job in labeling.\n\n"
