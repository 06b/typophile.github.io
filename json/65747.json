The most similar digital font I found was [Waldstein](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202092426/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=Waldstein&x=17&y=4&sample_text=NOTICIARIO%20ESPANOL) from Fountain. It does not have the top serif on the A, but few fonts do. I tried to match as many letters as I could, and I think the A is the only one that would need much modification.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
