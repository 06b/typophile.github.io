I understand that this typeface is not currently available in digitized form. I am aware of two web sites with complete and partial character set appearing in low quality images, but prefer to see the complete character set of this typeface in print. Thanks.  \n Ray\n\n",

Do you know if this is the Image Club Graphics version? As Justin comments, that version (and your image) is a thicker rendering (not as hairline) than what I have on the stationery.  \n Also, by chance do either of you or anyone know the typeface used on the Typophile site for topic headings such as for this thread? Thanks again.  \n Ray\n\n"

Someone from this forum provided to me privately a 220k  \ntif file that displays the characters with many, but not all, of the alternates. It has all of the characters I am interested in. My original stationery from the early 1970's has twenty characters, most with the uppercase size about 3/4\" high. What I don't have is any digital version. I suspect the version you have, Miss Tiffany, is that done by Image Club Graphics, which I understand is thicker than the original. Still it would be of interest to me.  \n Ray\n\n"
