  "content": "I've recently been approached by somebody who does not want a custom font but custom lettered titles. I have no idea how many titles or how long the titles wil be.   \n   \nThe font doesn't exist, and I'm not sure if they have a specific lettering style in mind so it's totally from scratch.   \n   \nThey want a quote and I'm not sure how to quote this. Initially I was thinking per letter but duplicates would cost 1/2 as much since I've already created them.   \n   \nSo, the word - \"Wood\" would be 3 letters and 1 1/2 price letter.   \n   \nI'm not sure if $50 per letter is reasonable, $25? I'm just fishing more than anything. Any suggestions?   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n",

      "content": "1. You should have a base \"minimum overhead\" amount, and add per-letter amounts to that.   \n2. In lettering various \"glyphs\" of a letter don't have to be the same, and often making them different is the point; so keep it simple and charge per letter.   \n   \nBut the above is assuming they can't just tell you the total amount of work in advance. Why would this be the case?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
