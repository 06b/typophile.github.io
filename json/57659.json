It evokes 1960s TV and pop culture while still having a  \ncontemporary feel. The fun exuberant flavor of this face is perfect for  \nparties and celebrations. The letters dance across the baseline and the  \nlower case wants to be an upper case but just canâ€™t quite make it. P22  \nFestiva Regular includes a full unicode European Character set (Western,  \nCE, Turkish, Romanian etc).\n\nIntroductory offer through May.\n\n[http://p22.com/ihof/festiva.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103131757/http:/p22.com/ihof/festiva.html \"http://p22.com/ihof/festiva.html\")\n\n",
