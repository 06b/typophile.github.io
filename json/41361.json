There is a huge x-ht, generous counters and spacing. . . If I did anything to improve it for this purpose, I'd add long(er) descenders and perhaps an additional g, for when more leading was desired than these short descenders can 'take up', and for better recognition, respectively.\n\nOr show me/us what you mean, because I think your 'certain amount of tension' is the kind of body text Interstate is famous for in 40 styles. :)\n\nCheers!\n\n"
