The font design is really cool.  \n(By the way, I messed up the poster to cobble together more letterform examples.  \nThe un-altered poster looks really nice, and can be seen here:  \n [http://yesisthenewno.warnerbros.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141203200148/http:/yesisthenewno.warnerbros.com/ \"http://yesisthenewno.warnerbros.com/\"))\n\n"

They are made out of some heavy-duty material called Corian that looks like marble. I'd love to have one of those letters.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"
