If you do that with a heavy weight of [ITC Century](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828111044/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-century/) (or adding stroke thickness might be even better), and use the Italic for the rest of the letters I think it’s very similar. Century has the flat top serifs you need.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

That was my first approximation. There is undoubtedly a better font to match the posted sample, but I doubt it was made from a font right ’out of the box’. I think some manipulations were used.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
