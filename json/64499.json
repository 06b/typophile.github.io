  "content": "Hi, I'm in the process of designing a look for our rebranded marketing company. I'm a motion designer, and by no means am I type savvy (I tend to lean on go-to typefaces way too often). We are currently using Alte Haas Groteske Bold (usually all lowercase as the characters are much more interesting) for the majority of our work, its a modified Helvetica, with rounded corners and lots of little imperfections that make it very nice when used in large type sizes, but it loses all of its character and gets really boring when its small. We want to find a nice typeface to could be used to complement it in all of our branded pieces. Any ideas? Take a peek at a temporary page I've put up with some of our branding (although it's quite rushed and not the nicest design) [http://www.mk3creative.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094855/http:/www.mk3creative.com/ \"http://www.mk3creative.com\")\n\nHELP ME!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [mediumwelldone.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094855/http:/typophile.com/files/mediumwelldone.jpg) | 43.14 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "First thing I would do is replace Alte Haas Grotesk. Sure it's free, but this is important enough to spend a little bit of money on. Something with soft corners does seem to be in order, but certainly not something slapped together, and preferably not something derived from such a generic original. I think it would also be useful to choose something narrow, since the name is long. What about one of these?  \n [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/notes-soft/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094855/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/notes-soft/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/notes-soft/\")  \n [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094855/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/\")  \n [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typonine/tempera-rose/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094855/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/typonine/tempera-rose/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typonine/tempera-rose/\")\n\nBTW, the fork is a bit organic, clashing with the rest. I'd either make it rigid, or much more organic - like a melted caricature of a fork. If you make it rigid, you might leverage the fact that both \"m\" and \"w\" actually look like the business end of a fork...\n\nhhp\n\n"
