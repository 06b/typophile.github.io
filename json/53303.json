      "content": "Interesting, challenging project. The curved terminals have charm but are a tough fit as you acknowledge. Maybe if the strokes weren't so insistently monoline (introducing a slight consistent contrast, or thinning bowl strokes as they intersect more dramatically), the thinning flourishes would be a better fit.\n\nAre the flourishes on the figures much more pronounced on purpose? That 9 seems unbalanced, and also may be violating the open apertures you talked about on your website.\n\nI'd make the ear of the g more old-fashioned, curved and \"flourished.\"\n\n"
