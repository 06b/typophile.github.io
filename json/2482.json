I went through the Serif and Slab Serif collections in the Font Book, and nothing had this symbol, so I am presuming that this is something newer than 1998 when that book was published.   \n   \nAny ideas?   \n   \nThanks,   \n- Mike ![Lori & Jim type](http://web.archive.org/web/20051127083107im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22714.gif)\n\n",
