  "content": "I think I prefer the italic. It works a tiny bit better. In both the italic and the Roman the 'h' keeps jumping out at me (same as in the nasty 'Dwiggins Uncial thing'). He could have used a 'h' with an ascender. Not many words in English with 'h' and 'l' next to each other. It wouldn't have messed up his plans too much.   \nThe 'f' and the 'g' are wonderful.   \nIn terms of readability, though, I don't know. But then I'm not a very logical person and I don't like tomatoes.   \n   \nM.\n\n",

      "content": "Hrant: _Making the connection from wooden figurines to subvisible type is all about intuition._   \n   \nOkay, we have different definitions of intuition. In the case of the M-formula, I see a purely logical path, based on observation and experience, from the marionette to the typeface, as explained by Dwiggins in his own words. If this connection had been made by someone with only a passing knowledge of either marionette or type making, then I'd ascribe it to intuition. In the case of someone like Dwiggins, who was intimately and daily involved in the making of both marionettes and type, the connection might even seem to be an obvious one. Perhaps the lesson in this is that type designers benefit from having other hobbies.   \n   \nRe. Dwiggins uncial: one of its bastard children has to be 'FF Disturbance', even though I'm pretty sure that Jeremy Tankard had never seen Dwiggin's original when he designed Disturbance.\n\n"

      "content": "The M-formula as laid out in the document of July 3, 1937, is a typically engaging expression of WAD's ideas along these lines; but it was not a sudden epiphany on Dwiggins part. Neither was it formulated specifically in relation to newspaper designs, as one might infer from Unger's article. I have evidence of at least two earlier documents outlining some of the same ideas -- although neither of these specifically mentions marionettes. One of these, in fact, from February of the same year, is essentially a proto-M-formula. I haven't tracked down the drawings to see whether he put these ideas into practice before the July document. The application of the theory to small, newspaper types came about a year later.   \n   \nMy point is that the M-formula is a culmination of thinking that WAD had been doing in this direction for about two years.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

I think the most serious attack we can make on him in relation to the above experiment concerns the serious anachronism inherent in his perception of the Irish-English/semi-uncial as an essentially 'English' letter. I'm wondering what the level of scholarship was like on that sort of thing in the 1940s? What sources might he have been using?   \n   \nIn the 8th and 9th centuries the 'English' he's talking about didn't exist yet. Letter frequency statistic are completely different for Old English and Modern English, so his theory about the suitability of semi-uncial is way off. On top of that, the letter forms he's talking about were developed for use in Latin texts and not English (or even Irish).   \n   \nBut I love it anyway. To hell with logic.   \n   \nMatha.\n\n"
