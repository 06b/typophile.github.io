  "content": "I am looking for typesetters who are proficient with FrameMaker for a very IMMEDIATE project here in southern CA. It’s freelance work — starting literally TODAY and going for about 7-10 days or so. Schedule can be worked out, but we need immediate typesetting to get a deadline met. Can you help on this? Do you know someone who can? Call me at (323) 595-6242 or (323) 462-2140. Thanks.

Maybe you could provide a lot more details about the project and some of the friendly people here might know of someone to help you out.\n\nWould people have to go to SoCal or could you discuss with them over the phone and send them the files they need via email or download?\n\nWhat kind of work are you looking for? What kind of books/typsetting do you need done? Do you only need 1 typesetter, or are their multiple books/projects you need worked on?\n\nWhat is your budget for this project?\n\n"

We have pretty great facilities and literally just lack the manpower. It’s several books, and we’re looking for several typesetters.\n\nThe main issue we’ve got is that the work must be done FAST. I’d literally like to get some typesetters to work TODAY and this would go for the next 7-10 days or so.\n\nBoth schedule and budget questions are really for my boss. But if someone gives me a call (323) 595-6842 or (323) 462-2140, I’ll give you contact info for him and he can REALLY answer any and all questions.\n\n"
