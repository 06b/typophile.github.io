      "content": "First, I like any monogram without delicate swirls, and this has some great potential.\n\nIt feels unbalanced to me. The breaks aren't visually equal, and the bottom bowl is kicked out too far? I agree with Lex; the curves seem inexplicably chopped off. I say let the curves be full curves or make the \"chop off\" more dramatic.\n\n"
