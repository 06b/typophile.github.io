      "content": "Please help!   \n   \nI am looking for a font/typeface that is close to a combination of the Frigidaire and/or Cadillac/Chevrolet, and Eureka, (a hearse manufacturer). It is a script type font sort of art-deco, what would have been considered futuristic looking in the 40-50's.   \n   \nI have no money to spend on it at this time and need a free public domain font, that can be tweaked a little. (I also could use some recomendations on software that does that.)   \nSomeday I hope to start a hearse manufacturing concern,(a small one)and want the typeface to look a certain way, (I can see it in my mind's eye) I am sure you all get the general idea!   \n   \nWell that's about it.   \nShould someone have a font/typeface like this please contact me at. [joeyp@anet-dfw.com](mailto:joeyp@anet-dfw.com).   \n   \nThank you in advance for any help you can send my way!   \n   \nJoey\n\n"
