(that's kinda scary)   \nFirst on our list is to rework the mast head, the current one is pretty atrocious, i'll post it for you.   \n ![Current masthead](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25543.jpg)  \nSo my publisher wanted me to come up with several designs that we'll let our readers choose from to be the final nameplate. I was looking through old editions and found that the paper's header kept going back and forth between different blackletter designs and a more simple, serif design, lemme show you what i mean... ![Header from 1913](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25544.gif)   \n ![Nameplate from 1930](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25545.gif)   \nI really like this blackletter and am thinking of cleaning it up for one of my designs, another blackletter face i'd like to see head our paper is Agincourt ( [http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=agincourt](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=agincourt)) , but i'm worried that that may be a bit too fussy, but i'm a sucker for blackletter, so i need a more balanced opinion. For some other designs i need a face that's classy, simple, clean, but still has some personality. Any suggestions are welcome.   \nEvenutally i'm hoping we'll change our body type and the type for headers and would appreciate any suggestions there as well. I took a look at fontbureau's fonts for newspapers last nite and none of them really grabbed me and that's about as far as i've researched thus far. Anyhow, thanks for your interest and any suggestions/feedback.\n\n"

Should it look like a small town paper? Do readers want it to look like a small town paper?   \n   \nThe implications of this are many. For example, the NYT doesn't have any advertising on the font cover. Should that be a priority? Even if there must be ads on the front page, I would lobby hard to remove them from the masthead.   \n   \nOn the masthead: You are dealing with people who are comfortable with 3D photoshopped type, a waving american flag, a local statue (i assume), and a big 50 cent. So moving back to a purely typographic masthead may be a stretch for them. I'd definitly loose the flag. And the large 50 cent (everyone in winslow knows that). If the statue is in fact a Winslow landmark, I would consider keeping it (or some other town landmark) and using it in a **Winslow (statue) Mail** configuration. Make it an engraved or scratchboard looking illustration, not a photograph\n\n"

In which case show her the NYT with its Cheltenham! :-) If she's gonna insist on something more elegant and contemporary, then something like Swift would be great, yes. But I'd try to keep the feel homey, so maybe something like Cheltenham but not as mushy.   \n   \nBut I wouldn't use Cheltenham for body, it's too old and small on the body. Wait a second: I never thought I'd recommend the otherwise abominable ITC Cheltenham, but for news body (at a small enough size, like maybe 8 point) its obese x-height might just click. Maybe give that a shot.   \n   \nFor Cheltenham I was thinking more for the masthead. Here's the ITC \"handtooled\" in action:   \n   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-cheltenham-handtooled/cheltenham-handtooled-itc/testdrive.html?s=Winslow+Mail&p=72](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-cheltenham-handtooled/cheltenham-handtooled-itc/testdrive.html?s=Winslow%2BMail&p=72)   \n   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-cheltenham-handtooled/cheltenham-handtooled-itc/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW+MAIL&p=60](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-cheltenham-handtooled/cheltenham-handtooled-itc/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW%2BMAIL&p=60)   \n   \nBut if you want a more dignified look you need to look at the \"real\" non-ITC cuts (which cost more, though).   \n   \nHey, what do you think of this?   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Winslow.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Winslow.gif)   \nPeople have told me that my Patria caps have a Cheltenham feel, but the serifs (which actually need work, though) are \"severe\" wedges. If you like it I can give you an EPS of those settings. But the font itself (which is actually designed as a newspaper text face, in four weights with italics) will cost you... :-)   \n   \n\\> I would lobby hard to remove [the ads] from the masthead.   \n   \nFailing that at least don't allow color ads above the masthead line.   \n   \nBTW, this might sound like blasphemy, but don't jeopardize the redesign by trying force a font sale. There are probably a lot of bundled fonts on your machine, a few of which (like maybe Nimrod\\*) would work better than Times.   \n   \n\\* Which I once got from MyFonts for cheap.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I think most our body text is set at 10pts, you think it would work at that size?   \nWe do have some decent alternatives already (perhaps) but i'm none too keen on the intricacies of the text face (i'm more of a display type of guy) Last night i was playing with that front page and and tried using Hoefler Text, Joanna, Georgia, Garamond, Galiard, Goudy just to see how these faces would look. Georgia is a personal favorite of mine (and it's based off of Miller isn't it?) But the rest i didn't really feal comfortable with, except maybe Hoefler Text.   \nAbout the ads... i totally agree that they should go below the nameplate, personally i would like to see no ads above the fold, but i don't know what the advertiser's contract is.   \nAbout the statue.. his name's \"Easy\" from the Eagle's song \"Take It Easy\" and the one line that says \"I was standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona...\" I was wanting to make him more graphic instead of having a photo of him, but again, my publisher doesn't want to see him in the nameplate (because of local politics, you know how it goes in a small town) But i may still do one mock up with him in there. Alternatively other graphic elements I could use are the railroad or perhaps Route 66.   \nJust for fun i'll upload a few more nameplates that i found while digging through our archives. ![The original in 1897](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25690.gif)   \nMy publsiher liked this blackletter.   \n ![Nameplate 1927](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25691.gif)   \ni like the nostalgic feel of this one, although i'm not sure whether the train station is the heart of the city (maybe i should stick the local Wal-Mart in there instead, LOL)   \n ![Nameplate 1936](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25692.gif)   \n ![Nameplate 1942](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/25693.gif)   \nA couple rail inspired motifs.   \nOh and i forgot to mention, Winslow is on the border of the Navajo reservation and we're trying to appeal to that audience as well, however i don't really wanna see an overtly southwestern/native design scheme. keep the comments coming, i'm getting some good ideas!\n\n"

They have a PDF of it you can download it and print it out, and have the phone number for this on their site. I'm sure they can clue you in on what will work for your paper stock, press, budget, etc.   \n   \nThe Gerard Unger stuff is also a great idea, and designed and proven for newspapers.

However, you should know up front that for the fonts in this series, FB requires a minimum license for 25 workstations. This aspect of their business is geared toward medium and large newspaper operations, not small-town weekly papers like yours, unfortunately.   \n   \nNevertheless, the Newspaper section also features some of their more readily available Retail fonts which they feel work well for newspaper use. This information will at least give you ideas, even if it doesn't offer solutions within your budget.   \n   \nBest of luck.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

Although I've seen it work well in magazines, I would not actually recommend it for newspaper text. A while ago, at their request, I did some preliminary explorations of some condensed headline versions, which haven't gone anywhere yet, and one day I may try to create a newspaper text version.

      "content": "Ok, here's some free amateur opinion, probably worth what it costs, based on your PDF of the front page.   \n   \nI don't think fonts are your main problem. Times New Roman was eventually changed by the Times itself, but it a very good face, if your paper is not too rough. (The sharp points on the serifs melt if the paper is not good enough, I understand.)   \n   \nI suspect you can make the paper look a lot better even with Times as the body text. First, I would look at how the Times (of London) itself used to use it for a clue.   \n   \nI suspect that you have too much leading in the body text, and that tightening it would make give the paper more even 'color' and a more professional look. (Also, your font size may be too big for the narrow columns.) Second, Times bold isn't the best as a headline font, but if you use it, I suspect it should be tracked negatively for large headlines, so you get a bolder, more punchy look.   \n   \nFinally, all the centered text in the blue box on the left is a definite no-no, as it is way less readable, and there should never be over a few lines centered.   \n   \nI would think that with a new masthead and headline font, and improvement of the typography, you could make the whole thing look quite good, even with Times.   \n   \nAnother more radical revision to think about is having fewer columns. I believe the NYT has the six columns. Narrow columns as less desirable from the point of view of readability, but that way NYT can start a lot of stories on the front page, with headlines - in the narrow, tall Cheltenham. However, you have your headlines going across a number of columns, so that the many columns doesn't particularly help you.   \n   \nAs I said, I am just blathering about this stuff without knowledge, but anyway these are the kinds of questions you can ask about revising your present design.   \n   \nThere is a [Society for Newspaper Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.snd.org/) and on their site they have a searchable list of books on newspaper design, including books of award winning designs. If you call them they can probably tell you of a whole division of small town weeklies, and you can talk to your colleagues who are in a similar situation, and get practical, valuable advice.\n\n"

In fact the best way to beat it is to use a WIDER font with a bigger x-height, so you can set it smaller and with less -total- leading. The CPP will be worse than Times for a give point size, but the overall surface area used by the other font in a _small_ point size will be less (without losing on apparent size), at least for news text (which has a lot of linebreaks - which negates the space savings of narrow designs like Times).   \n   \nBTW, check out these:   \n   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW+MAIL&p=72](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW%2BMAIL&p=72)   \n   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=Winslow+Mail&p=72](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/bold/testdrive.html?s=Winslow%2BMail&p=72)   \n   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW+MAIL&p=72](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=WINSLOW%2BMAIL&p=72)   \n   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=Winslow+Mail&p=72](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213608/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/testdrive.html?s=Winslow%2BMail&p=72)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
