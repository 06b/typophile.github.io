If this is bold, and if it is Gotham, I have seen the bar on the \"e\" thinner when it is set to bold, black or ultra.\n\nIs it a typeface other than Gotham?  \nIs it possible that the designer adjusted the bar?  \nAre my eyes playing tricks on me?\n\nI would appreciate any help in ID'ing this font, thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123033649im_/http:/typophile.com/files/new_hope_3830.jpg)\n\n",
