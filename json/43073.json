      "content": "Tomas, beautiful! Děkuji!  \nI love the ‘g’.  \nI know, it’s a freebie, so I’m not really entitled to make any demands – but as you laudably have included all those diacritics, do you think it’s possible to do an ‘ß’, too? And in case you find that unsuitable for a unicase face, is there a technical way to automatically substitute ‘ß’ by ‘ss’? I just stumbled across this minor flaw: By assigning Metalista to a little text in InDesign, all the ‘ß’ instances just disappeared. No warning, no empty box, nothing.\n\nF\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, Tomas! You've fixed it :)\n\nFlorian, I think the easiest solution would be to put two S into the ß glyph slot. But this post wasn't posted in the critique section, so we're content with what we get ;)\n\nEdit: Using the \"All Caps\" feature in InDesign automatically turns the ß to SS, so that could serve as workaround.\n\nJens\n\n"
