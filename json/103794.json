      "content": "I suspect this is something created as a private font to reinforce the product image of the publishers line of romance novels.  \nThe terminals for both fonts are some sort of a swoosh design -- perhaps to suggest romance. The angled font seems to be a tweeked version of the top font.  \nSome of the ideas found in the font date back to 19th century designs.  \nNote the R with a sharp angled shoulder on the leg. This is found in at least one readily available font, [ITC Tiffany Heavy](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013152216/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-tiffany/heavy/glyphs.html) designed by Edward Benguiat in 1974 based in part on Ronaldson, a very popular 19th century font with huge serifs on the arms. Canada Type has revived [Ronaldson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013152216/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/), cut by Alexander Kay for MacKellar in 1884 and designed by Rebecca Alaccari in 2008.  \nThe huge serifs on L & E in your image could have been adapted from the Ronaldson/Tiffany design by making the serif alignment more vertical and clipping off the spurs protuding below the baseline and above the caps height.  \nDon\n\n"
