  "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI'm doing a small survey of typography, comparing design students to design professionals. Please answer the questions that follow. It should only take a minute or two. Please included whether you're a student or a professional.\n\n1. Favorite Typeface  \n2. Most Used Typeface  \n3. Guilty Pleasure (you know that you shouldn't love it)  \n4. Most hated (get pretentious!)  \n5. Preferred method of adding emphasis (italics, bold).  \n6. Preferred Typeface (Choose one. List derived from separate typophile thread)  \n Bodoni  \n DIN  \n Frutiger  \n Futura  \n Garamond  \n Gotham  \n Helvetica  \n Minion  \n Scala  \n Univers  \n7. Favorite letterforms, upper and lowercase.\n\nThanks Typophiles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  \nEither post here or email me at [reganfredjohnson@gmail.com](mailto:reganfredjohnson@gmail.com)\n\n",
