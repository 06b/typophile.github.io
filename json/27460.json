  "content": "Hi  \nThis word mark isn't a comercial work. Its intended to work as a mark for the concept I've been illustrating on my free-times.  \nThe characters I've drawn for the word mark \"SHAPERS\" are based on the idea of molding, shaping, metal or some other similar material.  \nI'd appreciate some advice/feedback concerning the H character specifically since I couldn't get it to fit this concept, but also on the remaining characters draw and the word respective kerning.  \nThe typeface on the sentence below is Plexes by Dino dos Santos. However, probably I'll get rid of it.\n\nBest Regards  \nDave\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [typophile1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019105439/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile1.jpg) | 52.25 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hi, Thanks for the tip Lex, I'll try it and see how it looks.\n\nWell, actually SHAPERS stands for nothing other than a personal non-profitable project which evolves several illustrations done by me depicting the concept of shaping forms, digital forms in this case. Therefore, Shapers are the ones who do that, who shape the forms.  \nI felt like I could try and work on a word mark for the whole thing just for the fun of it, rather than something as serious as a client work.\n\nCheers\n\n"

      "content": "I think it's nice. I agree with Lex about the 'A'. The 'H' is a difficult shape, not as fluent as the rest, you need three strokes to complete it.\n\nBut I think your solution is OK, I mean, it's not distracting or whatsoever and it covers your idea explained.\n\n"

      "content": "You could try altering the angle at the bottom of the A but the base type seems to need quite a lot sorting out, where the inside curves become sharp and the gaps between strokes, the diagonal of the S looks a bit light, the H needs work to fit in with the other characters.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "Hello All\n\nTim, thanks for the advices.\n\nI haven't had that much time to work on this during this week. Although I made some changes here and there.  \nI've made all the inside corners into curves mainly cause I didn't had a strong reason to keep some sharp and some rounded.  \nI've also worked on S, R, P and E characters strokes. On the A, I've tried the lowercase solution but it seemed out of place, so I tried to make it look more triangular in order to resemble more an A than an O.  \nThe H, I still gotta find a solution to make it work here.\n\nKeep the comments coming. They're appreciated.\n\nBest Regards  \nDave\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019105439im_/http:/typophile.com/files/shap_5202.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Perhaps you could close the counter of the P more like the A (or open the opening for the A slightly) the two together look strange with different gaps. For the H you could look at combining two curved sections, for example the vertical of the E where it makes the centre bar. The S's are better but I think you can still work on the curves on the outside they seem to start too far up the diagonal.  \nTim\n\n"
