Go to the [Unicode charts website](http://web.archive.org/web/20090809181640/http:/unicode.org/charts/) and find the chart that covers this script: that should tell you which character you’re missing.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster’s stopped working.\n\n"
