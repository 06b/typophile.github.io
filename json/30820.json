Earlier in his career, Morey did a prestigious stint at Peter Saville Associates, where he collaborated on designs for Factory Records, New Order, and The Haçienda. Now an independent design consultant, Morey works with high-profile clients such as Arena, Asprey, Diesel, Environ Records, The Face, Giorgio Armani, KesselsKrammer, and Vogue. His latest venture, a publishing company dubbed Editions Eklektic, serves as an outlet for personal expression in the form of silkscreen prints, greeting cards, and other media. Morey's ongoing interest in pop and urban cultures is evident in the Club-21 collection of stencils, dot and square matrix, modular, LCD, typewriter, signage, and mechanically produced fonts.\n\n**External Links**  \n [Club-21 at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205003745/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?mID=60)\n\n",
