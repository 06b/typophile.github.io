Mighty Tuxedo -- particularly the Short Caps [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/mighty-tuxedo-aoe/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414205106/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/mighty-tuxedo-aoe/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/mighty-tuxedo-aoe/\") is similar to Washington as a candidate for editing, but you would have to start with its thicker stokes and thin them as required. If the objective is to do a full uppercase alphabet suitable for compressed signage like ARRIVÉE I would start with Mighty Tuxedo.  \nDon\n\n"
