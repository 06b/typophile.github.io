  "content": "Hello,\n\nMy boss has lost the screen for one of our T-shirts, and he needs me to remake it in Adobe Illustrator. I was not the original creator of the design, and I'm stumped as to what fonts are used. The bottom one \"University\" looks like a typical varsity font, but the top one is giving me trouble. I tried to clean up the image in Photoshop and use whatfontis.com, but my graphic-art skills are limited, and I had no luck. If anyone could identify this font for me, or suggest a close alternative, I'd be most grateful. Cheers!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317061225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bighittersmall_6430.jpg)\n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317061225/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
