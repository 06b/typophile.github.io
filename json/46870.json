  "content": "Check out our eco-bag!\n\nFeatured in the DECOB exhibit that opened in Toronto last night at  \nKeep Six Contemporary Gallery.\n\nHand Made Eco Bag Show – Eco-Bag / Eco-Life runs from June 26 - July 6, 2008\n\nArtists from around the world were invited to participate in this exhibition and asked to use cloth bags as a canvas to express their thoughts about global environmental issues. The hand-made eco-bag, Decorated Eco-Bag (aka DECOB) will be shown to international audiences in an effort to raise awareness of environmental issues and as a call to take active initiatives.\n\nGreat idea, and some super fine bag designs came out of this! The show will be doing some international touring, be sure to check it out if it reaches your city.  \nThis exhibit will travel to the following cities: Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, London and New York.\n\nAll original works will be for sale.\n\nAlso available limited edition print bags by artist Jade Rude,  \ntypotherapy + design and Keep Six\n\nKeep Six Contemporary 938 Bathurst Street, Toronto, Canada  \n [www.keep6c.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012130626/http:/www.keep6c.com/ \"www.keep6c.com\") www.typotherapy.com\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012130626im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/typo-bag_4354.jpg)\n\n",
