It looks like maybe it is, but stretched funny.\n\nAlso, if you know where I can get it for a PC (preferably for free), that would be awesome.\n\nThanks!!!\n\nKenny\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [laugh out loud full.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060716093909/http:/typophile.com/files/laugh%20out%20loud%20full.jpg) | 15.59 KB |\n\n",
