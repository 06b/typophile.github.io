I made a request like yours over a year ago. I didn’t get a big response. Probably because I worded it a bit like you have. To get a conversation going here it’s good to assert something or ask a specific sort of question. The more general the question the less likely people will respond. There are several good reasons for this believe it or not!\n\nBTW, you may want to lok at these folks’ work:\n\n[http://www.lineto.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007193824/http:/www.lineto.com/ \"http://www.lineto.com/\")\n\n"
