  "content": "For the first time in my career, I have to design a fashion catalog in 4 different languages : English, French, Chinese and Russian. I have no problem setting type in French and English (since Montréal is bilingual), but I'm a little confused with the last two languages.\n\nThe copywriters will send me the final texts in a couple days. So far, I have no idea what its going to look like.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know anything about setting type in Chinese and Russian. Should I use Cyrillic characters for Russian ? Are there a lot of typefaces available in Roman/Russian/Chinese ?\n\nHow should I set the punctuation in Russian ? Same as in English ? Do they even have punctuation in Chinese ?\n\nAnybody has a good resource website for this issue ?\n\nSo many questions ! Any advice will be much appreciated !\n\n",
