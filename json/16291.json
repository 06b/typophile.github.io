The new typeface needed to be clean, multi-lingual, accessible and ownable.  \nA modified version of InterFace now carries the identity, not only in the UK, but all over Europe, including Greece and Russia.\n\nmore at [http://www.daltonmaag.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020443/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/ \"http://www.daltonmaag.com/\")\n\n",

(just out of curiosity..)\n\n- on your site we see the reworked logo of MIGROS. what was your part in the redesign of their identity? are you happy with the rounded characters? was a whole charset create (as a private work, just to learn something, i'd maybe try to do this.. but if it already exists, im not sure if i will)\n\n- you designed the new \"kiosk\"-typeface, right? what was the briefing there? as a normal customer (with high affinity to design and type design) i must say that i dont really like the whole identity (i love parts of it, but i think its too round, too \"unsharp\") - again, what was your part in this work?\n\nif you have time to answer these two questions, i'd be very happy. im aware of the fact that you surely have to do lots of other things, so if not, a short note would be appreciated, too.\n\nthierry blancpain (from switzerland, too, by the way)\n\nPS: just as another information, im doing my first try at a \"real\" display-font, and the rounded details in the mövenpick-logo inspired me. thanks!\n\n"

      "content": "Thierry,\n\nsorry for not responding earlier.\n\n- Migros. We worked on the logo development, commissioned by Wirz Identity in Zurich. Although there was once talk about designing a whole typeface it never came off. I am happy with the logo lettering in as far as the crafting is concerned. I believe though that Migros could have been a little braver and departed more radically from the old identity. But as you know, Migros is a cooperative society set up, so too many people and committees became involved.\n\n- Kiosk. No, we only refined the logo. We had nothing to do withthe typeface.\n\nHope this helps. And sorry again for the delay in answering.  \nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag Ltd\n\n"
