  "content": "Hello All,\n\nI am looking for a free small x-height serif font that has the minimum printing space usage characteristics of Linden Hill but is a regular serif and not a slab serif.\n\nI would also like to know if it is possible to design fonts using a computer instead of manually drawing them on a drawing board. If it is, what are some good application programs to use to design fonts.\n\nThanks for any feedback you can provide.\n\nJim Williams\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Jim,  \nI'm afraid I don't know much about free fonts, but I can say that if you're looking for spatial efficiency, a small x-height is counterproductive. It's the printed size of the band occupied by x etc. that determines type's apparent size, so the smaller the x-height, the larger the point size required.\n\nOn Windows, most people use [FontLab Studio](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416211928/http:/www.fontlab.com/) (or, for beginners, the same company's TypeTool) to design fonts. On Macs, [Glyphs](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416211928/http:/www.glyphsapp.com/) has become popular. There's also the free and capable but slightly forbidding [FontForge](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416211928/http:/fontforge.github.io/en-US).\n\nBy the way, \"slab serif\" usually implies serifs that are particularly thick, not just rectangular, as in Linden Hill (which is really Fred Goudy's Deepdene, renamed probably for legal reasons).\n\n"
