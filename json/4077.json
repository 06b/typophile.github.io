  "content": "This was my first attempt at a sans serif, with accompanying true italic.   \n   \nThe idea behind it was to make a humanist sans with some of the organic curves and other elements of old woodcut serif letterforms. As such, much of the italic was actually developed before the roman. Also, many of the characters suggested alternate possibilities, so I've developed an alternate set as well.   \n   \nDavid Thometz   \n   \n ![atlantis.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075329im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/326.jpg)   \n ![atlantisitalic.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075329im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/327.jpg)   \n ![atlantisalternate.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075329im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/328.jpg)\n\n",

The only instances where the   \nlittle terminal curls don't work for me are when   \nthey come in so tight (lc 'a', ital lc 'm', 'n')   \nbut I suppose you could specify use for display   \nsizes only - it being a quirky wood type after all.   \n   \nAlso sad about the \"spear\" terminals (lc 'f',   \n'j', 'r', 't', 'z'. They don't seem to fit in.   \n   \nOverall you've managed a nice balance and I'm   \nsure that much was difficult to acheive. You   \nmust be a fan of Emigre. I see traces of Base   \nand Triplex in there. Did you consult John Downer   \nabout those italics? ;)   \n   \nStephen\n\n"

      "content": "Heh heh.... Actually, you are correct, to a point. I do in fact like many of Emigre's faces, especially those of Licko and Downer, Triplex and Base included.   \n   \nThe italics and alternates (many of the alternates are upright versions of the italics, you may have noticed -- kind of a backwards evolution, I guess) indeed took inspiration from Base and Triplex, but also Bauhaus forms (lc \"m\", \"n\", \"r\", \"u\", \"w\" \"x\" and \"y\", among others) as well as some woodcut serif forms (most of the numerals and all characters with a tilde-shaped horizontal stroke).   \n   \nThe tight terminal curls (lc \"a\", ital lc \"a\", \"m\", \"n\", et al) were inspired by Jonathan Hoefler's Leviathan Italic -- an italic design which I absolutely love.   \n   \nAnd the caps... Well, the caps were origianlly going to be mostly sloped romans, but I wasn't happy with that. I wanted as true an italic as I could get, so I wanted that to include the upper case as well. Base and Goudy Sans gave me most of the ideas for those forms, as well as other serified italic forms.   \n   \nStephen: I'm not sure I understand your criticism of the \"spear\" terminals (lc 'f',   \n'j', 'r', 't', 'z'). Do you mean in the roman, the italic, the alternates or all three? And what about them doesn't fit?   \n   \nI've had some degree of success using Atlantis at text sizes, especially the italic and alternate sets. I'll try to post a waterfall text setting soon to show you how they work, but until I can get Flash to work properly, I'm still a slave to JPEG images on 72-dpi screens. ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075329im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nThanks once again for all your comments. This forum is an invaluable resource!\n\n"
