  "content": "Hi,  \ni am searching for a font which is used in EA's 1999 Need For Speed High Stakes (NFS4 EA Canada). Thought of using it for some Artwork.  \nIts mostly used in headlines, although it seems to have only lowercase letters.  \nThe font is stored in a file called \"Galext18.ffn\" ... maybe thats helpful (btw renaming to \\*.ttf does not work).  \nIn the attached image I cut together different samples from menu and loading screens.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824183433im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Unknown_6037.png)\n\nI couldnt find any information so far and \"What the Font\" did not show any helpful results. Are there other image based search engines?\n\nIt would be awesome to have at least a similar font.\n\nThx4Reading  \nGreetings\n\n",
