One shameful thing is to have coupled such superb letterforms with such horrid spacing. Another shameful thing is that so few designers who use it are paying attention.\n\nhhp\n\n"

There is something quite wrong there. Emigre fonts are “designed” for graphic designers, other than that they technical disasters. There is something quite wrong with them that I suspect has to do with a failure to understand the relationships of letterforms one to another. The only thing I can compare it to are those depth perception tests you take during an eye examination. Is this letter closer to you than this letter? Well, imagine erratic accumulation of color on a letterform relative to another letterform, and that’s what you get. Letters jumping out at you. Maybe letterpress functionality should be the litmus test of type design.\n\nGerald\n\n"
