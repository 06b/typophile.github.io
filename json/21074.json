Yes, it's a humanist sans so there is a connection to Centaur somehow; but it's also, in a sense, a geometric sans that'll provide the needed contrast.\n\nOn a side note, I've found that [FF Kievit](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020173248/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=kievit) (my new favorite sans!) works well with almost any Garalde out there.\n\n"

I love type/letterforms, but am far from being an \"expert\" at identification, etc; I'm here to learn.\n\nThanks for the suggestions, Bram! I did try Gill, but it wasn't quite right. I'll look into FF Kievet...\n\nThanks to everyone for their help.\n\n"

There is nothing inherently wrong with it, it's just that we could have had something much better. (By the way, my son recently picked up an abridged version of Narnia, set in Centaur, probably because there are centaurs in the book!)\n\nJust because Bringhurst and Dean Allen pointed that out to you doesn't mean Centaur is unusable.\n\nNow for companion -- Centaur for titling works well, so perhaps you don't need one?\n\n"

In my opinion, it truly changes everything, from being able to get a more faithful version of Centaur on metal to getting that warm, charming look on print.\n\nAfter all, ginapaloma, in a world where offset and gravure run the cogs of commerce, taking part in the creation of a letterpress ephemera is every typophile's dream -- a romantic one, we can say.\n\nSpeaking of which, your color scheme is really interesting. I've seen a color similar to PMS 396 used in a small press' short-run bookmark, but I never saw the likes of PMS 271. I would love to see how it all worked out.\n\n"
