(;\n\nI have to say I do admire a good name in a typeface though, since coming up with that perfect name can take almost as long as the actual designing of the darn thing! Or maybe it's just me.\n\nAnyway, what's your favorite typeface name?\n\nMine's \"Bembo\". I could walk around and say nothing but Bembo all day, just because it tastes so good to say. Bembo. Bembo. Beeemboooo. It's delectable!\n\n",

Doesn't exactly roll off of the tongue though. Not exactly junk food in that regard.\n\nI think the \"darn thing\" probably took a great while to cut (design was not a consideration). They didn't even bother to name \"letters.\" I doubt they even considered there was such a thing as the delectable, unless of course, they were thinking of the type of righteous life that would lead to salvation.\n\n"
