Does anyone out there know where to obtain this material?  \nThanks.\n\n\"I would like order for a type mould which are used in hand  \ncasting type, plus its matrices of 14pt, 18pt and 24point in Times  \n Roman upright in alpha-numeric and their punctuation marks inclusive.  \n At our workshop I have three platen letterpress, I find a lot of stand  \n stills with scanty types. I kindly ask you to get us this kind of  \n mould so that we can revive our letterpress machines.  \n Kindly send us quotation plus shipping charges to Kampala,Uganda East  \n Africa. \"\n\n",
