      "content": "I like the one on the bottom left. Nice ampersand. The right leg of the \"R\" is a bit funky — looks stretched to me. Although I like the idea of the ampersand leading into the \"flight streak\" of the plane, I don't really like how it tapers down towards the plane. Try making the plane bigger so that it matches up better with the thickness of the ampersand (and you wouldn't need to taper the trail). Also try it without the trail through the \"D\".\n\nGood start here.\n\npenn\n\n"

I want to keep it quite geometric and not too organic.\n\nWorked a lot on the letters and ampersand, everything is custom. What do you guys think?\n\nStill not too sure what to do with the aircraft... any ideas?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131117083839im_/http:/typophile.com/files/R&D%20logo2_3794.jpg)\n\n"

There also are tips on how to insert links and other formatting details below the comment box (as your links above don't lead to where you want them to).\n\nThese latest sketches are good, but I prefer the ampersand from the bottom left (with the closed top) as opposed to the ones you've been playing around with in these later sketches. The lettering is looking a little futuristic to me in these newer sketches because of the pieces taken out of the \"R\" and the \"D\". I do like the airyness of these later iterations (due both to the increased spacing and also the outlining of the characters. Lot's of good ideas to experiment with here.\n\npenn\n\n"

      "content": "The plane is almost certainly too detailed compared to the rest of the logo. So simplify it a bit. Ampersand adds quite a substantial amount of detail into the logo but it's too sans serif to complement the details of the plane.\n\nTo me the most promising logo was #4 in the first batch of logos. It connects both letters and the plane and doesn't leave R outside of the mark.\n\nLogos with only half the plane don't work with me.\n\nOne more thing. If you'll combine outlines with flats (as in logos in the second batch), be very careful about it because it usually tends to complicate application if not done properly.\n\nBut other wise type choice is very good for R&D lab.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

Please check attached image.  \nPersonaly I like it because it's simpler and more compact.\n\nI wonder if :  \n- right leg of R should be widened a bit  \n- if D is ok as is  \n- does it still reads as R&D even without the ampersand  \n- do you still think the aircraft should be simplified or it complements and add richness to the type?\n\nThanks again for the help!\n\n[http://typophile.com/files/R&Dlogo4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131117083839/http:/typophile.com/files/R&Dlogo4.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Does it actually matter that it has to read R&D, because I think to me it's the same either RD or R&D.\n\nthe serif style of the plane is now more appropriate since you introduced stroke variation to the letters thus complementing them to the plane.\n\nI think that plane in the middle is also a very nice solution. Did you also try to add a mid line before R to symbolise plane trail? Just an idea. Try if it works. It may unballance R since it's more wide on top than bottom (missing stem)...\n\nYou could remove tapered wing ends. It's the only one thing that feels distracting on the plane to me... And try moving the plane a bit more to the left because it looks like it's closer to D at the top than bottom or is it just me...\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
