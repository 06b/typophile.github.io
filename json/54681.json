  "content": "Does anyone else find that ellipses are too often used for malicious intent. I understand that part of their function is to indicate a dramatic pause, but I find them hard to decifer especially with text messenging and emails. They always seem to imply a sense of irritation or impatience. Maybe my point is that they are digitally overused.\n\nDracula gives an example of the malicious ellipses: \"I never drink ... wine\"\n\nAnyway I wrote a post on my take of ellipses if you are interested.\n\n[http://www.typeandglyph.com/2009/02/dot-dot-dot/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023195841/http:/www.typeandglyph.com/2009/02/dot-dot-dot/ \"http://www.typeandglyph.com/2009/02/dot-dot-dot/\")\n\n",
