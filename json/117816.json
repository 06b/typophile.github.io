The idea is quite simple: A squarish grotesk with open apertures. I would be very happy to get some comments and suggestions.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_1_4468.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_2_3532.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_3_4123.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_4_5964.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Turbine_TypeSpecimen_2014_5_5657.gif)\n\n",
