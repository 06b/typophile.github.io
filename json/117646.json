  "content": "Design 1 – T-shirt  \nTo create a new T-shirt design to promote the work of the Salvation Army.  \nYour task is to design a T-shirt that could be sold online to promote the work of the Salvation Army. You will need to capture the essence of the Salvation Army, whilst still showcasing your creativity and artistic flair. You will need to create an original approach using bold colours and graphics within your T-shirt design that is suited to both men and women .  \nOut of the box thinking is greatly encouraged. Let your creativity run free to explore techniques and imagery, but still keep the Salvation Army purpose in mind. The design must be bold and eye-catching and inspired by your knowledge of the Salvation Army.. The T-shirt needs to be creatively branded, taking in contemporary style and trend. As part of the solution you are to research and brainstorm what the Salvation Army means to you and come up with a clever catch phrase and design on what you want the T-shirt to say and mean. The words “HOPE” and “COMPASSION” come to mind but are only a guide. You can also refer to their vision statement.  \nYour design must include one image. It can be a photograph or illustration that has been taken or designed by you. The final design must be created in the Adobe Suite. Any hand drawn images will need to be traced or scanned and imported into Illustrator. Images can be enhanced with Photoshop.\n\nFirstly, this particular design that I created using Adobe Photoshop consists of nine layers. Three images have been used – to set them apart, the male shirt has a photo of founder William Booth and the female shirt has a photo of founder Catherine Booth, the Salvation Army logo itself and the famous peaked cap you often see a Salvo Officer wearing. The remainder of the design is made up of two typefaces – Copperplate Gothic Bold for ‘1865’ and Edwardian Script for ‘est. & secure your freedom’.  \nI believe this design is not your typical supporter shirt consisting of simply a logo and a slogan, it is fashionable which would lead to more people wearing it. It is also up to date with today’s trends in that it contains large bold type, it has actual photographs rather than drawn images and the opacity of ‘1865’ has been lessened to reveal an underlying image adding it’s individuality as a supporters shirt.  \nThe reasoning behind this design is to convey to the audience how long The Salvation Army have been operating. The human eye is drawn to the Salvation Army logo first as it is the only image that contains colour, which tells the viewer straight away what the design is about. ‘1865’ comes into view next which for most people describes a particular year as it is a four digit number. Whilst reading ‘1865’ the viewer can then notice that there is an image in the background which shows that that particular person is possibly ‘behind’ this highly-regarded organization. Moving on the viewer will read the slogan ‘secure your freedom’ which was chosen due to its similarity with The Salvation Army’s actual slogan ‘we’re about people finding freedom’.  \nOverall this shirt is sending a very powerful message, The Salvation Army have been assisting others less fortunate then themselves for years and that they’re here to stay. It also promotes their strength, loyalty and reliability.\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [VE000521627\\_Assessment\\_2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317190435/http:/typophile.com/files/VE000521627_Assessment_2.jpg) | 173.75 KB |\n\n",
