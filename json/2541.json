Apparently they must tolerate everything, even people who are sworn to kill them. And if Israel does _what any other country would do_ in response to 50 years of continuous attack by multiple self-proclaimed enemies, then they are called 'Nazis'.   \n   \nWhen the Nazis began their persecution of the Jews in Germany and then in other European countries, had the Jews sworn to push the Germans into the sea? Had the Jews declared that Germany had no right to exist? Had the Jews repeatedly launched multiple armies against Germany? Had the Jews conducted decades of terrorist campaign against German civilians?   \n   \nMaybe while you're visiting the Weisenthal website looking for reasons to gag, you should read some of it.

Your statements seemed to me be antisemitic. Criticising the policies and actions of the Israeli government is not antisemitism; calling them 'Nazis disguised as Jews' is. Gagging at the combination of 'human rights organisation' with 'Jewish' looks like an antisemitic reaction whether it is consciously intended as such or not. I'm not singling your statements out, Gerald; over on Typographica we had Hrant evoking the stock antisemitic international Jewish conspiracy theory with his 'dark undercurrents of international lobbying', and his bizarrely veiled references to a 'party' and 'people' with an agenda (whose 'tool' I apparently am because I disagree with Hrant); again, I don't think Hrant is necessarily intending to be antisemitic, but he is using terms and evoking ideas that belong to that discourse.   \n   \n   \n\\* In the sense in which the term is clearly and unambiguously understood by pretty much _everyone_. The insistence on the dictionary definition of Semite to negate the use of the term antisemitic is itself a well documented strategy of antisemites, who seek to deny the unique historical phenomenon of antisemitism in European culture. Other forms of European racism -- anti-Black racism for example -- are no less ugly and indefensible, but they are of a different character (in large part because they have not developed over almost 2000 years and are not so ingrained -- so ingrained that even people who do not consider themselves antisemtic hold Jews to standards that do not apply to any other peoples). The term antisemitism has been used to describe this phenomenon for a long time: when 19th century racialists wrote about 'the Semite' they meant a Jew. Individuals may, more accurately, be anti-Jewish, but their statements -- and even the statements of people who do not consider themselves anti-Jewish -- are likely to belong to a long tradition, and that is what we call antisemitism.\n\n"

If you were to say so, most Jews would think you were an antisemite!_   \n..........   \n_A Jew is any person whose mother was a Jew or any person who has gone through the formal process of conversion to Judaism._   \n.........   \n_It is important to note that being a Jew has nothing to do with what you believe or what you do. A person born to non-Jewish parents who has not undergone the formal process of conversion but who believes everything that Orthodox Jews believe and observes every law and custom of Judaism is still a non-Jew, even in the eyes of the most liberal movements of Judaism, and a person born to a Jewish mother who is an atheist and never practices the Jewish religion is still a Jew, even in the eyes of the ultra-Orthodox. In this sense, Judaism is more like a nationality than like other religions, and being Jewish is like a citizenship. See What Is Judaism?_   \n.....................   \n   \n_In the 1980s, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Jews are a race, at least for purposes of certain anti-discrimination laws. Their reasoning: at the time these laws were passed, people routinely spoke of the \"Jewish race\" or the \"Italian race\" as well as the \"Negro race,\" so that is what the legislators intended to protect.   \n   \nBut many Jews were deeply offended by that decision, offended by any hint that Jews could be considered a race. The idea of Jews as a race brings to mind nightmarish visions of Nazi Germany, where Jews were declared to be not just a race, but an inferior race that had to be rounded up into ghettos and exterminated like vermin.   \n   \nBut setting aside the emotional issues, Jews are clearly not a race._   \n      \n   \n [http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm#Nation](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010202740/http:/www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm#Nation)\n\n"

It's just denying a part of the past, one that in my opinion should not be forgotten. Probably the next step would be to photoshop out any sign of a swastika from their photos in Encarta. I actually read a newspaper article a long time ago, where a teacher was demanding that the school board remove all photographs of Hitler and especially any photo with a swastika in it as supposedly they promote hate crimes. Now, maybe I just had teachers with a different sense of the cirriculum, but I remember WWII being explained as a dark time for humanity, not a promotion for Nazis.   \n   \nIn short, as soon as we start to forget or wash over things that have happened in the past that we did not like, they are bound to happen again. If Microsoft is so worried about people's reaction to the swastika, then why not start an education program on what the swastika means and why it should not be forgotten instead of erasing a very important part of world history?\n\n"

The plight of the Palestinian people is being used to legitimise hatred of Jews that is not new, is not a result of the situation in the Middle East, but is the same old cancer of hatred that has characterised European attitudes to Jews for centuries. I happen to think that it is perfectly possible to criticise the Israeli government and security forces, identify Ariel Sharon as the war criminal that he is, oppose the building of settlements in the occupied territories, favour the existence of a Palestinian state, etc. without accepting even a whiff of antisemitism.   \n   \n   \nHrant, I am not being spineless in recognising a distinction between the expressions people use and their intent, especially in this emotional and historically charged discussion.

They've simply grown up in a culture that has 1600+ years of ingrained prejudice behind it, and in a Church that has a long and problematic relationship with Judaism (despite the recent Vatican teachings against antisemitism). So maybe I'm particularly sensitive, but when I see careless language concerning Jews I'm very aware of how that is received by many people: with a nod and as a confirmation of their prejudices, and as a very hurtful threat against the security and lives of Jewish people. I don't have a problem with anyone being critical of Israeli policies -- I even accept arguments about whether the state of Israel should exist as legitimate debate --, but please, people, be careful how you phrase things and don't let your protestations be fuel for hatred of Jews.

I will refrain from posting any links because there are far to many. But I use the UN as my standard. Theirs and the complaints made by \"many\" other human rights organizations. I know people think \"human rights organizations\" are just a bunch of \"zannies\". As you can see I made the same mistake about the Museum of Tolerance. Anyway, it's a bad habit to think human rights organization are run by zannies.   \n   \nEspecially democratic zannies that lectures on human rights issues to developing nations on a regular basis, including China. So that been the case, it should be alright to complain about human rights abuses in places such as Israel where their isn't any. Hence the gag comment, sorry it was so distracting. Maybe I am too unkind. Maybe that is what the Jewish Human Rights is all about. It is only for the Jews. I don't know, sure looks that way to me.   \n   \n_I happen to think that it is perfectly possible to criticise the Israeli government and security forces, **identify Ariel Sharon as the war criminal that he is,** oppose the building of settlements in the occupied territories, favour the existence of a Palestinian state, etc. without accepting even a whiff of antisemitism._ John.   \n   \nYou are aware that comments like that can make you a pretty unpopular chap.

No, not at all, despite the fact that Muslim armies assaulted Christian lands in the Middle East and Europe for a heck of a lot longer than the crusades lasted.
