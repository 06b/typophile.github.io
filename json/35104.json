  "content": "Hello,\n\nI posted this in the SoCal Type Fanatics section, but there wasn't much response there, so I'm reposting here.\n\nI’m looking for someone to (letterpress) print some business cards for me. I’d prefer a local company (Los Angeles, USA). It seems like [Aardvark Letterpress](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414055921/http:/www.aardvarkletterpress.com/) is pretty well respected.\n\nDoes anyone recommend a different company or have any comments or advice on where to go? It doesn't necessarily have to be local, but I would prefer if it were.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
