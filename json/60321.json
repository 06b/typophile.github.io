If you look at old manuscripts and even early printed books, you will see many abbreviated words -- the abbreviations were a way to save space or make words fit. (By the way, I just found a PDF on early American tombstone inscriptions [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024020327/http:/www.davidrumsey.com/farber/Early%20American%20Gravestones.pdf).)\n\n"

For example, one \"THE\" uses an HE ligature, but others don't, and isn't YE just an archaic form of THE? It's almost like the stonecarver found his layout needed these adaptations to maintain symmetry on the face of the stone, as each line is centered. Almost as if he worked from the edges toward the center.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
