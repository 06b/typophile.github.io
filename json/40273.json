  "content": " I’m looking for fonts to go with the project mentioned in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421204433/http:/typophile.com/node/40250): a [_Firefly_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421204433/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series))-related book. The two genres for the book are science fiction and Western, and I’m wondering if there are fonts with a ‘feel’ in both directions.  \n Don’t need old-style figures, but I do need book and titling weights, an italic suitable for long runs of text, and a complementary alternate form—a matching sans-serif, perhaps, or at least with a similar x-height and color, but readily distinguishable from the main text. I can fake small capitals if need be. The Gentium Book/Fontin combo I've tried [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421204433/http:/typophile.com/files/Hanging%20Chinese.pdf) doesn't work too well.\n\n Also, is the Chinese font I’ve used (MS MingLiU) the best choice, or can someone recommend a better Chinese titling font/weight? (I.e., a more calligraphic font, still in Song style.)  \n—Joel\n\n",
