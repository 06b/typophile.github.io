  "content": "A new typeface designed by Göran Söderström – Heroine.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230513im_/http:/typophile.com/files/blog_sept9_09_6106.jpg)\n\nThe typeface is due to be released on September 15, 2009. So until then we've done a little promotional trailer for you available at:\n\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Ml2n\\_jfSk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230513/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Ml2n_jfSk \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Ml2n\\_jfSk\")\n\nInspired by the typeface Windsor, designed by Eleisha Pechey in 1905. Windsor is the typeface used in the titles of many Woody Allen movies. A modern interpretation of this rusty pearl is something that always have been missing in the major type libraries. But Heroine is not only an interpretation, it goes beyond that. With the addition of swashes and alternate letters in several styles it becomes very addicitve.\n\nMore images here:  \n [http://www.fountaintype.com/news/2009/09/heroine-movie-trailer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230513/http:/www.fountaintype.com/news/2009/09/heroine-movie-trailer \"http://www.fountaintype.com/news/2009/09/heroine-movie-trailer\")\n\nEnjoy!\n\n",
