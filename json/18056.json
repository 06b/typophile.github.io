  "content": "Dear Type Gurus of the World,\n\nI am looking for some advice on Art Deco style font that would be good to use for wedding invitations. The wedding will be held in a great, old theatre that has a sort of Art Deco flair so I want to tie the invitations into the setting. Being that this wedding will not be held in a traditional setting it is not absolutely necessary to follow the traditions of formal or script type or design, but I do still want to keep it classy.\n\nThank you in advance for your help and insight,\n\nDuncan Robertson\n\n",
