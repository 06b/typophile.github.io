The forms are broked and destroyed which give a wear away apperanced. The strokes and bars pass the limit of the guidelines which broke the visual references effect, like all most of overshoot references. Zeit Geist function better as display font because don't have a legibility concept to use as text.GIF / JPG:   \n ![Text Description](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416043715im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/202.jpg)\n\n",

Scott Makela's \"Dead History\" (1990) ( [http://www.emigre.com/PDeaR.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416043715/http:/www.emigre.com/PDeaR.html)), but it is pretty obviously a very different design.   \n   \nThe same could be said about Max Kisman's \"FF Fudoni\" (1996) ( [http://www.fontfont.com/shop/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416043715/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/)), but again, it is quite apparent to me, anyway, that \"Zeit Geist\" is an original design, borrowing (and only partially so, at that) from a similar idea.   \n   \nI like the direction Zeit Geist is going, especially in the lower case italics. The lc italic \"x\" is especially interesting in both weights.   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
