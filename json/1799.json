  "content": "Open is a design studio in New York City. Our work includes identity systems, print (such as advertising, packaging and publications), motion graphics and web design. We help people figure out what they need to say--and use design to say it in ways that surprise, engage and inform. After years of waiting and months of work, we've completely rebuilt our site, with entirely new content and lots of things to look at.
