Try kerning them closer, but I suspect that you'll have to connect them as you did with the rest of the letters.\n\nThe descender on the \"G\" may be aggravating the disturbance by breaking up the line.\n\n"

      "content": "IMHO,\n\nMore space is needed between the two words. La is too far apart, and L is a tad too small. I would try enlarging the L and dropping it beneath the a, pulling it much closer - kinda like this, but much less messy:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419124607im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lakers_6595.jpg)\n\nI think my dirty example here shows the L too big, but you get the idea. I'm not convinced it works much better, but I still think the L you have is problematic.\n\n"

You and your partner did I great job. I hope my design did it some justice. (I swear it was nothing personal that I squeezed it, removed the inktraps and blurred it to death ;)\n\nSo your a Lakers fan? That's awesome. I do most of the graphics and design (although we haven't updated in a long time) on [LakersGround.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419124607/http:/forums.lakersground.net/), though I'm not a pro like you.\n\nI designed the logo you see there a while back. Everyone seems to like it but I'm getting bored of staring at it all day every day. Thus this thread and possibly additional ones. =)\n\n.  \n.\n\nBTW here's a **[sexy photoshopped](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419124607/http:/i44.tinypic.com/vyl6w6.png)** version of the logo for those that are bored.\n\n"
