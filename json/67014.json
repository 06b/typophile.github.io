  "content": "I'm gathering research for a typeface I'm currently developing based on circles (just want to make sure it's not too close to anything that already exists) — can anyone suggest some typefaces that are based on a circle?\n\nObviously there are faces like Avant Garde that are inspired by the perfect geometry of a circle, but can anyone think of more literal examples? A good friend of mine, Rick Banks, has digitised his own homage to Hoffman/Bayer in F37 Form (attached) that is as close as I can find.\n\nAny help gratefully received...  \nThanks  \nM\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 10.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027074034/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2010_17.png) | 99.77 KB |\n\n",
