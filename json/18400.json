Unless the ’repro’ adds additional creative content somehow. And unless the ’repro’ is actually a collection of reproductions (as the collection itself can be rights protected).\n\nI am, of course, no lawyer.\n\n"

Crown copyright of published literary, dramatic or musical works expires 50 years after publication. Crown copyright of unpublished works expires the later of 125 years from creation or 31 December 2039.”\n\nIf you mean the typography, Wikipedia says: “Of ordinary works, copyright in typographical arrangements is easiest to consider. It subsists for 25 years from publication of an edition.”\n\nDunno if that helps.\n\nT\n\n"
