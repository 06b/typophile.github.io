(If not, please let me know, and I'll keep it in mind for the future. ;-)\n\nI'm looking for a calligraphic typeface that includes a lowercase \"e\" with a swash extending out from its midpoint. (Does that description make sense?) The kind that would generally only be used when the \"e\" is the last letter in a word or line. Searching through all the calligraphic typefaces on, say, myfonts.com is time-consuming and rather tedious, so I thought I'd see if anyone here has some good recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance—  \nConnie\n\n",
