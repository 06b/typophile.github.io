None of the composition works for me. and I am not sure why. Below would be the current name card design i am working on. i already went through a few sets which my lecturer is unhappy with. Would help lots if someone could post a link to where i can find out more about facsimile layouts. Thanks!\n\nabout the design.  \nthe design is supposed to show how the state is a state that is mountainous and has an abundance of mineral and fertile soil. hence the graphic and colour scheme.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824151811im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dyecutetcnc_5228.jpg)\n\nlooking forward for critiques. :)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Kelvin\n\nWhat I notice is a difference in form and typography.  \nYou used a serif for the name, but a very open typography (somewhat like the Avant Garde, can't see well what it is.)  \nThat doesn't work for me.\n\nThere is a kind of romance in the colors, the lettering for the logo. But the name, phone etc. has a very cold dimension.  \nPerhaps if you alter that, it becomes more of a unity?\n\nFurther, less is more.  \nThe idea of mountains and letting it come back in the design is good, I think.  \nAlthough the forms contrast to the lettering. Not bad, it gives it more attention.  \nBut too much is too much! Keep it simple.\n\nI like the design upper left the best of the once you show.  \nPerhaps the logo should be lifted a bit to clear from the forms. I feel it is to close.\n\nFor the reversed side, you might want to think of placing the phone, email etc. in a white letter on that brownish color?\n\nPlay with it!\n\nLast. The lettering of the logo.\n\nI see that Perak is close together than state. It looks a bit odd to me. Especialy because the 'st' of state gets a lot of attention and stand closer together than 'ate'.  \nThat is strange. I would place state closer together.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nOverall, it has a very nice feel!\n\nBest\n\nRaymond\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with aluminum. Less is more. Keep it simple. In simplicity you will find the greater force. Too much will clutter and draw away the attention and diminish the overal experience.\n\nDid your lecturer say why he/she didn't like it?  \nThat is important. I'm very interested about that.\n\nCan we see the simple one from your first batch? Even if it is not as elaborate as the one you have shown?\n\nAbout suggestions on the font.  \nThat is in a way personal.  \nFind something that will fit your overal idea.\n\nPersonally I always try to use as little fonts as needed.  \nIn this case I might go for the same as you have used in your logo.  \nBut remember, that is not the only choice.  \nPerhaps you intended to create a contrast. If that is what you intended, then you did well. But I think it is too much.\n\nJust try a few.  \nYou will see what works or not.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nRay\n\n"
