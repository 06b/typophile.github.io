  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking at creating a modified logotype based on Imprint MT, however I suspect that this face was originally created for text, not display, judging by the cut.\n\nIn my opinion, these characteristics contribute to it's overall feel of the typeface (and logomark) but I'm wondering whether any optical alterations need to take place - particularly on the arms of the T and E, spur of the S and apex of the A as well as the serif terminals.  \nI feel a lot of these element could work well but would like some second and third opinions...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419172912im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MT_5084.png)\n\n",
