Sorry if they are low-res, as that is all what’s available.  \nAs the game is in Japanese, the last example image is a kana\\kanji string. I don’t know but maybe it might be of use too.  \nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font\\_nakazawa.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918233559/http:/typophile.com/files/font_nakazawa.png) | 3.84 KB |\n| [font\\_fragment.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918233559/http:/typophile.com/files/font_fragment.png) | 5.86 KB |\n| [font\\_onoken.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918233559/http:/typophile.com/files/font_onoken.png) | 4.24 KB |\n| [font\\_rights.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918233559/http:/typophile.com/files/font_rights.png) | 5.04 KB |\n| [font\\_kakushite.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918233559/http:/typophile.com/files/font_kakushite.png) | 15.77 KB |\n\n",
