You have one week to create and submit your entry. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nAs with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize — only the ability to call yourself the best on the block.\n\nLink directly to this thread: [http://www.typophile.com/battle23](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423050943/http:/www.typophile.com/battle23 \"http://www.typophile.com/battle23\")\n\n// REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Image size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi  \n- Color: Black and white  \n- Format: Please save your graphics as PNG\n\n**// THIS WEEK’S CHALLENGE:**\n\n",
