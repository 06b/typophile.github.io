Made a search and did not found anything...  \nI’m preparing a logo for a company that makes 100 years next year.  \nSo I’m looking for a typeface for the “100”.  \nI want a “classic look”, “strong” (bold?), “straith” not italic, sans or not...  \nI made some test and these are is “my results”...  \nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance  \nAntónio\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013104306im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/100_4156.jpg)\n\n [‹ Lowercase serif numbers, anyone?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013104306/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47062 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font Name ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013104306/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47080 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
