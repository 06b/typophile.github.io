Strict monolinear fonts have identical horizontal and vertical stroke width. Practical monolinear fonts have a vertical stroke slightly wider than their horizontal stroke width.\n\nThe best-known example of a monolinear type is [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20141127072201/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura) designed by [Paul Renner](http://web.archive.org/web/20141127072201/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%20Renner).
