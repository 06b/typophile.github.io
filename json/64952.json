  "content": "I would like to label some doors with letters. The idea I have is to have red circles with white sans serifs capitals in them. But that is not a must, I just want them to be well made and clear. I have looked for something that is pre-made like this but with not much luck so far. Maybe this is always a bespoke product. Still, I thought maybe someone here knows a good vendor that has nice pre made ones. Thanks!\n\n",

I thought about hand lettering but in this context I think that like a UI on a web page fancy or interesting is not what is called for. In fact the opposite. I don't think that vandalism is a big concern in this case. I think in some ways the ideal thing would be for them to be made from plastic or vitreous glass on metal. They should be simple and clean looking but not attention getting. Darrel, you are right. CNC may be the way it has to be. I will look a little more before deciding.\n\n"
