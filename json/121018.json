  "content": "The Vtg Stencil series of fonts from astype are based on real world stencils. Vtg Stencil Germany No. 101 is modeled after historic stencil plates from Bavaria.\n\nThese stencils are a unique find. The unevenness of the single plates suggest that they were not produced industrially. The design itself, a blackletter chancery, is a romantic reprise of a style that was common in German writing offices from the 14th to the 16th century. The flourishes stylistically quote the Baroque period. A talented mind, perhaps around 1890, has transformed the textura shapes into a modular stencil system.\n\nOverall, this decorative blackletter doesn't look like a stencil design. Maybe it was originally used by a sign painter, and all the typical stencil bridges would have been painted over in the final work.\n\nIf you're looking for a decorative blackletter font with a unique touch and a romantic feel, you will love Germany No.101.\n\nThe font is avilable at [myfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075450/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/astype/vtg-stencil-germany-no101/?refby=as) and [astype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075450/http:/astype.de/font_v_vtg_stencil_germany_no101.php?fontname=vtgstencilgermanyno101).\n\n[specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075450/http:/www.astype.de/s/specimen/VtgStencilGermanyNo101_web.PDF) pdf\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075450im_/http:/typophile.com/files/001_6134.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075450im_/http:/typophile.com/files/01_4263.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075450im_/http:/typophile.com/files/02_6386.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075450im_/http:/typophile.com/files/03_4922.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075450im_/http:/typophile.com/files/04_5750.png)\n\n",
