  "content": "Hi,  \nI finished the costume book **[Tribal Vibes for Bellydancers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017015748/http:/www.costumegoddess.com/books/tribal.htm)** I mentioned on this forum a few months ago. Thought you might like to see how I used Nick's font \"Blandford Woodland\" in a photo gallery spread. I bought this awhile back cause it's so beautiful, but never could find the right use for it before this.\n\nHere it is titling the \"Shaman\" costuming of a troupe.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017015748im_/http:/typophile.com/files/screenshot-shaman_6402.jpg)\n\nHere's what it looks like in the context of the spread called \"Fantasy\". The facing page featuring the Amazon costume is \"Sultan\" by Cananda type.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017015748im_/http:/typophile.com/files/screenshot-shaman-amazone_4702.jpg)\n\n",

I'm old enough to remember those little adhesive corners that always fell off after a few decades.\n\nYes, I got permission from the person who posted a high quality scan of the silent film actress from his collection.\n\n"
