For my thesis I need opinions about typefaces which were put on the movie posters to study context and typeface together. I have made a online questionnaire. It will take only 15 minutes. If you could help me, Kindly reply to this email Id- [sonikagondval@gmail.com](mailto:sonikagondval@gmail.com) or if you are interested in participating can comment below with your email id. I will send you the link of the Questionnaire.  \nThanks.\n\n",
