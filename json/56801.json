Go to the Multiple Master section of Font Info and set the default Weight Vector to something other than 0 or 1000. This will change the display in the Font Window and you will see any interpolation anomalies that might be hiding.\n\n"

You can see the both masters together all the time, and easy compare details and test the details how they look in the interim weights. If you extrapolate the weights at the same time (with the slider) it is also very easy to see errors. Everything is so visible if you for instance go below the 0, and put in -200 or something.\n\nFurther, you can kern them both at the same time, build your sidebearing system so it is compatible, put in all the OT-features, classes etc.\n\nIt is also good because you will have the exact same character set through out the family without even thinking specially about it, no glyph will be forgotten.\n\nI always make the fonts as ready as possible in the MM-project, so when i pick out the weights, the only thing to do is to go through the glyphs and make small, small adjustments – and rebuild the kern feature :)\n\n"

      "content": "Could anyone help me? I've been searching for sources that properly explain how to work with masters but to no avail. The only tutorial video I can find is a Polish one, which gives insight into the process but he shows how the master works on only one letter by adjusting it for the light master, while I already designed two weights to use as masters. I read the whole chapter on Multiple Masters and interpolation from the FontLab manual but I feel the information is very incomplete. It's probably complete if you consider more than 700 pages came before it, but this specific chapter on its own doesn't give all the information.\n\nI managed to get steps further by reading your comments. I blended two weights and almost half my glyphs are green now while the other almost-half is white, with some glyphs in red. What does it mean when glyphs remain white? Won't they be interpolated? If not it seems I have to do a lot of manual work either way, but I still like to get as much of the work done automatically anyway.\n\nAlso, I can't find out how to open up the panel with the slider so I can adjust the weight. Right now I just have a font file with two blended weights and have no idea how to proceed further. I'm seriously frustrated with the lack of documentation on FontLab. I always spend hours researching and in the end get nothing done. I always learn things, but it requires a tremendous amount of time to finally find the answers I was looking for.\n\nAnd to clarify, I'm actually trying to extrapolate, though I've never worked with Multiple Masters before so I'm looking forward to do interpolation as well. I designed Light, Regular and Bold and right now I require Black and figured I may be able to do at least some of the work automatically using extrapolation.\n\n"

When you know which instances you are interested in, go to Tools -\\> Multiple Master -\\> Generate Instance, set desired value and OK. New font is open in FontLab. Save and Genarate Font for further editing.  \n10. Open new OTF font in font editing program\\*, merge saved previously feature file. Edit your mark and mkmk features if needed, make all accented glyphs from composites.  \n11. Check your new font in real applications, make corrections, add hints etc, generate final font.  \nOf course you can do it in quite different way, this one looks good for me.  \n\\* FontForge or VOLT\n\nI.
