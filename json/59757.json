  "content": "Hi,\n\nMy first post on Typophile. Some friends and I put together an online magazine for which I - an amateur graphic designer - did the layout. A lot of my inspiration for the layout came from Intelligent Life magazine.\n\nIf you have a moment, please have a look I would greatly appreciate any critique.\n\n[Exhibit Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422211740/http:/exhibitmag.co.za/)\n\nThanks,  \nRudolf.\n\n",
