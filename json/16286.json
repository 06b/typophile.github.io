  "content": "hi,\n\nI’ve been playing with this logo for a few days. This is for a record label’s web site. Right now, with how it is, it doesn’t really click.\n\nI was aiming for a russian/constructivist look with the bold usage of red and black, but i don’t think the type serves this purpose. The typeface is Akzidenz Grotesk Bold, what do you think would fit in better?\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [kk.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200630/http:/typophile.com/files/kk.gif) | 3.08 KB |\n| [kk3.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200630/http:/typophile.com/files/kk3.gif) | 4.72 KB |\n| [kk4.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200630/http:/typophile.com/files/kk4.gif) | 4.34 KB |\n\n",

However I think the type will be better if he would be separate one of the other and make it bigger and larger. Sans is a good choice but if your’re not sure about that typeface try something else to see the look it will give. What do you think about that one:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/gusto/black/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200630/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/gusto/black/)\n\n"

      "content": "If it’s realy constructivist you want & it’s a logo I suggest you get in somne books & make your own! They are fairly simple to make - but probably less simple to make REALLY well. Stil, an original solution for type in a logo is always a little more ideal because it catches the eye better. If you want a super fast solution there is always ‘constructovist’ from P22\n\n[http://www.p22.com/products/constructivist.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200630/http:/www.p22.com/products/constructivist.html)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/Constructivistov_r1_c1.gif)\n\nThe other thing is that so far you are giving me a swiss modern or post swiss feel not a constructivist one. They were big on wacky energtic angles and didn’t go in for the degree of reductivism/simplicity you are using so far. Again, crack those books!\n\nAnd lastly, they were big on using human figures even if they were pretty abstracted\n\nCheck this out\n\n[http://www.a-website.org/design/pictohistory/pics/constructivist/kozlinskii.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200630/http:/www.a-website.org/design/pictohistory/pics/constructivist/kozlinskii.jpg)\n\nBut I like what you made too.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

      "content": "thanks for the suggestions so far.\n\ni think you’re right about the proportions, but i have a thing for the horizantal stroke of the kk. i think they give the abstract/graphic kk feeling better.\n\ni think my choice of typeface takes the whole feel of te design from consrtuctivist to minimal… i’ll try to come up with a home-made face for the logo based on the suggestions of EbenSorkin. The way i see it, when i change the face i’ll be able to be bolder with the kk icon.\n\nOne thing i found out is that the letter K is very difficult to manage and tame.\n\nbtw, “Korkunc Kayitlar” is turkish and roughly means “Terrible Records”, terrible with a double meaning, either scary or good as in “terribly good”.\n\nthanks for your time and suggestions, i’ll post the updates.\n\nea\n\n"
