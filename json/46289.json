I don’t think there is anything amiss in the well-drawn department, but considering all the things I’ve said in my life about various versions of you-know-what-ica, I’m always interested in a Swiss point of view. ;)\n\nCheers!\n\n"

The clearest sense of the change would probably come from looking at an ATF book and then at the FB material.\n\nI hold the metal franklin gothic in very deep esteem\\* so I admit it’s is a bit disconcerting to see this new one. I’ll have to let you know in time if I still cling to my sacred cow or not. If you asked me today I would probably have to cling.\n\nIn any event, if what you want is a fairly pure continuity with the old metal face but with more weights etc; then this release is probably not what you are looking for. But then that’s not everybody...\n\nCeratinly if ITC wants to name it “Franklin Gothic” then I think that’s their right.\n\nAnd if you would have preferred it otherwise I suppose it’s your right to complain.\n\n\\* Maybe too deep. On the positive side though I can definitely say that pondering the mystery of why FG looked so very fine to me was one of the first steps I took on the road to designing type.\n\n"
