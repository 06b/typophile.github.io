  "content": "Raising the Em dash question yet again.\n\nI generally set the em dash tight. Recently, a text I'd sent to our translation services came back with comments to space them em dashes. I am wondering if this is language-specific (like spaces before colons) or the translator has donned her typographer hat. I'm tempted to ignore the corrections, but first I would like to get a sense of em dash use in French texts from the francophones out there.\n\nThanks!\n\nKristina\n\n",

These are all from France, though; Canadian usage might have more anglophone influence.\n\n"

Hyphenation rules are another source of frustration for me, but I do have a photocopy of guidelines provided by the translation office. I'm sure that with a few more reference books I could contribute less to the translator's headaches... :)\n\nThank you everyone!  \nK.\n\n"

But mostly, in English, I can look up a word in the dictionary, and the hyphanation is indicated. There's no guessing involved. As I understand it, French relies on syllables, pronounciation and other factors, which make it a little iffy for me to get right. I have yet to find a French dictionary that shows the breaks.\n\nChrisL: Somewhat ashamed. I played with that feature once, albeit very briefly. However, I usually hyphenate manually, and only in places. But mostly, I really wasn't sure how it worked. Does the language apply to selected text or to the document as a whole? Often I have both languages in one document. To be honest, I was too lazy to figure it out. ... I'd rather know the rules than rely on the software, anyway. ;) (That's my story, and I'm sticking to it!)\n\nI hyphenate in English manually, too, and check each break in my Canadian Oxford. (And yes, I also search my hyphens.)\n\nLinda: Thanks for the extra references.\n\nK.\n\n"

For example, I had a paragraph style for first paragraph of text, which was not indented and included oldstyle figures and a nested style with the first 4 words in small caps. Every following paragraph was the same, but indented and no small caps. With one click in the paragraph, I could format the whole thing, including the italics, and not have to worry about selecting text. I've used character styles, for example, to create the nested small caps style at the beginning of the first paragraph.
