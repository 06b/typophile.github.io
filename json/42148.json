  "content": "Good evening,\n\nIn searching for ambigram designs, I came across the Typophile website. I was wondering if anyone with ambigram experience either knows someone who could create an ambigram for me or would be willing to do so. I would very much like to commission a particular piece.\n\nThank you, in advance,  \nJill\n\n [‹ Best application for \"offline\" fonts browsing/cataloguing...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080719172820/http:/typophile.com/node/42151 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Rock Band - Typography affecting my enjoyment of things. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080719172820/http:/typophile.com/node/42145 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
