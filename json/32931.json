  "content": "hi,\n\nI am looking for a type with the following features:  \n- an antiqua, readable even in miniscule sizes;  \n- serifs are cut strict and straight (like in Times, not like in Garamond or Filosofia);  \n- axis inclination minimal or none; especially the \"8\" should stand still;  \n- nice \"G\" :)  \n- no slab-serifs.\n\nThe goal is to see if I can find a type, which can do better than the Times in a logotype, which I have to work with (and promote) for the following years to come. I guess, the designer either wasn't a specialist in type, or wasn't looking far enough (I tend to think, it's the first case).\n\nThe most tough application of this logotype I've met, was a laser engraving on a product, which [the engraving] measured about 1/2 inch × 1/4 inch. I will try to push the \"idea\" of a signette instead of 4 words of the brand, but it will definitely take time.\n\nSo.... ?\n\n",

Thank you, Stephen.\n\nI was also looking into Candida and High Tower, which I like the most - except that serifs details will be lost completely, when engraved in small sizes. Hmm..\n\nHere, I will show you what the point of the discussion is (see the image).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013185731im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ho8_check_4698.gif)\n\n"

I mean, at these sizes it is not really important to try to save the serifs. You just might get the picture of the applications of the logo...\n\n"
