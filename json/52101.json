  "content": "Hello!\n\nI am working on a text panel for a museum exhibition for a show about modern art from Kyoto. I would love feedback, ideas, criticism - don't be shy. This is a new job for me, very type heavy and any support I can get would help me a lot.\n\nSome questions:  \nDo you like the \"nesting\" of the type?  \nDoes the orange line do anything for you?  \nWhat do you think about splitting up \"modern art from\" and \"boston's sister city\"?  \nand anything else you can think of...\n\nSome issues to consider: it has to be vector and simple, it's a modern art exhibition of ceramics, prints, and textiles.\n\nThanks!  \nLee\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [kyoto2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823024626/http:/typophile.com/files/kyoto2.jpg) | 94.55 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Lee,  \nAre you still working on the logo? It's been a while since you've posted this...\n\nThe first thing that jumps to mind is \"Why Univers?\". Univers is sooo commonplace and without character, great for small print, but certainly not my first choice for a logo.  \nI like the nesting, though if it were me, I would try some variation in sizes, and maybe put them more toghether even.  \nThe placing of the orange line is strange. Why not at the top of the x of \"Kyoto\"? I even wonder if you need it at all; I always think that when a line is needed in a typographical logo, it isn't designed well enough. For me personally: loose the line.\n\n"
