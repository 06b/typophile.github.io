      "content": "Hello Cyrus. Just popping by to offer a brief testimonial -- Cyrus' class is a great one, and a rare opportunity to get your hands dirty with type design in an intensive course. I had the pleasure of popping in a few summers ago to see the extraordinary things that his students had accomplished in just a week, and I've now got the good fortune to employ one of his very talented alumni. So sign up!\n\n"
