I have a client I'd like to create a logo with it for...\n\nI love it and it fits their business perfectly,just curious about your thoughts on the font itself?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [priori\\_acute.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013185124/http:/typophile.com/files/priori_acute.jpg) | 261.2 KB |\n\n",
