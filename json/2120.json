Like I say I was pleasantly suprised, I agree that the E doesn't feel right to me and the placement of the 'cells' looks odd... haven't got time to do too much so it's easier just to show a a quick suggestion   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010181540im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20756.jpg)\n\n"

If you continue in the direction you're heading I would have two possible suggestions: (1) extend the \"E\" horizontally, as it appears too small relative to the other letter forms, and (2) increase the serifs of \"x\" to be slightly larger than that of the \"y\" (or just lose the \"y\" serifs), as the \"y\" appears gargantuan compared to the other letterforms. If you decide to move a little further, you may try softening the serifs so there are less hard angles (again, maybe losing the \"y\" serifs). One more thought\n\n"
