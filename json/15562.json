However, Cochin has too many curves. Bodoni and Fenice get too thick. Filosofia is too curvy. I need it to be very tight, sleek and sharp with serifs. I think I may have to just create it myself.\n\n [‹ type suggestions](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180740/http:/typophile.com/node/16751 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [About Aspect ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180740/http:/typophile.com/node/16747 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
