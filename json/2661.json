Of course details will not match in each font, like the serif on the 'i', or the curved 'l', or the open lower bowl on the 'g'.   \n   \nHowever, finding an equivalent seems like an odd exercise for such a ubiquitous font. Doesn't Microsoft give it away?\n\n"

That was the main point put to   \nme by an upper level MS Typography rep who actually replied to   \nmy e-mailed inquiry (boy, was I surprised).   \n   \nOutside opinion, based partly on the timing, was that Linux users   \nwere being pointed to those fonts by many Linux resource sites   \nand were grabbing them in very large numbers.   \n   \nCertainly it's MS' right to do with the fonts what they choose, but   \nincreasingly they have been choosing to slap their customers   \nupside the head. The user of a properly purchased MS application   \nwho has a font that has become corrupted cannot simply get a   \nreplacement off the installation CD. The fonts don't exist as indi-   \nvidual files.   \n   \nPersonally, I feel that, after making sure that Arial, TNR and, to a   \nlesser extent, Verdana are specified in millions of HTML pages   \naround the world, MS ought to make these fonts available to all.   \n   \nOf course, as Justin showed, the fonts are available elsewhere.\n\n"

It's there so that users can   \nobtain updated \"euro enabled\" versions of the fonts. Plainly   \nmissing are the regular Arial variants, Georgia and Times New   \nRoman.   \n   \nIt also likely does nothing for the many folks without MS apps   \nwho visit web pages coded for Arial, TNR, Verdana, etc. I don't   \nknow for sure about this download, but most MS installations   \ncheck for a valid MS application\n\n"
