I've actually seen it in use in a magazine ad from a few years back. See [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215120750/http:/www.chromespinners.com/images/buick_logo.gif) image. As for Pontiac, it's the font they use for their [Grand Prix](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215120750/http:/www.usatf.org/events/2001/USAIndoorChampionships/images/indoorChamp01.jpg).

I'm certain it's not a modified Delta for a logotype, because the ad uses this custom font. Fabio, I have seen Larabie's font, however I doubt General Motors would use it. If anything, they probably use a font of their own. I've seen commercials with this font, and a Pontiac brochure used it as well.\n\n"

I don't have any good pictures of it yet, as cameras are technically not allowed in the building.\n\nit's really gorgeous type, and most of it is falling apart, which is real shame\n\n"
