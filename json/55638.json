A loop might work, or maybe look at the \"B\" for guidance and have the tail grow out of the left side of the bowl? (Not sure this would work.)\n\nThe \"C\" has an underbite to my eyes. May also be a bit wide (and I agree with Craig that it's short, as well as the \"G\").\n\nI think the \"H\" may need to be wider.\n\nOne thing that strikes me as odd about the \"J\" (other than the left side of the curve, which somehow doesn't work) is the long left-side head serif. All your other horizontal serifs seem to be shorter (even on the \"F\", which might benefit from a longer one on the right), so I'm wondering why you're making an exception here.\n\nI think the shape of the \"U\" is somewhat amiable! But you may want to work out the inner vs. outer curves a bit more smoothly where the curve grows out of the stem on the left side.\n\nIs this going to have lowercase?\n\n"

I do intend there to be a lower case as well, and I agree the lengths of the serifs on F, J etc may need some more work-also widening the H and narrowing the C could indeed be a good idea.\n\n"

It's mostly the left-side onset of the tail that looks \"arbitrary\" to me – it feels like the tail doesn't deeply \"connect\" to the bowl, it's just kind of hanging somewhere.  \nAlthough that loop you made is cute too. :-)\n\n"

      "content": "A: The area over the bar seems a bit tight against the one below. I agree with Craig that lowering could help. The serif on the top looks too heavy compared to the lower left serif.  \nB: I'd look for guidance in the E and F to balance both bowls. Though I like the bar as is, I think it would take benefit from their sisters.  \nC: Some of our curvy letters (C, G, O, Q) could need to overshoot up and down a bit (as D and S do it at the top). Perhaps it's wide also, as Nina says, but I'd like to see it taller before judging that.  \nD: The stress seems much a bit, and makes it look slightly heavy.  \nE: I like it as is.  \nF: The serif at the right side of the stem needs to be quite longer to provide support.  \nG: The same as the C. I'd work more on the small spur.  \nH: It's too narrow in comparison, especially with the N or the O.  \nI: Well, it's the master glyph...  \n&: Very nice shape. I agree with Craig it's out of character.  \nJ: It deserves a hard work. Look at the U –mirrored– for some help.  \nK: Where did it go? :-)  \nL: Might it be narrower just a bit?  \nM: Good as is.  \nN: I'd cut off some serifs here and there. Perhaps it's me, but it seems too busy. I like it as a whole, anyway.  \nO: See my thoughts on the C. Nice balance.  \nP: Hmmm... I lost it.  \nQ: You face a hard challenge here. Hear the guys.  \nR: Gone with the P?  \nS: Very nice and smooth!  \nT: I'd only touch the serifs at the base, coz the letter is wide.  \nU: Pay attention to Nina's comments.

I'd like to see an alternate P with the tail of the bowl ascending, more B alike, but not too much.  \nYour R suffers the same lightness in the stroke I pointed for the K; the bowl seems big, perhaps because of this; as with the K, I like the latter version the most.  \nThe S is beautiful as is.  \nI think the U is still unresolved in its inner curves.  \nWith the V and W I have the same concerns exposed about the top serif of the A, but in that case I'm strongly in favor of a thin vertex gently overshooting the baseline.  \nThe X definitely needs contrast (see notes on the K and R); once it's done, you'll need to shift the extremes of the thin stroke.  \nThe Y has a poor contrast as well.  \nI have to say the same about the Z, even though it's quite beautiful.  \nYou'd have to clarify us some questions about the eventual lowercase set, guidance to find a name, and so on.  \nCheers!\n\n**MarS**\n\n"

I'm not sure about saying anything.  \nThe leg of the first \"R\" apparently needs more weight. Anyway, I like the second \"R\", though its bowl is excesively wide.  \nI'm starting to enjoy the \"U\", as well as the V and W.  \nAbout the \"X\", break the thin stroke to avoid the optical flaw that –precisely– makes it look broken.\n\n**MarS**\n\n"

I thik the bowl undershoots too much, or maybe you must compensate the serif.  \nb: Something in the bowl is weird, perhaps the lower part...  \nc: The bottom terminal does not work the same way it does in the e, where I find it balanced.  \nd: I think the end of the bowl where it reachs serif at the bottom of the stem needs more air. Currently, that tie is too heavy.  \ne: I like that design.I'd like to see it in context.  \nf: Both alternates seem pleasant to my eyes (though deeply in my soul I miss the left side of the cross bar).  \ng: Looks good. Need more work in contrast.  \nh: At a very first sight, I like it as is.  \ni: The tittle bothers me, as in the \"j\".  \nj: The tail is bold a hair.  \nk: As previously with the UC, you reversed the weight of strokes. I like the last one.  \nl: No comments.  \nm: As with the \"n\", \"p\", \"r\", IMO the join at the top-left corner lack of light. See my comment on the \"d\". All in all, the glyph is nice.  \nn: Beyond what I said about the m, I like it.  \no: No comments.  \np: Did you added a bowl to a \"j\"? Descending seems too wide...  \nq: Pretty good.  \nr: I'm not totally sure about the terminal, but perhaps is me. Definitely, it needs more light at the white space over the top serif.
