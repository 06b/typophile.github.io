  "content": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew anything about these faces or more helpful to my purposes if they resemble or were based on any roman typefaces from the same period. They are from the Russian futurist book Tango with Cows. I can post more samples if that would be helpful.\n\nNot pictured here are cyrillic types based on Akzidenz, Boomerang, Calligraphia and Antique Extra Condensed.\n\nThanks!\n\nDaniel\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015073723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wedged_6601.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015073723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/notrubens_5267.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015073723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/nottasso_6520.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015073723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/serifcyrillic_4862.jpg)\n\n",

I also thought it looked like [Miehle](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015073723/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-miehle-classic/) which was a Benton design from 1906. Dennis Ortiz-Lopez's version doesn't have cyrillic, but certainly a metal cyrillic could have existed in the 1910-17 time period.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
