  "content": "Is it possible to use (and have access to) the reserved 8-bit slots (especially decimal 129, 141, 142, 143, 144, 157) in a PS Type 1 flavored OTF font?\n\nFor \"reserved slots\" see [http://www.sanskritweb.net/fonts/howto.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107131730/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/fonts/howto.pdf \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/fonts/howto.pdf\")\n\nI need these reserved slots for a few additional glyphs of a private custom-made Devanagari font for 8-bit-encoded huge megabyte files of Sanskrit texts, for which the very complicated Devanagari sorting programs were written by me for 8-bit encoded text files only.\n\nI would prefer here PS Type 1 flavored OTF (instead of TrueType) for ease and fastness of hinting of the Devanagari glyphs.\n\n",
