  "content": "I am teaching a first-year Typography class next semester. While I taught it last year in September, I wasn't really happy with the outcome of the projects nor the structure of the course and how much information I presented to the students. The projects/course content has been regulated (more or less) by the 'higher ups', but this time around, we are allowed to change some of the content and projects. The projects are as follows:\n\n1. Typography only logo design for a new health food store  \n2. Typography only logo for a publishing company  \n3. Layout/publication (the students are selecting an article about a specific musician to be printed in a music magazine. The idea is to get the students to express the music/style of the artist via type w/o the use of any imagery.)  \n4. Package design for a series of office products, focusing on just typography.\n\nMy challenge last year has been integrating the course lectures into the projects. Last year, the framework of the course consisted mainly of material from the typography book, mixed in with some of my own knowledge. Keep in mind this isn't a private art/design institution, but a small dept. within a state system. So there not THAT much room for flexibility. However, this year, we get the green light to change things around.\n\nSo in terms of lectures, how much should I throw at them? None of these students have ever taken a typography course, so this will be a new experience for them. Should I take out one project and increase the value of the other 3, while focusing on lectures? Seeing as the class is only twice a week for a measly 1hr50min, that doesn't give me that much time to cover history of typography in great great great detail. And the requirement that we HAVE to follow is at least 3 projects per semester, with 4 being ideal. My biggest issue is connecting projects with the lecture content.\n\nI am a fairly new professor (2 years of experience) and any advice from more seasoned designers/professors would be appreciated.\n\nThanks Typophiles!\n\n",

Student work gets a lot better when they know about the baseline grid and to not enable optical kerning for body copy.\n\n"

All letters had to be photocopied or hand-traced, and the projects ranged from posters to large format books dedicated to a particular font. We were given short lectures on the history of type, basic terminology and rules, but most of the time was spent developing projects.\n\n1. Simple word collage (photocopier)  \n2. Tracing an alphabet  \n3. Designing three letters that could've been part of a font (tracing)  \n4. Designing a poster (pasteup and tracing)  \n5.

My type teacher usually showed us how to do whatever she was lecturing about, for example, when we learned about grids she showed us how the _Create Guides_ tool works. I think this really helped drive her points home, because (for those of us who had done the reading ahead of time) it was the third time we had heard it, and we were getting it in a different context. I think that it also saved a lot of time during critiques, because people rarely had to point out software-related problems.\n\n"

I would surely cover what are some things needed for making good typography from book usage to ads and brochures. Touch on history of technology and valuable terms a user will need to know. Basic readability explaining the relationship of face, size, leading, line length. etc.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "This is more of advice as someone who loved her typography teacher, but also as some one who has some misgivings about her education.\n\nI do like the choices of projects, they are sort of similar to some of what we did in school. I am glad you are doing office supply packaging- we did food packaging- and I think it was a poor decision, because in the \"real world\" there are more rules for food/medical packaging.\n\nAs a teacher, use the proper names for the different parts of characters, and whatnot. Drill the names into their heads.\n\nYou don't have to teach programs, but be open to answering questions about programs- OR even better- provide a short list of websites at the beginning of the semester of forums and sites with info on InDesign and Quark that they can use to solve problems on their own.\n\nOne last thing...we did a group magazine project- groups of five, and each group had a different kind of magazine. It was a pain, working with other people's styles, but it was fun.\n\nALSO- we had to research a famous typographer- I had Jan Tschichold, and then we designed a poster for a fake exhibition on the person, in their style, or the style of the time period in which they worked. It was fun.\n\nAnyway...my two cents. Best of luck- a teacher who cares is the best kind there is!!!\n\n\"It's easier to tone down a wild idea than think up a new one.\" -Alex Osborne\n\n"
