  "content": "Hi everyone, i'm exploring kinetic typography and movie titles as a dissertation idea, I just wondered if anyone could think of any examples of interesting typography use in opening sequences to films, either old or new, the only one which springs to my mind is the titles of 'Catch Me If You Can' (see below), a style which has been copied quite a lot, but if anyone can think of anything else please let me know.\n\nthanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [catch\\_me\\_title.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015041729/http:/typophile.com/files/catch_me_title.jpg) | 31.72 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "thanks for all the replies guys, this was my first post and i'm astounded by the quantity and quality of posts. some great examples here, most of which i'm familiar with - particularly love the napoleon dynamite's opening sequence, which coupled with 'we're going to be friends' by the white stripes, perfectly captures the innocence of the film.\n\ni'd seen a lot of the work of Saul Bass before, without really realising it was his, and its stunning. part of the titles to 'the man with the golden arm' were copied for the white stripes 'hardest button to button' single sleeve. (you may have noticed i'm a white stripes fan!) Love Wes Andersons work, his attention to detail, and his love of futura (like Kubrick), which is most noticeable in the Royal Tenenbaums...along with Helvetica for the book covers featured in the film.\n\nI've got a lot of ideas, just struggling to come up with a cohesive title/proposal for my dissertation, and a strong direction, but keep these coming!\n\n"
