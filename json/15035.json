I've looked at examples and looked on the internet, but alas I can not find the information that I want (all I find on the internet, is UNicase fonts to download)\n\nI know that it's a full set of 26 letters that has upper and lower case letters (whichever you want to pick) but what it looks like is that all the letters... weither they be upper or lower case, all take up the same space (same x-height?) anyways, can anyone help me with this problem?\n\nFor give my lack of Typography know how... I'm a newbie to all this, but I'm on the road to learning... and slowly developing a love for type.\n\nThanks\n\n",

Typically such fonts are used for setting computer programming code, if also to convey the programmatic.\n\nAnd I hope that's the case, because unicase fonts are generally  \nquite useless (although Panoptica manages to avoid that fate).\n\nhhp\n\n"

Besides Thompson, Licko and Shinn have made good unicase fonts (although those two have had cultural motivations, as opposed to Thompson's more functional one). And from a historical perspective you could look at Uncial.\n\nTry this too:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=unicase](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405011204/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=unicase \"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=unicase\")\n\nBut I'm curious why your teacher wants you to make a  \nunicase font, especially as an early type design effort.\n\nhhp\n\n"

What I wanted to know is do I have to make the lower case letters that I use, the same height and width as the Caps?\n\nShe really didn't touch down on that, as I think we were supposed learn that for ourselves... and from the examples I've seen, the lower case look the samll height and width as the caps... I'm udderly confused, so if anyone can help.. :)\n\n\"I wouldn't recommend sex, drugs, or insanity to everyone, but they've always worked for me\" ~HST - RiP\n\n"

      "content": "If that is a direct quote from your professor, no wonder you are confused. ;)\n\nYou mention width.... Make the widths such that the shapes match; i.e. the letters will all have different widths, but when you combine them, none will look weirdly narrow or wide. Do not try to do what Nick Shinn has done and make them monospaced as well. One thing at a time.\n\nA more important thing to worry about is the weights of the strokes. If you started with UC letters and scaled them down to match the heights of the lowercase, you would have a few letters looking light and small. You'll have to beef up the serifs, stems, and hairlines of the scaled-down letters.\n\nYou might pick a font with small caps already supplied, so there will be less work matching the weights. There is likely to be some difference in height between lc and small caps, though.\n\nFor a very clear example of a unicase font, take a look at [Filosofia](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405011204/http:/www.emigre.com/Volume.php?p=UPEMFILFM) from Emigre. Licko has made a regular family of fonts and added a unicase one for fun.\n\nIt's your call whether the new alphabet is x-height or cap height. Just consider how it will look in use.\n\n"

So here's a little tangent that might help you decide which uppercase to drop in favor of lowercase or vice versa in your unicase design.\n\nLoxley talks about Bradbury Thompson's [Alphabet 26](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405011204/http:/www.pbtweb.com/alpha26/alpha.htm), his project to combine upper and lowercase letters into one consistent set of letters (in essence unicase). Thompson had felt that the variations between upper and lowercases of the same letter were too inconsistent and made it hard for children to learn to read. He eradicated most of the lowercases, except for a, e, m and n.\n\n"

You may even invent your own.  \nThe choice of \"donor\" typeface might have something to do with how your design evolves.  \nWhen I taught the unicase course, I was always thrilled by the wide variety of design solutions that students came up with for the same brief.\n\n"

      "content": "Indeed, \"strategy\", but to me that applies more to the functional realm - a unicase font doesn't have to have style as its only/main objective. In fact, Thompson and Cassandre (Peignot) were both after <cite>improvement</cite>, not fashion: the former like Dana said, the latter because he felt -not without reason- that the lc forms were \"bastardized\" and he wanted to return to the more dignified uppercase roots\\*. So one can make yet another pretty font, or one can try to \"serve\" users.\n\n\\* See my \"Improving the Tool\" for more on that.\n\nhhp\n\n"
