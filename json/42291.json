Look at the bottom of the ’T’ and ’H’ - you can see where they overshot the letters with the X-Acto\n\nhmm, these look like they might be jpg. artifacts or other boogers from repeated digital/mechanical reproduction.\n\nif they actually cut those letters, and scanned them in such a way to show little cardboard shards, wouldn’t there be some sense of depth or texture to the letters?\n\nand if someone did cut them with an x-acto, why get the lines so straight, and arrange them so perfectly as to look ’computer’.\n\nthe various iterations of the same logo don’t feel hand-cut ... or hand-drawn ... and their current logo appears to be a font.\n\nI looked for a higher-res version, but was not successful finding anything bigger than these.\n\ni also emailed the band ...\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if indeed, they are custom letters.
