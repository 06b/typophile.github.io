I know the 4 panels across fold into a parallel fold but what is it called with the other 3 rows added? Does that question make any sense? There are 24 pages all together.\n\nThank you for help in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [PICT0004.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624203136/http:/typophile.com/files/PICT0004.jpg) | 201.46 KB |\n\n",

Do you want a Z-fold vertically followed by a parallel 4-panel fold? Or do you want a tri-fold followed by a parallel fold? Edge to the top or edge to the bottom? etc.\n\n"

Make a dummy. & make sure you and the printer consider how much any type block or image area may “move” as the thing is folded and paper is used up to accommodate the folds and the increasing thickness of the thing. You may have to manually move some items to or away from the folds.\n\nCheck out\n\n[http://www.foldfactory.com/index.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624203136/http:/www.foldfactory.com/index.php \"http://www.foldfactory.com/index.php\")\n\nI did not look to see if they deal with a question such as yours; they might.\n\npowers\n\n"
