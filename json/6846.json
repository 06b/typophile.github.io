I have decided to rearrange the fonts at [my new place of employment](http://web.archive.org/web/20070109163502/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42914.html?1092687773). At present there is a load of free \"fonts\", conflicts, broken families and to make matters worse, most of them are catagorised alphabetically! Urrgh. So I have devised a new method of catagorisation for the mess. Bear in mind that the others using the fonts aren't really typographically aware and \"real\" classifications would probably make it worse.   \n   \nsans�humanist   \nsans�geometric   \nsans�rubbish   \nserif�slab   \nserif�traditional   \nserif�rubbish   \ndisplay   \ndisplay�hand/brush   \ndisplay�dingbats   \ndisplay�pen   \ndisplay�rubbish   \nrubbish.   \n   \nWhaddya think?\n\n",
