I mean, for starters, out of all typeface in the world, why [Caecilia](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010211937/http:/gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/11/18/amazon-kindle-ebook.html)?\n\nHowever, I think that Amazon might have gotten it right this time, because the device was:\n\n- Birthed with a culturally-centered principles, and\n- Built by sociologists and ethnographers\n\nAs quoted from the article:\n\n> ...he [Jeff Bezos] ticks off a number of attributes that a book-reading device...must have. First, it must project an aura of bookishness; it should be less of a whizzy gizmo than an austere vessel of culture.\n\nCompare this with [Sony Reader's](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010211937/http:/www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/):\n\n- Feature and benefit-centered principle, and\n- Clunky reading interface that attempted to mirror exactly the appearance of a physical book or a PDF file (that looked like it was designed by a programmer instead of a sociologist). Look, dudes, with every new medium must come a new presentation model that is specifically suited to that medium, even if the contents themselves are old and dusty.\n\nAs quoted from their website copy:\n\n> The Sony® Reader provides a new way to experience reading. It boasts an impressive display, utilizing breakthrough technology that’s almost paper-like. In addition, the text can be magnified for sight-impaired readers. Daylight readable, high contrast, high resolution, near 180º viewing angle.\n\nI think that if any revolution is to take place, it has to take the human spirit into account. From what I’ve read so far, Amazon seemed to do just that; but it remains to be seen whether those words were true to principle or just extremely empathic/clever PR.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nNote: this article is a repost of [what I’ve written in my blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010211937/http:/linkenfuego.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/though-i-generally-shy-away-from-any-article-that-involve-phrases-like-%E2%80%9Creinventing-the-book%E2%80%9D/), because I think that the content is relevant to our community.\n\n",

I hope it's better in person.\n\nThe biggest problem with the type on Kindle is that paragraphs are full-justified and the layouts are not designed, just plain text.\n\n"

When I want quick, up-to-date documentation I don’t want to mess around with an ebook, I want something like the Adobe help system. Sifting through a PDF or ebook is better than paper, but having it all cross-linked and organized hierarchically in a help app is much more efficient.\n\n"

I’m mighty curious, because our community is pretty steeped in tradition.\n\nFor me, it’s a question of habit. I’m used to reading one storybook at one time before finishing it and moving on to another book. Had I have a habit of reading, say, 3 novels at a time, or doing a comparative study of some sorts, then I might use Kindle to save some space on my bag. That’s the only reason for using that I can think of.\n\nAgain, the question of the day is “why would you ever want to read on an ebook device over a regular book?” I’d love to know all of your opinions.\n\nI also think that if a multifunction device like Kindle is to succeed, it’s got to offer something more than just _convenience._ [After the iPod, everything also has to be _elegant._](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010211937/http:/linkenfuego.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/i-have-now-just-realized-that-the-web-development-software-coda-is-equal-to-iphone-in-spirit/) And I’m not just talking about it in the physical sense, but also in the user interaction and mental sense.\n\n[Watching its instructional video](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010211937/http:/youtube.com/watch?v=BKUKQ7QqOHw) almost made me wish for an iPhone-like interface. Everyone in [lazyeye88’s post](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010211937/http:/typophile.com/node/39250) would agree, no ;^) ?\n\n"
