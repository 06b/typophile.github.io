I'm really just trying to identify a short list of fonts are similar to those that were typically used during that time for these pieces that were made from engraved brass metal dies.\n\nIf you can also please provide information on where I can find these brass flourishes, curves, ribbons etc. that would be very helpful as well.\n\nFor those interested, the collection that includes these beautiful pieces is located here:\n\n[http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/figural-cameos/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042342/http:/www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/figural-cameos/ \"http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/figural-cameos/\")\n\nI'm looking through the type specimens in the following location but thought I'd ask for assistance here as well.\n\n[http://opentype.info/blog/2008/02/18/type-specimen/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042342/http:/opentype.info/blog/2008/02/18/type-specimen/ \"http://opentype.info/blog/2008/02/18/type-specimen/\")\n\nThanks so much for any help with this.\n\nJoshua\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/douglassmoore150_6682.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/edmands150_6322.jpeg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kimball150_6022.jpeg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/blumenthalschina150_3832.jpeg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schaeffersaddle150_3995.jpeg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ddwright150_5023.jpeg)\n\n",
