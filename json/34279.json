Keep it without spaces? Thin spaces before and after the ampersand or the slash?\n\nAlso, in english, is it correct to use superscript in dates? As March 1st, etc.\n\nThanks for the help!  \nEmilie\n\n",

I'm not a big fan of acronyms set in full caps in body copy. But it happens a lot. Especially in annual reports.\n\nIf I was setting the type, I would add thin spaces before and after the slash but not the ampersand. Though this largely depends on the typeface.\n\nAlso, I second Nick's caution about faux small caps and superscript.\n\n"
