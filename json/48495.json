      "content": "Saad, Aziz,\n\nI had a quick glance at this product. In short, Aziz's claim that this is straightforward OpenType with no need for additional technology is not correct.\n\n1. Applications  \nThe Maryamsoft dowload contains an installer that sets up an application directory with executables and fonts. This is proprietary technology.\n\n2. System DLLs  \nIn the Windows System directory Maryamsoft replaces the essential 397Kb usp10.dll, the OpenType layout engine, with a 500Kb modified version. This replacement usp10.dll no longer calls the original Microsoft GDI32.dll, the Graphical Device Interface, but instead a newly installed proprietary GDX32.dll. As a result, Microsoft Windows is turned into proprietary technology.\n\n3. Fonts  \nThe fonts have no OpenType layout tables, but instead use non-standard tables. This could be considered proprietary technology.  \nThe underlying artwork is impressive and authentic, but the outlines as such appear not not to be the work of professional type designers.  \nAs for the font structure, the glyphs are a mixture of letter parts, complete letters and ligatures.\n\n4. Unicode compliance  \nThe concept uses assigned and reserved Unicode character code points for markup as a kind of proprietary technology. As a result these alien Unicode characters interfere with the text structure and data interchange. Moreover, font changes becomes impossible with such texts.  \nAccording to the CMAP, language coverage is limited to Arabic and Persian. And, BTW, the OS/2 table is empty.\n\n5. Uninstalling  \nThe package contains an unstaller utility. It restores the original usp10.dll. However, on all the paths leading to MS Office applications it leaves a trail of copies of the proprietary 500Kb usp10.dll. As a result, there is no de facto uninstallation for MS Office, since these applications will keep encountering the proprietary layout engines before reaching the real one. It requires a manual removal. The replacement graphical device manager, GDX32.dll also needs to be removed manually.\n\nMore to be discovered later. Now off for dinner. After all, there is no such a thing as a free lunch.\n\nThomas Milo  \nDecoType  \n [www.decotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212007/http:/www.decotype.com/ \"www.decotype.com\")\n\n"

Apparently this is case of a different sense of creativiy and self-respect.\n\nWe developed an admiration for and deep interest in Middle Eastern script culture - and try to contribute something useful. We never saw it coming that this would put us in the position of literally or metaphorically having to \"kill or feed\" people who do not respect other than their own property rights. It makes me want to return to the days that I was only interested in dead languages.\n\nAs for the different regional variants of nastaliq, it is an interesting challenge to identify and parametrize the features that distinguish Persian, Ottoman and Urdu nastaliq on the level of script grammar, i.e., competence. The chunky forms, odd proportions and deranged alignment of what led to the likes of Noori Nastaliq and in turn its derivatives, I consider a less relevant dimension, something on the level of execution or performance. From feedback on our own work, I get the strong impression that Urdu users can appreciate the equivalent of a Persian level of performance as long as the competence behind it meets their conventions.\n\nRegarding Decotype ACE, there is no need to speak of \"other\" font formats: for our technology the font format is irrelevant. Today it uses regular OpenType fonts, so any thing on font level, including anti-aliasing falls into that domain. The key difference is ACE as the lay-out engine. It takes the form of an API. Once this is built in, our script output can be made to interact seamlessly with any other engines or scripts. As for justification, that's again in the host engine's domain. The proof of concept is of course Tasmeem, which is capable of handling a lot more languages and scripts than the regular version of IDME. You can download and test it yourself.\n\nI agree with you that there is a need to make our technology widely affordable. We understand the urgency and are actively working on a solution . It's unfortunate that the present situation leads to copying and hacking, but in the end of the day it is a compliment.\n\nThomas Milo  \nDecoType  \n [www.decotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212007/http:/www.decotype.com/ \"www.decotype.com\")\n\n"

As he pointed out there, ACE/Tasmeem _do not_ follow the usual spacing + kerning method, it uses a different method for defining spaces between letters and words.\n\nACE is literally the embodiment of the recognition that \"Arabic is a dynamic script\" so possibly you tell Milo old news. And ACE's above-mentioned different approach to spacing, by the way, is just logical consequence of this recognition.  \n_ad 1_ -- This may be true in the context of usual spacing + kerning method. But as said, ACE uses another method.

Now this is what I would call \"impractical (time-consuming + tedious)\". ACE/Tasmeem does all of this automatically, so you _can_ do manual adjustments if you feel like it but you _do not need to_.\n\nYou are argueing against your own misunderstandings and ascribe to ACE the problems that MirEmad seems to have.

      "content": "Above example was carried out with the 2-years old TTFont of Nastaliq just to demo the power of MireEmad in moving letters up+down, right+left by selecting them + pressing Alt + arrow keys. That font has been rebuilt (not released yet) with zero-spaces (automatic kerning) between letters and minimized spaces between words to be widened manually when necessary.\n\nIn One word, MirEmad does automatic kering for both Typographical + Calligraphical fonts. And it does automatic word spacing for Typographical fonts like Adobe Arabic. But manual word spacing for calligraphical fonts like Rayhan.\n\n@ Tasmeem uses a different method for defining spaces between letters and words.\n\n1. How does Tasmeem define spaces between Letters? By example please.  \n2. How does Tasmeem define spaces between Words? By example please.  \n3. Putting aside the unhappy ligatures, mark-positioning, Kerning and Word-spacing, of page 5/7 from [http://www.fontworld.com/mepdf/Tasmeem4.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212007/http:/www.fontworld.com/mepdf/Tasmeem4.pdf \"http://www.fontworld.com/mepdf/Tasmeem4.pdf\") is messy. Why?!\n\nSorry, my timetable does not allow me to come back before next Monday.  \nSo, please take your time to reply with Pictures.\n\n"

Even better, you should have a separate dll(s), with different name(s), to handle the functionality of the ones you \"hacked\". Adobe Indesign ME uses its own replacement of usp10.dll, it seems, and leaves MS usp10.dll alone. This I think is the best way.\n\n-Saad\n\n"

There could be legal implications, and there could be a danger of making other software not work right (if I already installed the custom version of the DLL that lets me work with Malayalam, that would certainly break, but I imagine that this is an unlikely scenario).\n\nNote that some software that uses alternate versions of a DLL installs with that DLL in the software's own directory, so possibly putting the DLL in the directory of the (executable of) the word processor to be used with the font would be a better alternative - I don't know offhand under what conditions one can substitute a DLL in this way, but I do know that many software packages that come with their own versions of DLLs (a version from Microsoft being the particular update the software requires - many DLLs are redistributable) do such a thing.\n\n"

It's a pity that Microsoft probably wouldn't be amenable to a project to write, using no Microsoft code, an OpenUSP, that not only included the features you use for Arabic, but the extra features many other world languages require - and which Microsoft itself does not have the resources to support.\n\nIt would be somewhat ironic for part of Windows to be based on open-source software - although nothing new, as it does, as the world learned some time back, use chunks of BSD Unix.\n\n"
