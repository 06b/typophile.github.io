  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nIf you would be so kind as to take a quick look at my resume and critique it for me that would be great. I would love some constructive criticism if you have it.\n\nA little background information: It is build on a 32 point grid, typeface is Georgia 10pt size with 14pt leading.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\nEdit: I've edited it more to specific content and added some more work description. I unfortunately don't have much recognition or related personal experience related to design just yet. Would personal experience be considered volunteer work? The engineers without borders project as a volunteer project for free.\n\n",

      "content": "A few things.\n\n1) Under the education heading, lose the high school history. It doesn't pertain to a professional level job. I would also list only your major/emphasis under college history. Axe the college class list as well. If an employer wants to see a transcript, they'll ask for it.\n\n2) If you have any freelance design experience or an internship, I would list it under work experience. There seems to be a definite lack of real world design experience in this section.\n\nYou may also want to reword your job descriptions as they relate to the design world. Deadlines, customer relations, communication, and general organization are all good things to think about.\n\nPersonal anecdote: When I was a student, I worked in a luggage store of all things. Very far from the design world. My saving grace was that I had a lot of experience embossing leather goods at the store (we had a 100-year-old embossing machine). This impressed my current employer in the sense that it used good typographic and hand skills. That, and the fact that you had very little recourse if you \\*\\*\\*\\* up a $2,000 piece of luggage.\n\n3) I might lose the recognition portion of the resume (seems fluffy) and replace it with a personal experience section. Are you bilingual by chance? Have you traveled or studied abroad? Things to think about.\n\nLastly, proofread your resume. You have a few typos and punctuation mistakes, but I won't tell you where they are.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nDOGG : : :\n\n"

I got some great advice.\n\nOtherwise, your resume's pretty good. I would remove the bottom part about references, it just takes up room. Recruiters will ask for references if they want them regardless if you have it listed. Also, try quantifying your resume more. Use numbers, amount of time, $ amounts to describe your work experience in more detail.\n\nBest of luck,  \nHenry\n\n"
