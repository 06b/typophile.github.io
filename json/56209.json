Happy to pass feedback to the designers - in the case of Arial that would be Monotype and as I recall Ascender did the other sans.\n\nProbably too late to change them for Windows 7, but they can always be updated in the future.\n\nAlso most of the sans faces are user interface fonts, that would only get rendered at small sizes in UI. That may be a reason for the design, but could also be a reason to have them stand out more.\n\nAnyway if you have any more detailed feedback please send it directly to me.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"
