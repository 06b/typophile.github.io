Looks very much like ordinary Meta to me. Are Meta and Meta Pro the same design wise? Is Meta+ normal the same as Meta Pro Book? I’m trying to get the cheapest and most effective way out of here...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Meta.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023030822/http:/typophile.com/files/Meta.pdf) | 33.68 KB |\n\n [‹ Bearing gifts to Greeks?

The OpenType version is cross-platform compatible and includes OT niceties like small caps and figures styles built in to one font. The Pro version adds more language support. All use the same lettershapes, the OT and Pro just add extras.\n\n[FF Meta Normal](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023030822/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Meta%20Normal) and [FF Meta Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023030822/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Meta%20Book) are two different weights (Book is heavier) available in any of the three flavors.\n\n"

Just surprised that a large company would have such outdated graphic guidelines (just checked the pdf, it’s from 2002).\n\nMiss Tiffany, interesting link, thanks!  \nStephen, thank you for a detailed help. Now I “only” have to decide on the flavor.\n\n"
