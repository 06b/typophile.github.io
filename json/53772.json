Friends of mine are preparing a small exhibition on Jan Tschichold in the Dutch Graphic Design Museum in the city of Breda (opening end of February). They wondered if there were any of the Tschichold typefaces digititally available. They knew about the Sabon. I'll check also with David Quay of the Foundry for what else he'd know. Thanks,\n\nMax\n\n"
