So, why did you choose your avatar (or opt not to)?\n\nPlease tell me to mind my own business if you like but I'm genuinely interested in how your mind works...\n\nMine's fairly self-explanatory (incuding the lacklustre typography!) but some aren't. For example, why are some smaller than the suggested size?\n\nI'm really intrigued by some avatars...\n\n",

It’s a key letter in the popular orthography of the Tlingit language, representing the uvular fricative, IPA /χ/. When combined with U+02BC Modifer Letter Apostrophe it symbolises the ejective uvular fricative, IPA /χʼ/. This latter sound occurs in no other known language except Tlingit, and it happens to be the first sound in the words for _x̱ʼé_ “mouth”, _yóo x̱ʼatángi_ “language”, _x̱ʼatoowú_ “meaning”, _x̱ʼala.átk_ “discourse”, and other similar ideas.\n\nThe proper typographic support for U+0331 Combining Macron Below is a personal campaign of mine, coming from its extensive use in Tlingit as well as in several other orthographies for indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest of North America. Not having the diacritic in a typeface is one thing, but there’s a surprising number of fonts out there which have the diacritic but don’t actually support its use on anything, or only support it on the precomposed characters specified in Unicode and not on anything else. Notice how the diacritic is visually aligned with the center of the italic X, how it’s approximately the same width as the left-to-right stroke, and how it’s positioned just a bit more than one stroke width from the bottom of the X.\n\nAnother reason for this avatar is because I really love Victor Gaultney’s Gentium and I’m patiently waiting for a new release of the full font...\n\n"
