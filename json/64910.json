  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI wasn't sure where to ask this exactly, but I thought someone might be able to identify what this symbol actually is,&nbsp;perhaps it's name or even what it means. I've scoured the internet and found only more simplistic or more complicated runes. Maybe someone could point me to a better source than I've found...\n\nCheers,\n\nChris\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [RUNE.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051844/http:/typophile.com/files/RUNE.jpg) | 6.4 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Haha, I suppose it could possibly be merely in the style of runes. How disappointing! (though quite typical in these post-modern times). I found it in a mix of various charms. I have found some examples of runes with a central vertical stroke and spines going out either way, but they tend to be all in one direction per side...\n\n"
