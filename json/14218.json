      "content": "The serifs on the uppercase T in Garamond (including Adobe) are very distinctive. They point in the same direction, instead of being symmetrical as in Caslons.\n\nAdobe Caslon’s W (uppercase) comes to one peak, while Garamond’s looks like two overlapping Vs\n\nAdobe Garamond has serifs both at the top and the bottom of the uppercase C while Adobe Caslon only has a top serif. However, other Caslons, such as 540, have both serifs.\n\nThe center bar on the E and F in Caslon don’t stick out as far as in Garamond.\n\n"
