  "content": "Hello hello there you crazy typophiliacs!\n\nI'm happy to be amongst like-minded folks at last. This is my very first post on this site, and I'm not entirely sure what to expect. Anyhow, I'll trow my thoughts out there anyways..\n\nSo basically I'm looking for a tres cool sans-serif typeface with rounded edges. Pardon my lack of adequate vocab here...part of the reason why I'd like to join is because I'd like to broaden my horizon when it comes to such things. So please be patient with me...\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nMerci in advance  \n\\\n\n",
