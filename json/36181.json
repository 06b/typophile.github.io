      "content": "The counters in b,d,p, and q appear to be off-center. The curve of the u appears to be lopsided -- it's tighter on the left. Many of the curved strokes appear to be slighty variable weight, which looks like an accident to me. I think the bottom bowl of the B should be the same as the bowl in the P. The bottom half of the 8 should be bigger than the top.\n\nI like the direction of this; I particularly like the g & k, and the bottom serif on the r & i. I like the diagonal curve on the Z, z, 4 and 7; but I think it needs to be more asymmetrical on the Z and z to not look like a mistake.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n"
