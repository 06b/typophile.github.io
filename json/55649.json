  "content": "I'm in the marketing department of a large company, and we recently adopted a new logo. The logo is mostly text in a fairly obscure font.\n\nI deal with vendors who produce promotional items and non-standard communication pieces (logo in stitching, etc).\n\nEven though I'm sending them the logo in vector format, with the font outlined, I often get back proofs where they reset the type into whatever looks most similar to them.\n\nHow can I avoid this? What's the correct explanation to give to make sure they reproduce the logo exactly, and not try to mimic it? It seems obvious to me (after all, they wouldn't try to mimic an image-based logo, would they?), but this happens so often, that I must not be explaining it well.\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n",

Sometimes you need to investigate a bit  \nmore than just sending a vector file.\n\nDifferent processes require different files.  \nSome stitching companies prefer a tiff file  \nto a vector file, because the software used  \nfor stitching patterns works with pixel-based images.  \nBut by saying that, an other stitching company  \nmight be fine with your vector art.\n\nring and investigate...\n\n"

Maybe it would be even easier for them to type only one letter and change the font.\n\nOf course, it may work only if your logo is supposed to be black and white. Otherwise, you may obtain the right logo, but wrong colors.\n\n"

The software I use for a vinyl cutting plotter, for example, requires I downsample vector files to Illustrator 8 format for them to work properly. Other devices may have different needs, so press as hard as you can on the issue of file format compatibility, including version numbers where applicable. Ask them what software they use in their shop, again, down to version number and OS.\n\n"
