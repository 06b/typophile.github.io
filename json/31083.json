These are Letraset sheets dated 1986 and the name of the face at bottom is Waldorf, designed by Freda Sack. Is this face in existence in digital format, maybe under a new name? Is it a revival of an earlier design? If so, from where and whom? Thanks for any info in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Waldorf.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070402063825/http:/typophile.com/files/Waldorf.jpg) | 190.01 KB |\n\n",
