  "content": "Hi,   \n   \nI'm actually working on a 3D font. But it seems that it work best when using midtones instead of B&W only, I'm struggling to find a solution to it. Has anybody think of a method of using images as fonts instead of having to convert everything into vectors.   \n   \nTilou\n\n",

      "content": "Another solution, used by Dennis Ortiz-Lopez and others, is to create several fonts that can be layered, one on top of the other. The base font would be the letter shape itself (in solid B&W form). The next font would be, say, a bevel effect, also in solid B&W form, which would be printed in a greyscale or any color determined by the user of the font. Another font could be an outline layer, an inline layer, etc.   \n   \nOrtiz-Lopez' work can be seen at:   \n   \n [http://ortiz-lopez.com/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020201736/http:/ortiz-lopez.com/index.html)   \n   \nDavid\n\n"

I can't say i am too hot on the technology side of these though - perhaps you can get some useful info by downloading the manual for it?   \n   \nEnjoy ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020201736im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
