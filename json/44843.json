  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m working on a typeface research project for school, where we have to design a poster that encapsulates the nature and personality of the typeface. I’ve chosen Frederic Goudy’s Hadriano. I’m looking for a photograph of the original stone tablet he took a rubbing from in the Louve for inspiration. Does anyone have any idea where I could find this? Better yet, a photo of the tablet in question? It would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you so much!  \nSarah\n\n [‹ TypeCon 2008 -\\> Pre & Post](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905090824/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44711 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(Huburt Jocham) A hard man to pin down ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905090824/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44836 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
