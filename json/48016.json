In fog, that point is now active, and I can edit it directly.\n\n3. For some reason Flab seems to like to have a different point be active. Why?\n\n4. The tools toolbar seems to disappear at random. Why?\n\n5. In another thread, Nick Shinn I think indicated that Flab is very difficult to work with unless you are sitting six inches away from the screen. Most of us are working on high-res screens nowadays, but Flab seems to be designed -- still -- for use at 800x600.\n\nWe need to sit 18-36 inches away from our screens. The further, the better for us. It's time for everything in Flab to be visible from that distance on a 17\" 1920x1200 monitor. Otherwise it's too much of an ergonomic liability.\n\n",

I find that changing many of the default colors helps, but I feel like I’m going to go blind staring at Fontlab!\n\nedit:  \nOn that note, the default colors for masks and components—among other things—are too similar. I often find that the colors in Fontlab are just too light all around, and that the software is easier to use when I crank up the colors and turn off whatever layers I’m not currently working with.\n\n"

Fontlab saves the new file in the last directory any file was saved to. I do a lot of incremental saves, and I can’t tell you how often I’ve ended up with a file in the wrong place because I’m used to “save as” working differently in almost every other app.\n\n"

I hadn't realized until you wrote just how difficult I find the points and most especially the handles to see.\n\nI'd also like more than one background layer. Let's say, numbered layers up to ten? (I can't imagine using more than three or four but you never know.)\n\nAnd now that basic 1990 MM support is almost perfect, let's go through hell for a few years by making it more advanced? Erik van Blokland predicted that Superpolator would be somehow included in Fontlab the minute he released it, and he doubled his chances of this happening by refusing to license it to Fontlab, where it belongs. I'm sure we all hope that Yuri is busily figuring all this out. Let's actualize Erik's paranoia. It'll be fun! And then it won't be paranoia anymore -- we can pronounce the patient cured!\n\nJames, regarding the perils of Flab save as, another problem is that if you lose track of the folder you did happen to save a file into, it can be very difficult to learn from Fontlab where that folder is, especially if the path is long.\n\n"

Fontlab complains about this in generate options -- that it's an open contour it cannot be exported as open.\n\nWhat's the best practice today?

I just want to have two extremes open and create a variation that a designer has requested.\n\nI'm afraid to create a new MM (or use the existing one) because how do I know -- if 'blend' doesn't work -- that Fontlab's export of an instance will work?\n\nIn this limited situation, what's the best thing to do? I could of course do it in Fog, and know exactly what was going to happen. But then I would lose my limited OT feature set which I'd rather not subsequently rebuild.
