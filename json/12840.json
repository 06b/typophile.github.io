  "content": "Hello first topic here,\n\nI'm looking for a serif or sansserif font for a English/Russian book, I'm going to design. Any ideas of high quality independant foundries providing these.  \nI thought about the Fedra Pro from Peter Biľak of the Fedra Serif A?  \nAny other ideas?\n\nMany thanks for your help,\n\nNicolas\n\n",

      "content": "ok,\n\nSorry for being not precise enough.  \nIndependant means like: LucasFont, Processtype, PsyOps or others.  \nI want to invest money directly to the designer who made the font not to big corporation like Adobe, Agfa…  \nGood quality means: wide character sets (thin, light, italic, medium, bold), fine tuning in the characters approaches already made, linear and non linear numbers…  \nI'm not sure yet what to use; serif or sansserif.  \nThe book is a world fair art catalogue. It's not highly contemporary but if I'm buying a complete font for this work, I'm planning to use the font for other upcoming works too.  \nI was intentionally \"vague\". I wanted to have a good Roman AND Cyrillic font list first and then affine the choice later on.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nNicolas\n\n"

I personally wouldn't choose it for long texts(I wouldn't choose any sans for long texts but that's just me), but if this is a catalog, i'm assuming the texts are short and this might just fit the bill.\n\n"

      "content": "I admire House Industries for a lot of things: their fantastic sense of style; their great taste; their innovative approach to type design (e.g., in Ed Interlock); the great usability and beauty of their latest release, Paperback; but _not_ for their Cyrillics. Chalet Cyrillic does not feel authentic (and yes, you can read it). You can compare the feeling to those Latin glyphs that are routinely included in the Japanese fonts: they look _foreign_. If you want real quality and authenticity, ParaType Cyrillics are your best bet.\n\n"
