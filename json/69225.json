      "content": "James, I think he means that Century Gothic sets wider than Arial, and, therefore, would use more paper.\n\nI checked this out before talking to an NPR reporter about it last week. The difference is not as great as I would have thought. In many cases, I don't think it will make a difference in the number of pages printed, but occasionally, especially with longer emails or emails that nearly fill the last page, it might add a page. It would have to be a very long email to add more than one page.\n\nStill, I would be curious to know how much of the savings in ink will be lost in increased paper usage.\n\n"
