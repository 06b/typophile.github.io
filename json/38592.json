      "content": "I really like the collage feeling that you get with these. It does not seem so digitized like many of these kinds of projects end up looking like. I hate when these compositional paragraph studies seem forced or contrived; but be careful with the imagery that is used. Make sure that your images/pictures are not defining the piece and ask yourself if you can achieve the same ideas with just text. Great work on the duo tone images, might want to play around with that motif.\n\nAlso, I am not sure if you are familiar with [David Carson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091121/http:/www.davidcarsondesign.com/)\n\n"

      "content": "It's getting somewhere. Perusing the David Carson books a few times over could really help. Your blocks of body copy really flatten the piece ... break it up with some more hierarchy. Look at some existing magazines and figure out how they're able to do that and then take it to your postmodern level! Lookin' good just needs a push.\n\n"
