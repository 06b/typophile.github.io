I can't find any suggestions about this in my book of the day, Penguin's <cite>Guide to Punctuation</cite>.\n\nI guess with quotes longer than a paragraph we might forget that what we're reading is a quote, so they put in the opening quote to remind us. And perhaps they don't close them because the quote isn't finished. It's always been something I've noticed too.\n\n"
