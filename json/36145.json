Pat’s brother, Mike, designed the album cover and chose the face so I am not sure where he got it from. But check out Adobe and Veer - might be from one of those.”\n\nI can’t find anything called Stillness.\n\nThe original cover art was done by Mike Carney who happens to be the drummer’s brother.\n\n"

I think you’ll find a font or 2 that are close. Also, [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/burin-sans/](http://web.archive.org/web/20071020195511/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/burin-sans/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/burin-sans/\") is nice and light and though the K, S and E are off it’s still pretty close.\n\n"
