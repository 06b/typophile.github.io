It’s a shame there isn’t a weight between regular and black though.\n\nMartin - another hint for designing this logo: take a look at how Jon set the text. “SØLUND” is not quite as wide as “TØMRERFIRMAET” because of the way the space under the ’T’ looks. You’ll probably need to do that regardless of what font you use.\n\n- Lex\n\nP.S. to Hrant - I’m not a fan of Arial’s ’R’ or Helvetica’s, but if I had to choose one, I’d go with Smellvetica.\n\n"
