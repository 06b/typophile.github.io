  "content": "I'm preparing this typeface based on the 'architectural' handwriting of a good friend.\n\nThe idea is that it should resemble the handwriting used for marks on architectural drawings and things of the sort.\n\nIn the first place it will be bilingual (english and greek monotonic), and soon it will, hopefully, be \"equipped\" with polytonic support and german language support.\n\nYour comments/critique are more than welcomed. =)\n\n[http://utopia.duth.gr/~vkarageo/architectural.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419054329/http:/utopia.duth.gr/~vkarageo/architectural.jpg \"http://utopia.duth.gr/~vkarageo/architectural.jpg\")\n\n",
