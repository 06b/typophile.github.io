  "content": "I work on a Mac platform but I need help from production artists who work on PCs. I would like them to be able to remove my fonts when they are done with my projects. I had one gal download the 30day Suitcase trial but it crashed. I am not a PC person so I can't trouble shoot for her. I use it and it works fine on the Mac. I thought maybe there is a way to temporarily install fonts on a PC. Maybe an alias font folder that can be placed in the font folder? Any ideas? I don't want her to keep adding more fonts to her system because she is bogged down already.\n\n",
