We hope to finish a final font around the end of May. Each friday, I post online couple of comments and bunch of images reporting where they are now. Click on the efojalict image to access to the current stage. Or start with that first one:   \n [http://perso.ensad.fr/%7eensadtypo/travaux/cookerblack.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019074311/http:/perso.ensad.fr/%7eensadtypo/travaux/cookerblack.html)   \n   \nDespite its in French, English comments are welcome via the \"commentez\" link.   \n   \n [http://erik.letterror.com/cgi-python/tm/cooker](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019074311/http:/erik.letterror.com/cgi-python/tm/cooker)   \nThe subject started his life with the Erik van Blokland TypeCooker (thanks to this list for the announce of it), so, naturally the working name was Cooker Black.\n\n",

You either have to learn how to \"Hint\" your fonts (an extra step in font design where you add \"guidelines\" for low-resolution rendering to look better), or turn on anti-aliasing for all sizes and live with the resultant blurriness.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I can see that although my French is really bad. I started sketching on 29-02-04 on a font with the same inner form like yours. Nice to see that a good idea is braught to paper. ;-) I will be watching your updates. Keep them coming.   \n   \nLater,\n\n"
