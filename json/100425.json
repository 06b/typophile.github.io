It comes with wide-ranging language support and decorative ligatures, and is now available on MyFonts at a 51% introductory rebate. :)\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/octant/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020106/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/octant/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/octant/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020106im_/http:/typophile.com/files/poster_promo_3852.png)\n\nBy the way, I'm new to selling fonts — what does one do to promote a new font, apart from what MyFonts does on their own? Any key fora, newsletters, platforms, etc that one should send a note to?\n\n",

Something like \"Octant released @MyFonts 51% off for a limited time.\" And link to it. MyFonts might retweet you, and they have loads of followers. You could even ask them to announce you to Twitter. I'm sure they wouldn't mind.\n\n"

But steampunk is an awfully narrow genre; I'm wondering whether I dug myself into a hole by marketing Octant as such... For instance, I could well see it on the cover of a crime/thriller/suspense novel, a bit like FF Disturbance was used for Schätzing's [Der Schwarm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020106/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.fontfont.com/staticcontent/inuseimages/original/FF_Disturbance-Frank_Schaetzing_The_Swarm.png%3F1311883329).\n\nThink there's a way one could increase the exposure of people in the print industry to the existence of Octant...?\n\nBy the way, my admin page says:  \nStarlets Rank: 51  \nHotNewFonts Rank: 68  \nAm I correct in assuming that once the HotNewFonts Rank drops below 50, it'll appear on the Hot New Fonts webpage and periodically show up as a flag on the MyFonts homepage?\n\n"
