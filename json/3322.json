Yes it's true that we do sell fonts, but all the font developers have given us permission to include them on to the CD. I have written emails from all of them filed away.   \n   \nI just spoke with Tom Murphy from Tom's Fonts(Since he was listed on this page) and he is now clear on the issue since he did give me permission, just like all the other font developers did.   \n   \nThere is no way I would include any fonts from any developers without getting permission.   \n   \nIf anyone needs to see the \"permission\", I will gladly provide it.   \n   \nthanks   \nmacXware\n\n"
