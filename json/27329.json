  "content": "One of my friends comissioned me to make a logo for his organic food imports company. Basically the idea is that its a combination of organics and nicaragua, so it's called Organíca. Innitially he wanted me to do something that looked like OrgaNica or orgaNICA to make the distinction between the terms clear, but i got him away from that style of blunt information. So this is what i've come up with so far. Im not sure how i feel about it and im not sure if i like the two colored leaves or just one. Any feedback would be much appreciated\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [organica.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109211446/http:/typophile.com/files/organica.jpg) | 75.65 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Also i forgot to point out, in the top one the text is slightly heavier than the other three. I thought the text overall looked a little too heavy compared to the leaves (if you stand back you'll see it), but I couldnt think of a better way to fix that. Im not totally happy with the thinned out text on the lower ones, i dont think its thin enough to balance, but if i thin it more it looks worse. I couldnt think of a good way to make the leaves bolder.\n\n"

      "content": "Personally, I'd go with the first option. The double leaves sort of wrap around each other, giving a feeling of warmth and trust, while a single lonely leaf is just that, a single lonely leaf. Also, in my opinion, having the leaves next to the name makes it feel a bit tacked on, almost as an afterthought, while putting them on top of the 'i' makes them feel a bit more integrated. The difference isn't that great, and there is something to be said for having it on the same line as the text. There's something about the leaf design itself that puts me off a bit, though. Maybe you could look at some other leaf shapes to see if you can find some other forms that work well.\n\n"

      "content": "hm. Yeah pretty much everyone has been telling me the two leaves, and i think i agree with you on that. As for the right side or on top, I was sort of worried that on top of the I it looked like a logo that i'd seen too many times before.... maybe im screwed either way on that though. I've been trying to fix the leaf with other shapes. one friend suggested turning it into a curved leaf, like one folded over on itself, but it didnt look right, and started to need too many colors for my liking.. also it wouldnt fit with there being two leaves now.. but ill keep experimenting with more involved leaf shapes\n\n"

Number one is also my preference.\n\nHowever, I think that if there's one thing here that can be improved, it's the choice of typeface. I find this face very \"inorganic\" -- no modulation, no torque, too \"mathematical\". I think the face should feel natural, and this one feels artificial to me.\n\nHere's a _very_ quick rework using Cronos. This is just to try and make my point; I'm not suggesting you use Cronos.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109211446im_/http:/typophile.com/files/organica_6291.png)\n\n"
