To win, you need to name both the typeface and the weight.\n- Show off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.\n- The winner produces a new challenge -- a complete glyph, black on white background, presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.\n- The person who posts a challenge can't win the next game.\n\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.\n\nIf you think this is a little too difficult, maybe try the [Entry Level Type ID Pop Quiz](http://web.archive.org/web/20110303034221/http:/typophile.com/node/31362) first. Too easy? Go to the [Expert Level Type ID Pop Quiz](http://web.archive.org/web/20110303034221/http:/typophile.com/node/31364).\n\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\n\n_With respectful thanks to the originator of this utterly useless but highly entertaining waste of time, the often imitated but never duplicated Cheshire Dave._\n\n",

Farao Book works surprisingly well for text, I used recently & was very pleased with the results. I gave it a short review as well for our national design magazine (this is the unproofed version)\n\n----------------------  \nFARAO  \n----------------------\n\nTo classify Farao merely as a ‘slab-serif’ is akin to describing Twin Peaks as a mere ‘drama’: the closer you look at it the weirder it gets. It is true that Farao has slab-serifs, but looking at the individual details reveals the eccentricities of certain letterforms, strange constructions that challenge one’s notion of how a letterform should be ‘correctly’ formed.\n\nIf the ‘g’, for instance, was a person then it would’ve been locked away at birth. The ‘c’ contradicts the vertical stress of the ‘o’ and differs entirely the pointed stroke finish of the ‘e’. The slabs of the ‘s’ bully the rest of it’s curves into submission, giving the appearance of a contorted snake about to strike. Farao’s uppercase isn’t quite as deranged as the lowercase—the inherited straightjacket of majuscule limits overly affected construction. The numerals, however, flaunt the familial oddness beautifully—slab-serifs and ball terminals are held together with excellent curves.\n\nUp close, Farao is certainly odd, but the individual inconsistencies make it perversely consistent as a whole. It is a warm, full-bodied family with a palatable coal-fired heft. Designed by František Štorm, it is available in a confusing array of styles. This is fortunately allayed by the very reasonable price and OpenType compatibility.\n\nFarao can be purchased from [www.stormtype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110303034221/http:/www.stormtype.com/ \"www.stormtype.com\")\n\n----------------------\n\n"

      "content": "Parry grotesque normal or semi-bold\n\nfrom Ourtype:\n\n<cite>Parry is a typeface design of Artur Schmal. It began as Schmal's graduation project at Type &amp; Media in The Hague. Inspired by the sturdy typefaces of Edmund Fry and Thorowhood, it came out as a rather traditional, heavy slab serif, complemented by an even heavier condensed variant and a series of sanserif capitals.</cite>\n\nAs of 2004 the typeface saw further development: First, designing the slab serif that would be suitable for composing longer texts yet retaining the Victorian atmosphere. Secondly, drawing a matching Grotesque, as part of the same family.\n\nDespite its nineteenth-century perfume, Parry is a contemporary type family. It produces a rounder and softer image than the often rigid slab serifs of those times. Some of Parry's design features - like the top serifs - have an outward bulge. And, although such details might be regarded as 'not done', Schmal opted for them, because 'it simply looks good' in combination with sharp-edged bottom of the lowercase c, e and d.\n\nParry Grotesque family comes in four weights: Normal, Bold, Semi-bold and Black and comprises matching Italics, Small Caps, as well as text figures.\n\nAvailable in Open Type Standard, TrueType and PostScript for Mac and PC. OpenType Pro is scheduled for release in Spring 2007.\n\n"
