We try to help folks here, not pounce on them for honest questions.   \n   \nAn italic like [Berkeley Old Style](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124723/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-berkeley-old-style/itc-berkeley-oldstyle-book-italic/testdrive.html?s=North%2BSea&p=48) is a bit neater, but has some of the same feel, perhaps. You might also find some hand-drawn fonts that could come close enough. Check Part 6, Part 8 or Part 11 of the [Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124723/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html) for possibilties.\n\n",
