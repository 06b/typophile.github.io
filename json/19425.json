  "content": "it occurred to me today as i was furthering my quest on understanding the history of type design, that it would be fun to be able to take typographical \"tests\"... since i never had a chance to take any classes dedicated solely to typography, i think it'd be a great way to learn more about identifying typefaces as well as better understanding the history and technique of it all.\n\nwould any of you be willing to put such a thing together?? does something like this exist?? i just feel like i'd really understand everything a lot better if i constantly was working on identifying things like this.\n\njust a simple kind of quiz or test with examples of fonts from specific movements, or asking to identify a face by its name, maybe stuff on kerning, spacing, etc etc\n\nor is this idea retarded :(\n\n",
