The signature of this typeface is the ear on the 'g'. Scangraphic has a history of changing names on their typefaces if they do not have the rights to use the 'correct' name. This is much like Bitstream's and URW's agreements with the foundries whose libraries they helped digitize.\n\nThe original name of this typeface, I still believe, is 'Textype' and it was designed by C. H. Griffith for Mergenthaler Linotype in 1929, as a newspaper type (See McGrew pp306-7)  \n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "I've done some more reading in McGrew and it seems that Griffith also designed a typeface called Excelsior for Linotype two years after Textype. Excelsior had a greater x-height, and in the metal version, came with either long or short descenders. Otherwise it's almost impossible (for me) to tell them apart. They both have the same ear on the 'g'. It makes sense to me that 'Esquire' is the digitization of 'Excelsior', since most of the time Scangraphic used the same initial letter as the original typeface name.\n\nFurther, this one may have fooled the FontBook folks too, because they show 'Esquire' as based on the 1929 Griffith design (Textype), when Excelsior was designed in 1931. BTW, Linotype has its own digital version of [Excelsior](http://web.archive.org/web/20110320055526/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/excelsior/). Does that match any better?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
