This is as clear as I can make the letters. I had more success with Galan than Tadhana, which has a dark background, which accounts for differences in the letters.  \nDoes anyone have any information on whether Survivor used an existing font?  \nIf there is not a known font, I would be interested to see any additional letters.  \nThanks.  \nDon\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Total Glyphic \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317131540/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
