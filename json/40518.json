I am no longer surprised at how often I find the answers to Techno font ID questions by setting the sample to the mystery font letters and then scrolling the selections looking for a match.\n\nIn the commercial world Identikal, Psy/Ops, and T-26 are some of the places I look first for 'Techno'. Ray Larabie's work bridges both worlds, as he has made many free fonts of this style, with polished up commercial versions.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
