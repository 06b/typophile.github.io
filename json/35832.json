I will definitely visit the Tschichold exhibition at the St. Bride Libray. Therefore I have one more question: Is it possible to visit the library and look through some old books or do I have to sign on.\n\ngreetings: Steven\n\n",

For further information:  \n [http://stbride.org/events\\_education/events/temporaryclosure](http://web.archive.org/web/20140406172439/http:/stbride.org/events_education/events/temporaryclosure \"http://stbride.org/events\\_education/events/temporaryclosure\")\n\nYou don't have to sign in at the library. However, in my experience it is best to contact the library first if you have a specific request. Most of the collection is tucked away, as apparently the reading room contains just 7% of their collection.\n\n"
