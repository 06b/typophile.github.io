The show always involves the band coming in the studio for a live 40 minute session.\n\nWell, they've always had Real Audio streams (which have had sub-par quality over the years) but they've recently made the show available as a [Podcast](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106071024/http:/phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=76016777) (Link requires iTunes).\n\nRecent bands include Clap Your Hands and Say Yeah and a gem out of Tijuana, called Nortec Collective. Yum.\n\n",
