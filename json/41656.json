With only your partial 2 and 7 to judge from, your typeface appears to be Steelplate Textura. This was digitiized by [Paul Lloyd](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203233939/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/blackjewels/index.htm) as Dampfplatz (A poor job. I mention it only because it offers shaded/inline fonts as well) and [Dieter Steffmann](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203233939/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/s/steelplate.htm) (a _much_ better version).\n\n"
