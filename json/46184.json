Blackletter, script, outline, dimensional and decorative styles were also available, but not used in this piece, which represents the basic \"look\" of advertising typography for much of the 19th century.\n\nSans serif faces came into common usage in the 1830s, but with the exception of the odd bold condensed display face, these were all-cap designs, and the idea and practice of using lower case sans serif fonts did not emerge until the 1890s.\n\nWhy did it take so long?\n\n",

It most likely looked so odd, that nobody immediately saw it for what it was. It really is more interesting that it's so close to helvetica and avenir, and other sans that are considered cutting-edge (gotham).\n\n"

And you have to narrow them more at the joins, like in a serif font, for them not to look clotted. But that compromises the mono-line look to some extent.\n\nThat doesn't answer the question of why they felt they needed a lower case, though.\n\n"

      "content": "For what it’s worth, this is my take on the topic. If, as I think, the sanserif letter of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was based first on Roman capitals of the Republican period – up to the first century BCE – which are monoline letters with hardly any noticeable serifs and no thick and thin strokes – and then on earlier Greek capitals, then our lower case letters did not exist at that period and it would have been illogical to add them to sanserif letters of any kind. During the 19th century, quite a lot of display typography using sanserif types, in books at any rate, seems, whether consciously or not, to have a sort of echo of the form of the Roman inscription, and is set all in caps.\n\nWhen typefounders began to think that the strange new ‘Egyptian’ (sanserif) design was worth developing (as we know it was already used by signwriters and letter cutters and lithographers and engravers), that argument did not hold out for very long. So you get Thorowgood’s well-known Grotesque round about 1830, which has condensed proportions and a lower case, and does not look remotely like the letters of a Roman or a Greek inscription. And then gradually lower case characters begin to be provided for some sanserif types. My impression is that these happen first, or at any rate more frequently, in Germany, round about 1850.\n\nBut of course anyone could have made a sanserif lower case. In 1810 William Gell published a book about his exploration of antiquities in Greece, and drew this quite nice title page for it using sanserif capitals. He would have been familiar with early Greek monoline inscriptional lettering.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628041224im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gell%20-%20Itinerary%201810%20-%201%20title%20tr%20a%20450_3689.jpg)\n\nAnd this is an engraving of a detail of one of the maps he drew for the book. The sanserif lower case must simply have seemed a sensible addition.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628041224im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gell%20-%20Itinerary%201810%20-%202%20lower%20case%20-%20500_4360.jpg)\n\nIf there is an earlier sanserif lower case in print than this, of 1810, I have yet to hear of it. (Note that I said in print. During the 18th century there were monoline types with a lower case for impressing lettering in relief for blind people to read.)\n\n"

The lower case is rather awkward. Is the story of greater use of lower case sans a matter of gradual improvement in the design of the lower case sans letters, which, when they were better, started to be used more often?\n\n"

The sans was so strange that it was not easy how to figure out a lower case for it – whereas the slab serifs, which just seemed to be rather crude roman types, soon had lower case in roman and italic.\n\nI dived into this without much preparation, but here to justify my remarks about the German sans is one from the foundry of F. W. Bauer in Frankfurt am Main (not, I think, any relation to Johann Christian Bauer, whose firm became the Bauer’sche Gießerei in Frankfurt), from the technical publication _Journal für Buchdruckerkunst_, 1858. The size is 14 Didot points. Seems pretty competent to me.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628041224im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bauer%20-%20Mittel%20Grotesk%20-%201858%20-%20500_4102.jpg)\n\nEnglish founders do seem to have woken up to the idea much later. Here is a sans from the Caslon foundry in London, from their house journal, _The Caslon Circular_ for October 1878. The size is 2-line English or about 28 point. They introduce it with the note, ‘Many have been the applications we have received for the Doric—or Sans-serif— lowercase, and we have been induced to commence the series so as to supply the want thus indicated.’ In other words we are making a lower case for this font because our customers keep asking for it, not because we want to. They say, without enthusiasm, that it has ‘the quality of plainness’, and that it can’t help being ‘a good wearing letter’. What one might call low-key marketing.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628041224im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Caslon%20-%20Doric%202E%20lowercase%20-%20500_3846.jpg)\n\nMore early German examples would be welcome – but not that notorious and much-reproduced condensed sans of ‘1825’, which I hope is now thoroughly discredited.\n\n"

But why did the marketers not respond to the market's \"applications\" for a sans lower case? Because it was beneath the diginity of type founders?--They were men of rank, many being engaged in public affairs. James Figgins I, for instance, was an Alderman while directing the Figgins foundry, only retiring from the business when he became an MP in 1868.\n\n"

I'm wondering whether this was a German practice, based on the black letter style of g.\n\nPerhaps the one story g is easier to make work in a monoline look, as you have three horigonals, instead of the four in the double story g.\n\nAnd the need for a more forced double story g may have influenced the more quirky look of the English Grotesques. That German 'Mittel Grotesque' already has a more even, sober look than the English example.\n\n"
