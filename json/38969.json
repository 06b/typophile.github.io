  "content": "Hello,  \nI am looking for Latin typefaces that incorporate appropriated forms initially found in ethnic/indigenous contexts (er, pardon that clumsy terminology?).  \nAn example I was recently introduced to is the Churchward “Maori” face (thanks to David Bennewith at the Jan van Eyck Academie). Someone also mentioned a face based on Basque carvings.  \nEssentially I am looking to start a project that explores the ways type designers employ these sorts of forms (consciously or intuitively?) and what the implications of this could be in a larger context? Any literature on the subject or leads on specific faces or designers would be much appreciated.  \nThanks v much\n\n [‹ 2008 Campaign logos update: McCain TV designers tweak logo.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203115115/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39043 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [History of lower-case letterforms: book ideas? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203115115/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39024 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

There are also a number of faux-Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese/Japanese, Sanskrit, etc. types that have been mentioned on Typophile. Try searching Typophile on Google (limit the search to just Typophile.com in Advanced Search) for these topics; they shouldn’t be too hard to find.\n\nAside from these typefaces that incorporate “appropriated forms,” there are a number of types that are sympathetic to non-Western scripts. A number of the typefaces coming out of the University of Reading start with the idea of mating a Roman type with another alphabet/script. See the newest ones here; see Skolar and Vesper of the new ones, and look at some past PDFs for other examples.\n\nFinally, an interesting article that may be applicable is [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203115115/http:/www.studio-gs.com/neuland.html) about the stereotypes that typefaces come to embody.\n\nThis looks like a really interesting project: I’ll look forward to see what you produce.\n\n"

      "content": "My Nyala typeface for Microsoft might be of interest. In this case, the design of the Latin was intended to harmonise visually with the traditional Ethiopic Ge‘ez script: it is an Ethiopic typeface that supports Latin text, rather than a bi-script design. This being the case, I felt I had some freedom in interpreting some of the lesser-used punctuation characters like the dagger, bullet, curly braces, etc. The dagger, for instance, is based on the hilt design of an Ethiopian sword I saw, while the bullet and the cross ornament are based on traditional Ethiopian patterns.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203115115im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/nyalapunc_4345.gif)\n\n"
