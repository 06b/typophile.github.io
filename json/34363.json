But I don't read it very much so my opinion is only worth just so much.

(If true this would be a good reason or an endorsement )\n\n- It might be that a lowered x-height ish alignment has a better 'cue value'.

Sometimes it's a great idea to break a rule. Not often. The only way to know is to look; and then weigh the consequences for yourself.\n\nSo it could be that those with the H height are being somehow culturally insensitive or something but - I can't quite sign up for that because I am not utterly sold on the idea that there is a 'convention' yet. Partly I get this from looking around the font universe.\n\nLooking at News Gothic the Bitstream version uses the H height. The Linotype NewsGothic uses the x. These seem to be true house-wide ( mostly ). Freight uses the H. Bello, & Feijoa the x. Tiptoe & Omnes the H. Amalia, & Fedra the x. Parry & Sansa Slab the H. Candy Script ( and all of Ale Paul's others) use the x more or less. Eduardo's fonts ( emtype ) all seem to use the x.\n\nIt also seems to me that the heavier the face is, and the more geared to display work the face is, the more an H height alignment seems reasonable. The spirit of the type might suggest what is right too. A slab Egyptian or a modernist face 's 'raison d'être' might be most compatible with an H height aligned '¿'.\n\nStill, Ricardo, thanks for posting the link to Malena. And your example is exactly the kind of thing that looks pleasant/natural to my foreign eyes; naive as they are.\n\nI also agree that hearing from further from Ricardo, Ale Paul, Eduardo Manso, & Miguel Hernández would be far more useful than the meagre theory & observations I have offered.\n\nStill, since that's all I have I will go on a little further.\n\nIt seems to me that the design of the ¡ ¿ ? & ! probably aught to be done differently if you intend a heavy Spanish/Catalan use. In addition to certain alignments being easier to kern for; or looking better; ( or insert your concern here )- certain forms probably work better when they are spun around than others. Maybe softer hooks? Does anybody create a different shape for their '¿' vs. '?' ? It seems like that might be a very good idea as well. I should check to see if that is already being done actually... Maybe these are silly ideas. What do you all think? Any examples?\n\n"

I would guess that, in these cases, the position of the questiondown is more a matter of the typeface/font design, than any typesetting convention. Presumably, however, Adobe and Slimbach did some surveying and gave some consideration to the standards that they've adopted for their Originals series. And, presumably, the designers of these books gave some consideration to what the questiondown looked like before settling on Adobe Garamond. (Or not.)\n\nWhat these examples do show is that the x-aligned questiondown does not violate any general cultural acceptance.\n\nThe best perspective, however, will still be provided by a native Spanish-speaking typographer or type designer who is steeped in his/her own tradition.\n\nI would hypothesize that historically (meaning handset metal) the questiondown was originally just an inverted question mark, and so it's position relative to the baseline would depend upon the proportions of the font at hand. (Similarly, the earliest opening quote was an inverted comma, and so the alignment of opening quotation marks sometimes varied from that of closing quotes/apostrophes.)\n\nRelatively longer descenders (like in a Garamond) would yield a top alignment closer to the x-height. Relatively shorter descenders would yield a questiondown that aligns higher.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

While I was working in Buenos Aires during the 90s, there was a pretty big economic recession in progress, and I know that most book publishers could not afford to spend a lot of money on cover design and illustration... I doubt that they would have been able to invest in many typefaces, either... (I could be very wrong about this, though.

After all, it's against this background understanding of the implicit \"big\" grammatical structure -- which can extend to long sentences with many subordinate clauses -- that punctuation marks and page layouts have meaning. Emphases (parentheses, italics, bold) must also be read in this way, with a remembrance/anticipation of text outside immediate focus and attention.\n\n"

You are right - it's more complicated.\n\nKarsten said <cite> it shows that the positioning was chosen intentionally</cite> I feel slightly uneasy cleanly extrapolating from handmade comic lettering to text or even to display in type. That said, I think there is plenty to learn from handmade comic lettering, not least in this case. So I agree - mostly.\n\nMiguel, thanks for checking in!\n\nThe thing that strikes me most about 1-5 is that it looks to my eye like it would be possible to design agreeable versions of both Cap aligned & x aligned question & exam marks. If I have time I will try to show what I mean.\n\n<cite>The exclams’ spacing too should be contextual</cite> Of course I think it should all be contextual.... but that's a side issue.\n\nEven though this thread has been interesting, I don't think my mind has been changed - just shifted. It seems valid to me to do either thing, but in general and for text especially I will favor Richard & Miguel's preference. As far as Nicks CAP examples. I think 3,4& 5 all look okay to me. 1 & 2 do not. But As I said, I think that's a function of the design of the faces used nearly as much as it is a function of what tends to look/feel best.\n\nThe ¡YO NO FUI! example is nice because It's a great example of where a Modern sensibility seems to be better served or at least is more consistent with the H align model.\n\n"

Legal and government documents with their hierarchy of numbered paragraphs and sub-sections (and the Bible) are texts where page-context is important in reading. I'm guessing that not all saccadic scans follow the bouncing ball, and a brief internet search of scientific literature reveals that the \"foraging\" nature of saccadic eye movements has been documented.\n\nThe presence of an opening question/exclamation mark in some languages and not others suggests the complexity of the issue. How is it that English readers are able to start reading a long question with the final mark well in the distance? Are there sufficient grammatical cues in the opening words, or do we \"catch\" the question mark in \"the corner of the eye\" in a foraging saccade?\n\n"

This is in fact why opening question marks are so useful. I wouldn't mind seeing them ported over to English! Or even better, do what Armenian does: allow question marks directly on the vowel(s) in question, so to speak. :-)\n\nOn the other hand, a reader can -and does- go in and out of immersion,  \nso there certainly can/should not be such a thing as a \"pure\" text face.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Spanish structure is less explicit and benefits from leading punctuation. English tends to put big honking clues at the beginning of sentences that are questions. Generally in English you invert the order of the statement and that signals a question. Spanish, not as much.\n\n"
