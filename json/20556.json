Also what alternatives for the (free) font used for the logo?\n\nOr does anyone have any good examples of ads that don't look like they are striaght from the yellow pages?

      "content": "I would rethink the layout rather than just the typeface. Most ads follow this hierarchy: 1. Headline 2. Visual 3. Body Text 4. Logo/Contact Info. 1 and 2 are sometimes switched, especially if you have a great visual (photo or illustration). Right now everything has about the same visual weight which is making everything blend together. Increase the size of the headline, eliminate the wide margins, put the logo and contact info at the bottom and see what that does.\n\n"

Color and type are only parts of the whole.\n\nBTW -- I used to do small space B&W ads for newspapers and yellow pages by the hundreds many years ago (and still will for beer money ;-\\> ).\n\nMy key question would be \"what kind of clientele are you after?\"  \nYour ad, since you design interiors, will be a direct reflection of your own style or the style that appeals to your potential clients.\n\n"

So i just threw this one togethar to get type help.\n\nThe clients for this one will be a more wealthy crowd as this is going in a black and white gala brochure where tickets are anywhere from $150-$10,000. So something elegant and classy i suppose.\n\nThoughts?\n\n"

Not to bog down on the words, but the slogan or tag line or whatever you want to call it at the top is a lost opportunity. It leads me to wonder, \"if I hired them to do my whole house, would they still work one room at a time?\" I don't see what the idea is selling.\n\nNow that I made a mess of that, if I didn't have the resources to develop a meaningful headline-style campaign, I would enlarge the logo to nearly fill the space, line list the bits at the bottom, make the number big but submissive (as you have it), and think twice about the pic (which may turn out rather unflattering considering the print quality).\n\n"

      "content": "I think you should try the headline on two or three lines and visibly larger than the bullet points. The rules under the bullet points look as though they will fill in even on high quality brochure stock, they are also too close to the copy and don't perform any real function (although they are better than using a bullet), if their purpose is to separate each subject then do you need one for organization? I would also use the logo in the form it appears on the website (horizontal) as this allows the type to be larger as it is overwhelmed by the illustration at the moment. The contact information could also appear in one line. One of the reasons for this advice is that the mixed alignment/typefaces/size and leading of the elements are fighting one another.  \nI am not sure that the curtains really add to the design they seem more theatrical/horror movie than domestic and send out confusing messages; are we in a room looking out onto a foggy night; are we looking into a room from the outside?  \nMy inclination would be  \nHeadline enlarged split into three lines at top left possibly ranged right;  \nBullets, ranged left starting nearer the horizontal centre vertically aligned to below the headline;  \nContact Details in one line justified to the width of the horizontal logo bottom left, and  \nBackground black  \nThat's only a brief assessment and you might find it doesn't work for you, but I hope it is helpful.  \nTim\n\n"

As for font choice you need to keep that progression in mind, Trajan is a fine display face but needs to be bigger to work with your body copy wheras the contact details are overpowering the logo.  \nThinking further I don't think the last bullet point • Organization really means anything in the context of the advertisement, it is the kind of nebulous heading that needs supporting copy.  \nTim\n\n"

The logo should go above the contact info. Some of that type needs to be smaller and some of it should be bigger. You will create interest by creating a hierarchy of information, not when everything has the same visual weight to it. Right now you have 3 \"chunks\" of information that are relatively the same size/weight.\n\n"
