You'd find some good alternatives browsing fonts tagged ' [sketch](http://web.archive.org/web/20141201055447/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Asketch)' at MyFonts.  \nFor the ones on the left, sorry but can't recognize any. Could be either bespoke or freebies. Having also a look at MyFonts to fonts tagged ' [chalk](http://web.archive.org/web/20141201055447/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Achalk)' should be helpful. Google is also your friend. Some searches like ' [best+chalk+fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20141201055447/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%2526source%3Dhp%2526q%3Dbest%2Bchalk%2Bfonts)' should work perfectly. Many people have posted their best picks.\n\n"
