If we check out who's on the Advisory Board we see \" [Steve Russell](http://web.archive.org/web/20130915054353/http:/www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/board/russell.html), Chief People Officer, Senior VP, Human Resources, McDonald’s USA.\"\n\nIf we check out the Senior Partners, we see \" [McDonald’s USA](http://web.archive.org/web/20130915054353/http:/www.mcdonalds.com/usa.html)\" is third on the list.\n\nThe second authour, [Kimes](http://web.archive.org/web/20130915054353/http:/www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/facultybios/faculty.html?id=43), who is most likely [Yang's](http://web.archive.org/web/20130915054353/http:/www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/students/phd/phddetails.html?id=sy229) supervisor, has an impressive background. Note that [Walt Disney World Resorts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130915054353/http:/disneyworld.disney.go.com/) was a previous client of hers.\n\nThe three different menus (numbers with a $, numbers without, and numbers written in words) differed slightly in their design. Each used a different colour elastic binding so that the server could tell which was which. A possible confound. Overall, this looks like a pretty tight study. Well written, and seemly good stats, but I'm not that good at math (yet). Judging by the graphic design of the publication, someone has obviously spend a lot of time on it and are attempting appealing to corporate culture as well as academia.\n\nThanks for the link Sii. Research is fun!\n\n"
