Suggestions would have to include [Memima](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143521/http:/www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=TT010008X1M1&start=1) and [Little Days Alt](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143521/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/westwind/index.htm)   \n, which directly took its inspiration from Memima. Also, there's Kinema Moon's [ito](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143521/http:/www.kinemamoon.com/#).   \n   \nEdit: Oops, I thought it a little odd that this post wasn't responded to yet. You already covered Memima in the other post, Patricia.   \n   \n[Moderator edit] I moved Mike's post from the duplicate thread to this one.\n\n"
