  "content": "Hello fellow typophiles.\n\nI'd like to show my new release. It's a sans called Gesta.\n\nGesta is a friendly versatile sans serif typeface suitable for corporate and editorial purposes.  \nWith its generous x-height and slightly curved strokes, Gesta combines a distinctive and warm feel with a modern look.  \nIt is available in four weights from light to bold with four matching italics and its OpenType features include small caps and old style figures for every weight.\n\nit is available at MyFonts.
