There are thousands of sans that fit that description, but in the bolder weights the distinct personality of gill sans (with it's perfect circles and consistent stroke thickness) was hard to match. I ran across neuraface a few years and found it to share a very similar geometric sensibility as gill sans... just interpreted a little differently.  \ni think of neutraface as being gill sans slightly more eccentric sister.  \nit appeals to the same type of clients and projects that would call for gill sans, but the deco element adds a little vintage flair.\n\nhowever, you're right, it's not really what i would call a general workhorse typeface. i just like using it specifically as a gill alternative.\n\n"

And, you can tone it down if you license the entire opentype family by using the text versions with the alternates as opposed to the display versions. But, it isn't humanist it is definitely geometric.\n\nHowever, if you want something more humanist in a sans, and a little off the beaten humanist path, and still want that pungent aroma, check out [Anisette Petite](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110022623/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Anisette%20Petite) from [Porchez Typofonderie](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110022623/http:/www.typofonderie.com/)\n\nGoing down the unexpected grotesque aisle you could check out [Amplitude](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110022623/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Amplitude) from [Font Bureau](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110022623/http:/www.fontbureau.com/) which is rumored to be expanding its flavor (not) soon (enough).\n\nFF Bau from [Font Shop](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110022623/http:/www.fontshop.com/) recently gave birth to italics -- not obliques which seem to be more in keeping with grots -- thanks be to the day.\n\nAnd if you really do like Gill, but hate the little intrinsic quirks that make it annoying -- the lowercase t -- you really should look at Bliss from [Jeremy Tankard Typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110022623/http:/www.typography.net/).

Is that right?) putting the negative space of the stroke a priority over the stroke itself. As a result, the stroke is steeply tapered at points.  \ngill is more interested in keeping a steady, consistent stroke that, yes, tapers subtlety at joints but quickly restores the established width... in return it’s curves are soft and flabby compared to futura, but the stroke retains it's established thickness much more than futura.\n\nas it's 'geometric sans serif' classification implies, futura certainly has the look going for it, but for some reason i tend to associate the humanist sans, particularly gill sans, with a more mathematical perfection.\n\nthat's my story and i'm stickin' with it!\n\nreally though, does that make since? i'm curious. or is my untrained eye seeing 'perfect circles and consistent stroke thickness' in places where it doesn't exist?!\n\n"

They also came (by overuse) to represent the graphic vernacular of two entire nations; the mid-century joke was 'Q. How do you do British graphic design? A.Set it in Gill Sans and print it in racing green.'\n\nThey BOTH use optical adjustment to tweak the letterforms into appearing like they're monoline, but they follow radically different patterns of construction. Each idea has its strengths and weaknesses, which can be revealed by examinining the progression of heavier weights in the family - by the time you get to Gill Elefant or Futura Extra Bold, it should be apparent that neither of them is perfect.\n\n"
