And I agree with her – the two faces are startlingly close, but Daniel's date for the Monotype specimen pre-dates Steile Futura by at least a decade.\n\nAt last I have got off my arse and done something about it (outlines in progress below), but the question I want to ask now is _\"Is Monotype Condensa an (English) knock-off of the (German) Steile Futura Italic?\"_\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013005959im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Condensa_outlines_5483.jpg)\n\n",
