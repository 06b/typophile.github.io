You can always use the pre-drawn ones from the Letterhead fonts, but even with those it helps to maneuver the swashes around to achieve the best underlining. They need to be stretched for word lengths, and positioned for good connection. You don't just type them on, like any other font character.   \n   \nI'm not trying to be discouraging, but there are limits to what you can expect a font to do.\n\n"
