  "content": "a recent job solicitation on multiple forums triggered a little debate about forum cross-over, and it occurred to me (as a relative newbie) that the forum guidelines are pretty lax... i'm ok with that, as i enjoy browsing, but i do notice type ID queries in just about every forum as well as lots of design critiques and software questions outside of their appropriate categories. it seems that many folks simply default to \"general discussions\" for their posts.\n\ntwo questions :\n\ndo we collectively care enough to try and reinforce the categories ?\n\nand :\n\nwhat is the general policy toward job / project offers ?  \n( i don't see many here, and i don't come to typophile to find them - just wondering).\n\nalso : thanks in advance and perpetuity to moderators for their sisyphean efforts.\n\n",

The moderators are paying attention and we'll move the threads as we notice them.\n\nMost jobs that have nothing to do with type or typography are considered spam. These threads are removed. If, however, someone is posting saying they need a type designer and it is a humble enough request there is no reason not to leave it. Most of us can tell the difference.\n\n"

      "content": "There is simply no way to ensure posting will happen in the appropriate areas, not with the number of visitors Typophile sees, but as Tif said, part of what the moderators do is to move threads into other topic areas if necessary and keep everything tidy.\n\nThough we'd love to have the boards organized as efficiently as possible, there are no set rules that say software discussions must be kept within the Build section, or logo discussions under the umbrella of Critique. In coming months, we will be making some minor tweaks here and there, and part of that will hopefully assist users, especially newbies and first time visitors, in finding and posting to the appropriate sections. Type ID is certainly an area that needs this attention, and much of the issue is simply exposure. A significantly large % of visitors do not land on the \"Forum Topics\" page so they may not be aware that the option exists until after they have posted.\n\n"

I have always felt that the sub-forum \"Typography/Composition\" kind of gets buried there. I forget to look. I'd rather see that under Design.\n\n"

And even there it isn't appropriate.\n\nWe all need to try to read between the lines a little more or ask more questions to discover what is in between the lines. Assuming only causes problems. If you have a sincere question as to why someone posts something then ask the question. Don't make an assumption and post based on that. We, Typophile as a collective, can benefit from each other only if we allow for the collective to exist. Name-calling is one way to destroy that collective. It is human to disagree with someone's POV, but it is inhumane to debase that person only because you disagree and further not allow that person to have their own POV.\n\nWhen you participate in online discussions you agree to use common courtesy—which is common sense to do so. We've lost a few people because this doesn't always happen.\n\n"

The sages said \"Be judging every person in a favorable light.\" So the question is: What does that mean? So the story goes that a certain famous sage was seen going into a house of prostitution with a sack of money, staying for a half hour, and later emerging with a young woman, and without the money sack. \"How do you judge that in a favorable light?\" a sage asks his student. The student answers: this was a time of war, and his sister had been captured and sold into prostitution; he went to pay a ransom to rescue her before anything bad could happen to her. --And that was indeed the case, the story concludes.\n\nThings are not always what they seem, and our anger is easily aroused, at least if you are anything like me. I try to remember that story and smile--which also helps.\n\n"

For those of you who find the thorn the best thing to do in regards to that is ignore the thread.

How much time have they spent looking?\n\nMyself love to find a typeface research it out, while researching I find other interesting typefaces or topics.  \nHowever I am surprised and interested to see the 'helpers' of typeface recognition, their replies are well informed and very courteous even to the lame questions.\n\n@ William Berkson: “Be judging every person in a favorable light.” very nice\n\n"
