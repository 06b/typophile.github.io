      "content": "Good question. Easy answer is that it all depends on the type. It is interesting to see some actual text set that mixes ital and book etc. I like to see what the type designers intend as far as usage. Max size, minimum size, but also stretch the possibilities. Maybe a book face can work for headings up to a point, but what is that point where it begins to look to heavy or show too much. If you can show a face used well, and also hint at the limits of its use, that to me is very helpful.\n\nI also find the descriptive texts on Storm's pages to be very interesting.\n\nWhat a fun project.\n\n"

In this day and age, there are few printed specimens to be found.\n\nFor text faces, I like to see a column of text in the target text sizes as well as some semi-display usage. I also like to see some italic and bold mixed in to the text to see how it fits with the roman.  \nDisplay faces need more \"in use\" kinds of stuff. For ads show ads, For signage, show signs...  \nFor the character set, I would like to see at least one glyph showing with each diacritc. I mean if you show a u umlaut, you don't need to show every other umlaut used. I would also want to see a list of languages the font can be set in.  \nSometimes, when talking with a clent about type, I like to show them samples. This is where a good speciman can work as a sales tool. If I am trying to convince a client to purchase a font, it helps to have some really beautiful printed stuff to use as a way to visualize it.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Now that OpenType is upon us, it's no longer a simple matter to understand what a given charset offers: Pro might mean different things from different foundries.\n\nOpenType format doesn't guarantee the presence of any particular glyphs. Therefore, discuss/show what glyphs are included in the various formats offered.\n\nThat brings up a question: What formats to offer? If there's a huge glyph set and lots of features in the OT version, do people feel compelled to make all those glyphs available in separate fonts in the PS or TT versions? Or should we be pushing people toward OT by making them available only in OT fonts?\n\nI'm most informed by real-world uses of the various cuts. Show real text in the text weights, show signs, packaging, layouts in the display weights. House Industries recent United specimen shows packaging, magazine layouts, etc. and it's very useful to see the type integrated in its context.\n\nI hope Norbert will weigh in.\n\n"

Maybe it's because they are display oriented & I have been in a text mindset for the last 3 months...\n\nI really enjoyed seening the type in use. They eloquently show many things that the sample pages can't. On the sample pages the layouts where the text is presented larger on one line & then smaller underneath seem the most useful and attractive to me.\n\nThe quibble I have re: the smaple pages is that I would like there to be a bit more bounding space around the sample pages. I find that they have a slightly breathless quality because of their tight fit.\n\nTo me the most striking thing about seeing the catalog was that somehow the best qualities of James' fonts seem lend themselves especially to print. Conversely it seems like these same qualities are unfairly not nearly as apparent on screen.\n\nI wonder if this is because he is designing with print in mind to begin with, maybe it's the impact of his high rez proofing device, or perhaps it has to do with the fundamental nature of qualities in type that interest him.\n\nCertainly plenty of type I have seen on screen & then printed for a better look has ended up feeling a bit 'punchier' than I would like in print. Whereas it was that punchiness that made it seem interesting or lively on screen.\n\nDoes anybody else see what I mean or am I the only one?\n\nJames, what do you think?\n\n"

I do like putting a lot of subtle details in the designs that only reveal themselves in larger sizes, but that doesn't seem to interfere with their functioning in text applications.\n\nThe next catalog, due in September, will be very text oriented.\n\nAs to the tight space on the showings page, perhaps we could have been more generous with the white space in a larger format, but for this one breathless will have to do.\n\nJames\n\n"

Even my 600dpi laser (fake rezed to 1200) is only an indication. This matters more for small type certainly but even large type never gets the true crisp feeling that real 2400dpi delivers. That is why a good speciman sheet is so valuable. The hard part is that the expense of producing and shipping is so much more than just posting a PDF that most type vendors don't bother any more. I hate to talk about the old days but there was a time when my mailbox got filled with well printed samples of type. The downside was that there were far fewer faces and typesetting was quite costly compared with today's bargain prices.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Although to different degrees of course depending on the face. Clearly I overstated or oversimplified what I meant to say. While it is true that I probably wouldn't set a book in any of these faces - I would be more than pleased to set a magazine or article in one. So again to clarify I think what I was getting at is that there is a lively quality, and an optimism and a can-do feeling to all the faces (even in Rawlinson & Alfon) which in larger sizes is more apparent. These qualities attract my eye and makes me think 'Headline'.\n\nBut re-reading what you wrote makes me wonder. Are you at all interested in expanding these families into optically optimised versions as well or are you content to design for excellent cross-size compatibility? I also imagine that optical specific design might be reserved for custom work.\n\n<cite>... the lesser definition of the screen dilutes both specific letterform features and the character of the design. </cite>\n\nYes. I had already seen the ways in which screen oriented type was at a disadvantage in print before but recently I have been especially taken with the way that print oriented type can suffer from the screen.\n\nWhat it makes me realize is that for a foundry that is oriented to selling to the general public or to designers (rather than to custom type/print clients), it really does behoove them to bend to the screen, in part because the fonts will probably be seen there first before they are bought and in part because use in that context is pretty likely as well. But this also means that print oriented type might benefit from marketing that encourages/educates a prospective buyer to evaluate the font more relevant ways.\n\n<cite>I can never judge type on screen that is meant for print.</cite>\n\nYes. Clearly! And more & more Clearly.\n\nThank you, James. And if there is anything else you want to add. I am all ears!\n\n"

Most of the work I do I proof at text sizes for much of the development process, and I'm happy with the way it functions in bothe text and display sizes\n\nThe issue I have with optically-sized font families, is it is an awful lot of work for what looks to be a very small pay-off. Most type users are not as sophisticated as those here on typophile, and I have seen way too many examples of optically-sized type being used in the most outrageous ways. Does it make sense for a small type studio to spend that much development time on a range of products that most likely will not be used, or used incorrectly. I still don't have a good answer for that.\n\nOne of the last magazine jobs I did involved redesigning a title that was using Minion 72 as their text type (9.5/11). WHen I asked the art director why this was the case, she said her and her boss just loved the way Minion look in the samples they saw (display I;m sure) and decided to use it as the text face. It didn't bother them that it looked fragile and sparkled in a way that made it uncomfortable to read. They also had the habit of negatively tracking it as a way of killing widows.
