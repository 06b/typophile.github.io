Flange is close but it doesn't seem quite right to me. Nick Shinn's [Beaufort](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825164442/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/bold/testdrive.html?s=PAPPADEAUX&p=48) and Jim Parkinson's [Modesto](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825164442/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto/lite-regular/testdrive.html?s=PAPPADEAUX&p=48) are also similar. There is also an older font called Weiss Gothic that's similar, but it doesn't seem to be available in digital format.\n\n"
