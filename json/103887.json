      "content": "Rudolph Ruzicka designed Fairfield as a text font inspired by Venetian Old Face types over a ten year period starting in 1939. The medium weight, as shown in the sample image, was released in 1947. Alex Kaczun redesigned Fairfield for Linotype-Hell -- I believe he added the elegant flourished capital letters and the other alt letters -- which released it in digital form in 1992.  \nDon\n\n"
