  "content": "Hello guys, I'm writing to present my new font family called Bommer Slab.\n\nAbout the Project:  \nBommer project started in January of 2014 and I am happy to announce the first family - Bommer Slab - is now ready for release. This family includes 14 weights - been seven uprights and seven italics.\n\nThis font has a strong personality, that makes it perfect for use in headline sizes but means it also works gracefully within text blocks.\n\nBommer Slab is just the beginning: a rounded version will be launched next month (May 2014) and condensed and sans versions are estimated for the second semester of 2014.\n\nWebsite: [http://dootype.com/bommer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223911/http:/dootype.com/bommer \"http://dootype.com/bommer\")\n\nMyfonts: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dootype/bommer-slab/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223911/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dootype/bommer-slab/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dootype/bommer-slab/\")\n\nThanks!  \nEduilson Coan\n\n",
