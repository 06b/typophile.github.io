I realize this a bit strange but I thought perhaps someone here would know where I could find one. Most people I’ve talked to don’t know what Cooper Black is so I thought I’d ask here. I hope someone can help.\n\nCheers!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115033750im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/milkcarton2_5170.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115033750im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/pl_5448.jpg)\n\n [‹ A full set of supercript glyphs](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115033750/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31879 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tattoo/Tribal Vector Art ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115033750/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31853 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
