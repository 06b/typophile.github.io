  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI’m designing my resume, and have it all set in Whitney. It looks great, but a bit dry. I was hoping to set my name in a different font to add a little flavor, but can’t find a good pairing.\n\nAnyone have a good suggestion for a display font to pair with Whitney? My initials are S.H. so anything with nice versions of those letters would work well.\n\nThanks!  \nSam\n\n [‹ Sans-Serif with Sloop Script Three](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122113443/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48612 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Poster for client Pet Psychics Inc. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122113443/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48303 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
