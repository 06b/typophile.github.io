However, I agree it seems like the sort of thing SOMEONE would have digitized. The big problem is that very likely the name was changed. Jim Parkinson has a Sans Serif font called Richmond, and so does Linotype, although theirs is a Blackletter style. I only found one reference to Richmond Old Style and it was a reference to seeing it used for TV show titles. (perhaps more evidence that a font exists?)   \n   \nMaybe someone out there knows how much photocomposition is still being done?\n\n"
