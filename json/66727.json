  "content": "A new era of typographical challenges and oppurtunities knocks on the door. On iPad Eve I feel, as book designer, editor and typographer, much the same excitement that came with the introduction of quality paperbacks in the 1950s. Our book culture cannot without mediation just be republished in new media. All our typographical skills are needed to make the tablets function in a humane and literate way and thereby assist the survival of the book.\n\n",
