      "content": "Hrant,\n\nyou don't need any \"special\" software to make any kinds of fonts. You can always write the binary .ttf code by hand. It just takes a little bit of skill. FontFlasher or the FontLab Pixel tool (that comes with FontFlasher) does not directly support greyscale pixelfonts since some greyscale pixelfont creation techniques seem to be covered by U.S. patents and are therefore not available for general public. Also, the simulation of greyscale in pixelfonts differs depending on the rasterizer used.\n\nHowever, you can still use the Pixel tool for FontLab/FontLab Studio to create greyscale pixelfonts. You just need to specify a 2x or 3x or 4x finer grid in the tool, and then you can turn the \"subpixels\" on and off.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"
