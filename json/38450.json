A particular workstation with OS 9 brought me more headaches and discomfort than a thousand days of hangovers.\n\nOnce OS X arrived (along with some bugs which were ironed out) and the switch to Intel processors happened... well that's the point where I start to get misty-eyed.\n\n"

Once I realized that the OS lacked memory protection I just went to OS X full-time and never looked back. There were certainly glory days for the old Mac OS, but I can’t remember any occurring after ninth grade...\n\n"
