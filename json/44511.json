  "content": "I'm curious what most folks here think about \"fake italics\" on the web, the slanted rendering of non-italic faces when viewed in web pages. This occurs when font families lacking italic faces are used in a webpage. Common fonts such as Tahoma are like this, even Helvetica under Mac OS X 10.4:  \n`\n  font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica;\n  font-style: italic;\n`\n\nBrowsers are forced to do this for backwards compatibility but it seems like it would be nice to have a way of signaling \"no fake italic dammit!\" so that the browser would either use a non-italic face or fall back to a font family with a real italic face.\n\nSame holds true for fake bolding.\n\n",

      "content": "Depends on the typeface and the rendering technology. At 10px a well-hinted fake italic might work better than a true italic of a different font.\n\nAlso, I don't think it would be a good idea to do a fallback to the regular style or a different typeface.\n\n"
