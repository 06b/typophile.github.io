How would you usually use it for all-caps titling?\n\nCheers,\n\nThomas K.\n\n",

This may not be the answer you are seeking, but if you feel that it needs some tracking in an all-caps setting, then you will have to do the tracking yourself. At most, if you are working in Illustrator or in InDesign, you could try using the Optical Kerning option to see if more letterspacing is created that way... But that usually happens with smaller point sizes. Sorry. :-)\n\n"
