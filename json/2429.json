      "content": "Hi Caleb,   \n   \nNothing wrong with a crusty woodtype slab serif. The letterforms look fine.   \n   \nThe effort ahead of you is to take what you have and turn it into something unique. How do you make this font marketable. Well for one thing, you give it features you don't find in other fonts. Such as? Loads of ornaments, borders, and a large gammut of flourishes (all crustified like your sample). Probably a whole extra font worth. You could also make an overlay font, that adds interior details. Oh yeah, a decent lower case would push this past a whole slew of similar fonts. Looks like a fun project!   \n   \nCheers,   \nRandy   \n   \nOne piece of advice: I've found sharing at least a little info about your source material (if any) is a good thing. For example, one could wrongly assume that you printed out an existing font, autotraced it a little grungy, then called it yours, when in fact you dug up a sweet little gem at a garage sale and inked up some prints. Also, I'm curious :-)\n\n"

I open up another window and continue browsing while I wait for the other one to crash and burn.   \n   \nLooking forward to seeing where you go with this.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"
