The ’a’ is the only sort of distinctive letter in this logo. If you do have more letters, you could try the new version of the [Sans Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20090503105925/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php) that lets you pick the shapes of key letters, and then it shows which fonts have those shapes. Having the ’a’ wasn’t enough for me to spot this one, although I tried.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
