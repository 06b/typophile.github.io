RoboFog was developed by [Just Van Rossum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322071102/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Just%20Van%20Rossum), [Petr Van Blokland](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322071102/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Petr%20Van%20Blokland) and [Erik Van Blokland](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322071102/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Erik%20Van%20Blokland). It has been discontinued, but much of the work and ideas live on in [RoboFab](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322071102/http:/typophile.com/wiki/RoboFab).\n\n",
