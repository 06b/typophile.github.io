  "content": "Hi all:\n\nIs it cool to ask here for recommendations (OPINIONS from forum users) for specific fonts that might “coordinate” well with other specific (named) fonts? Meaning, if I say I have fonts x, y, and z, and I need another font that will look good with y, and z, can someone make font suggestions here for me to go look at? Or tell me what general “style” of font would contrast nicely? Etc. I ask this first because I don’t want to ask inappropriate stuff on the forum (new here), but I did see where someone else posted a similar thing and asked what fonts would be “good” together for a certain project mood and got some suggestions and information.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

      "content": "OK, this would be for the web. The two main ideas being thrown out so far are:\n\n1. Starlight Hotel [http://www.fontdiner.com/menu\\_ifm.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103054427/http:/www.fontdiner.com/menu_ifm.html \"http://www.fontdiner.com/menu\\_ifm.html\")\n\nfor title-headings. But I need something to pair it with for subheadings and smaller titles underneath it. The main text of the articles is good ole Georgia.\n\n2. The other idea is using Primal Scream [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/primal-scream/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103054427/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/primal-scream/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/primal-scream/\") for the big banner and again, SOMETHING ELSE for the sub-heads. Text is Georgia, again.\n\nThe mood is supposed to be “mentally unstable” 50s-60s housewives, if that conjures anything. Maybe like in the show “Mad Men.” I don’t know if that helps, but that’s \\*all\\* I have now. If anyone has a couple ideas for straitjacket-retro with a dash of boozy brashness, and can suggest anything for the subheads, or, for that matter a complete pairing, it’s much appreciated. :-)\n\n"
