      "content": "Hi Noah. First thing I notice is that all of your vertical strokes are too heavy. The -o- is too thin, as is the -c- and the bowl of the -d-. The -e- fills in on the left side. Perhaps instead of thinning the vert strokes you could thicken the thinnest areas of all of the letters. The exit curve on the -c- seems too thin. The bowl on the -b- seems too small, this could be because there isn't a solid base. Curves on the -m- seem too angular in comparison to the curve on the -n-. The bowl on the -p- seems to be squashed at the top right. The -c- also seems to be leaning backwards. What is your resource? From where is your inspiration coming?\n\n"

Try making them a little bit thicker than the stem width.  \nTo me it also looks like the 'o' is tilting too much to the left. It could just be me but the 'd' having the same tilt as the 'o' also looks a bit like it wants to take off to the left.  \nI think you should try to stick to one type of serif on that 's'. I like the top one.  \nThe right legs of 'n' 'h' and 'm' looks thinner than their left ones. And the hairline in those letters also looks very thin.  \nThe serif on the 'q' is weird. It should be longer to the left than it is to the right.\n\nI have probably repeated some of Tiffany's words here but I still think the contrast in certain letters needs work.\n\nI look forward to see more of this font.\n\nmagnus\n\n"

I'm afraid I simply don't understand the rationale for the modifications you've made to Bembo; them seem altogether arbitrary. As the others have pointed out, the colour is just plain wunky as a result. The relationships between thicks and thins across letters are not consistent. For example, the bowls of the p, d, b, and q are the similar, but not in the relevant way, viz stroke axis. More importantly, they don't match up well with those of a, m, n, h, and r, especially where they meet the stems.. Keep in mind that Bembo is of calligraphic heritage. You have kept the proportions from this face, while basically abandoning the calligraphic strokes and axes. I think you should probably either keep the calligraphic style, or change the proportions altogether if this design is to make sense.\n\n"

Now that you point these inconsistancies out to me many of them are painfully obvious. I think my main rationale is that I don't want to make Bembo, but I do want to be influenced by Bembo. Perhaps the randomness is due to fear of influence. Regardless, I can see I have a lot more work than I'd initially thought.

If anything, it should probably be the other way around, but only by a couple of units.\n\nYou have a swash serif on the A in a place that doesn't make sense.\n\nSome of the uppercase letters have both adnate and abrupt serifs.

I can't think how anybody could come up with a number... But -12 seems like way too little. I personally use values over 50 often, and I know I'm not alone.\n\nAnyway, don't worry about the numbers too much, worry about the color. Once you arrive at a spacing that can't be improved without kerning, you're very close to the color you want, and you kern to bring errant pairs in line. This is sort of simplified, since the **eventual** avilability of kerning should be taken into account in the base spacing (and even the black letterforms), but in the real world it's 95% there.\n\n\\> How do you deal with the optical, um, illusion(?) of spacing?\n\nI think the only way must be by applying experience  \nto (via acquiring experience from) carefully crafted  \ntests you carry out.\n\nBut looking at your latest sample, I would say that your overall\\* spacing is slightly too loose for the vertical proportions and color of the face. And once you make the spacing slightly tighter, I think you can shoot for around 11 point setting - just great for text (although I personally prefer darker color). You won't really be able to go as low as 6 though; maybe 8.\n\n\\* I say overall because it's still a bit too irregular - like look at \"adjusted. But I think it's almost there.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Somewhere along the line I made a mistake. I'm still trying to determine exactly what I failed to do, regardless the error is mine entirely and _iKern_ did not produce the results that I claimed it had. I am deeply sorry for this mistake. I know how hard Mr Marini has worked on this project and the results, the true results, of his efforts are breathtaking, one need only examine the fonts he offers free of charge on his own site to see power of his program. It is my sincere hope that my accidental misrepresentation of _iKern_ has not tainted anybody's perception of this incredible software. The fault is entirely mine, the rough spacing mistakenly attributed to _iKern_ came from my own incompetence. I only hope that Mr Marini and, indeed, the members of this community can forgive my error.  \nSincerely,  \nNoah Feldman**\n\n"

But perhaps that is what effects its unique character! For persons familar with different typefaces, it is interesting to see the different influences, e.g. a, f and r are so Bembo, while s is so Palatino. (I am actually surprised that you say the italic has nothing to do with Palatino, since there is such a strong resemblance.) And although these elements, among others, are familiar, the overall effect is so unusual that I really don't know how to judge it! Anyway, congratulations on sticking with it and trusting your own taste. I look forward to see more of your work!\n\n"
