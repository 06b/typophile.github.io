  "content": "Hi.\n\nI’m turning to all of you, since after reading this forum I can see that here is lots and lots of highly professional typographers and graphic designers around.\n\nSo I’m redesigning a magazine and decided to use Parisiene as a secondary display and body text typeface. I will allso use Porchez’s Ambroise sparingly here and there.\n\nBut i have struggled for a while with the primary bodytext typeface that would work in display size allso.\n\nMagazine has short an long stories and topics vary from fashion to world politics and photo reportages. So i need very flexible typefaces in terms of use in stories with very different contents.\n\nI would like the magazine’s typography to have a elegant, reliable and modern up to date sound to it.\n\nI know this is quite hard one, but I wouldn’t have turned to you if it wasn’t.\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Eurostile and Helvetica Rounded](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205092412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42011 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help!
