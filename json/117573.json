I tried a \"What the Font\" search on myfonts.com and searched by letter characteristics on identifont.com, but came up empty.\n\nThe shirt you reference is from the 2007-2008 season for AEK Athens, and appears to have been created by Puma. The typeface may be custom to the company, and not commercially available.\n\n"
