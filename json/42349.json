  "content": "Morning all,\n\nFirst of all, the nomenclature used for design on newspaper is new to me, so please excuse me if I’m totally out to lunch here.\n\nWe’re doing a two page ad that runs at the bottom of each page. Pretty simple, but the units given to us are a little perplexing, 40 agates high by 21 columns wide. Agate, at 5.5 pt each give me 220 pts high, but I’m at a loss as to what the “21 columns” implies.\n\nI stumbled onto something that indicated that 1 column was equal to 14 agate, and something else that implied that this is not set in stone.\n\nThe rep at the paper seems MIA and we need to get this to them today and is further complicated by the fact that I am stepping in for another (now gone) designer who has created single page ads in the past, but the dimensions of those files don’t ad up either.\n\nAny insight?\n\n [‹ Spacing sans type: where to start?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608074955/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42576 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [does anybody know... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608074955/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42538 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’s been a long while since I’ve done newspaper ads, but from what I recall, they used good ol’ inches and centimeters for their ad sizes.

Sort of what you have, but not the full height.\n\nBack in the days when newspapers were kings, many papers had a rule that your ad could not be more than one column wide per 10 agate lines of height. These days, they will sell pretty much whatever they can.\n\n"
