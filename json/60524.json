Actually, I think you were exactly right -- I think they used a Z from Futura. What simpler way to 'customize' a font?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

(for instance the U is much wider and the E much smaller.  \nAlso tried with helvetica neue...  \npretty weird, can't imagine the designer used letters from all kinds of fonts for a small sentence... :s\n\n"

      "content": "What does the sample represent? It has clearly been tightly spaced for a reason, such as style, or space saving (not legibility, I would say). It's possible that more than the Z was borrowed from another font, or that some graphic manipulating was done for artistic effect. This might all have been done with fonts that were at hand, and if the weights matched, then why not mix them to create something new?\n\nI suspect designers often do this, and it creates challenges for Type ID Board members :)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
