  "content": "I'm looking for a programming font similar to Andale Mono.\n\nBut I'd like the font to be more \"square\" and \"strict/severe\" than Andale Mono.\n\nFor instance, the \"r\" in Andale Mono bends - and I'd prefer an \"r\" with a straight line.\n\nWhich font would you recommend for a website design - a programming font similar to Andale Mono but more \"square/harsh/severe/cold/technical-looking\"?\n\nAnd with few round - bending - or ornamental details :)\n\nI'd be grateful for any and all recommendations - thanks a lot!\n\n(The 10 programming fonts listed at: [http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417083718/http:/hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts \"http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts\")\n\nall have rounded shapes either in the \"r\"' or the \"l\"-letters.\n\nOf those 10 fonts, I prefer Andale Mono because it does not look overtly \"designed\" - I like its cold, machine-like feel - but it's still not perfect :)\n\n",
