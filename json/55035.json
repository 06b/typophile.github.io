You will see 2 files...one\\> with 2 cars only and one with 2 cars on a background of stars and a map etc. We would like \\*\\*JUST THE 2 CARS\\*\\* seperated for 4 colour process.

      "content": "Separations refer to the 4-color printing process (on an offset press) where you separate the colors (CMYK) to 4 printing plates. Normally your printer can handle this (in fact I'd highly encourage it). But occasionally a designer will have to prepare the files. Anyhow see [http://help.adobe.com/en\\_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e410010...](http://web.archive.org/web/20120506075758/http:/help.adobe.com/en_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-7794a.html \"http://help.adobe.com/en\\_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-7794a.html\")  \nfor how to create/print separations.  \nAlso a read of [http://help.adobe.com/en\\_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e410010...](http://web.archive.org/web/20120506075758/http:/help.adobe.com/en_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-779da.html \"http://help.adobe.com/en\\_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-779da.html\") would be recommended as well.\n\nFinally I recommend working in RGB until you have everything finalized before converting to CMYK.\n\n"

      "content": "I think you are worrying too much about the 4 color process. Photoshop automatically takes care of that issue, assuming that you have the color setting preference set for either US web coded (SWOP) v2 or US Sheet-fed coated v2. This can be achieved within photoshop by going to edit/color settings, a dialogue box will open with drop-downs under Working spaces. I recommend that you set the RGB to Adobe RGB 1998 and the CMYK to one of the settings I mentioned ( sheet-fed or web). If in doubt, contact the printer and they will guide you.\n\nThat's it. If you want to check out the separations click on channels window in photoshop and turn on and off the channels and you will see the CMYK on their own. Unless you really know what you are doing, leave them alone.\n\nThere are advanced corrections you can make to the images using adjustments such as curves, levels etc. but for now I think this will do.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nG.\n\n"

      "content": "Well, if he is asked to make color separations, I guess that is what he has to do.  \nIt is true Photoshop automatically has the 4 colors each on a different channel, but I presume his client wants these in seperate files as well. The first link bemerx25 has posted shows how to do this.\n\nI do wonder why they want you to do this, though, since most modern printers will separate colors themselves with their RIP.\n\nYou should go back to the client and ask what it is he wants exactly. Does he really want 4 files each with 1 color? For what printing technique is this going to be? Etc.  \nFor offset printing I don't see why you should separate the colors yourself. If it is for screen printing I could see why, but even then I think most screen printers will take care of it themselves...\n\nAlso, this isn't exactly graphic design work, but prepress or DTP.\n\n"

I regularly get requests from people companies who use the wrong terminology (which ends up confusing everyone involved), or just plain don't know what they're talking about/asking for.\n\nArtsions, you should probably get more info from these people about what specifically they're asking for. I suppose they could be asking you to save it in DCS format, which splits up the file into separate CMYK files, but I haven't seen those used in years.\n\n\"Also, this isn’t exactly graphic design work, but prepress or DTP.\"\n\nTrue, but definitely something a designer should know.\n\n"
