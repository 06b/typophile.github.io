  "content": "I'm currently working on a student project where I'm supposed to do a movie poster. Now I'm struggeling with the hard work in finding two different fonts. The first one, and the most significant, is the font often used to present the director aso. in the \"footer\" of the poster (see army of darkness). The second one is a font similar to the one used for the movie Casablanca (see Casablanca).   \n   \nLook at the two images attached.   \n   \nI have found one font simmilar to \"casablanca\" but , unfortunatelly for me, it cost some money. My student budget doesn't have any space for this kind of investments :-(   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100325211221im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27541.jpg) ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100325211221im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27542.jpg)\n\n",

If you can't find enough variety there to make your posters, then you aren't showing much creativity. At least this site will not have re-named copies of commercial fonts, even if some are inspired by certain ones.\n\n"
