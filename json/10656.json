Meaning, I do believe in what I've written, but sometimes the boss doesn't.   \n--   \nIf we are designers, and our job is to create identities for our clients that are to be unique and original, creating for them a strong presence in the marketplace in which they sell,which in turn will help them become profitable, doesn't it behoove us to have a greater variety of typefaces at our fingertips?   \n   \nAlso, you can always build the price (or part of it) of the typeface into the cost of the work for which it was used.\n\n"
