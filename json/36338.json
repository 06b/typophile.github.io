There might be graphics involved but the name will have prominence.\n\nKey words are, empowerement, luxury, contemporary, approachability and possibly subtly suggest her asian influence (specifically japanese).

I wouldn’t even know how to unify “empowerment” with “luxury”, or “luxury” with “approachability” — I’d say “luxury” pretty much negates the other two.\n\nIf anyone actually pulls it off to deliver something that echoes all your five “keywords” to the majority of the audience, I’d call him a grandmaster of design without any hesitance.\n\n"

But that’s probably not what you mean.\n\nSo it might be better for you to describe what you want to achieve with more than just one word. If I don’t know what to associate with the term “empowerment” even when it’s spelt out in front of me, I certainly won’t know it any better when it’s “symbolized” somehow in a wordmark.\n\n"

One day she’s had enough and decides I want to be a (insert career of choice). Having gotten that education and a satisfying career she wants to have the comforts never allowed to her. It’s an eff u to the world so to speak, “I’m allowed to be happy”. She decides to commission a piece of artwork to celebrate her new found freedom. She hires Shayla because the brand and artwork express what she is feeling.\n\nDoes that help clarify things?\n\nI suppose self-empowerment is more accurate.\n\n"

She intends to make this her trademark. Nobody else does this so we figure it’s good to insist on it and make it memorable.
