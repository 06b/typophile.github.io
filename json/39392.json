      "content": "what I like:  \n- white space, correlates conceptually with outer space  \n- the upside/down, reverse idea in the titles  \n- mrs eaves for main text\n\nrecommendations:  \n- too much white space, it gets to boring all along, try to alternate it with full/half size color/photo pages (or clipped elements)  \n- the elements on most of the spreads look cluttered, try to compose them in groups, and handle them consequently (for example the chapter titles are not on the same height)  \n- that the title on spread 55/56 is crossing the photograph in an unelegant manner  \n- mix of justified and unjustified setting in the main text, try to handle the main text only in one form of setting  \n- mix of main text sizes, try to get along only with one size, same for paragraph length  \n- mrs eaves for the titles, maybe you can find another font for the titles, which could be more related to ufos/outer space etc. ( maybe a sans serif with a slightly technic/constructed character)\n\n"
