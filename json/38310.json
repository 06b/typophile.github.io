Can anybody recommend one that has a focus on logo or type design. That would be great.

I am not the author of that great book... and I think some of that info in my profile is already needing updated, I’m no longer in Warsaw. :-)\n\nI may have sounded like a commercial in my initial post, or worse, some gushing fanboy. Truth is, I was really impressed with the book, and so I’m just praising it. Note that the book is not only based on designing logos with Illustrator. There is a lot of history and how to solve logo design problems. I enjoyed it. The Illustrator based content is towards the end of the book, but it, in my opinion, is among the best direction I’ve ever seen. You can preview the book at Amazon to get a feel for the content.\n\nIn truth, I someday would like to write a book of the same caliber on creating great logo designs. But that is later down the road. My first plans are going to be taking the custom work that I’ve done and making fonts from them.\n\nAlso, I did order **The Secret Life of Logos**. It should arrive sometime soon and I will post my impressions of it.\n\n"

Not Leslie’s fault ... it was held up at customs, where they charged me 2.36 customs (and a five dollar fee on top). And I thought we had free trade with the US.\n\nThe money doesn’t bother me, it is the time. I just wish those guys at customs could read faster.\n\n"
