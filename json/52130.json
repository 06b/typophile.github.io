  "content": "one of the perks of working where i do is that behind me sits a lady who is responsible for maintaining a music library for the salvos.\n\nwhen she gets multiple copies of songs and other materials, she often needs to throw them out because of space... well... when i found this out i asked her if it would be possible to pass them along to me. so i'm often getting beautiful old music books and others odd pieces of paper.\n\nhere is a couple of things i recently acquired, and i think they are beautiful.\n\nfirst the front of a page titled 'Famous Cornet Solos'\n\ndoes anybody know what the sans used could be?\n\nsecond is from the back of that page - it looks like a beautiful piece of penmanship, but i'm unsure.\n\nthanks for listening\n\nbyebye - sye :)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [FCS\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120730110530/http:/typophile.com/files/FCS_1.jpg) | 197.4 KB |\n| [FCS\\_1\\_detail.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120730110530/http:/typophile.com/files/FCS_1_detail.jpg) | 261.19 KB |\n| [FCS\\_2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120730110530/http:/typophile.com/files/FCS_2.jpg) | 142.73 KB |\n\n",
