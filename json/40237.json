It’s all over the place typographically. I was trying to make it seem old and yet new, like it was trying to be futuristic when made in 1933.\n\nThe design is still a bit rough around the edges. You’ll notice that a lot of the forms change the metrics of things, particularly the areas on the right side.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated. Additionally, I’d be curious to hear suggestions for how to add more variety to the different forms. My fear is that they’ll all start to look the same in time.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Josh\n\n[www.MagnetismStudios.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123034559/http:/www.magnetismstudios.com/ \"www.MagnetismStudios.com\")\n\n"

And thanks for posting Josh, I think you did a great job with it.\n\nMy only idea for adding variety for the forms is maybe if you could add a random adjective generator for some of the fields. Oh and also if you could premade famous apologies in history, I think that could be really funny.\n\n"
