I have used fairy tales in different languages for the ones available (in English, Esperanto and Swedish), and more will be added: in German, Italian (Boccaccio's Decameron, one short story per booklet), French and Spanish, but it will take some time.   \n   \nBesides showing different typefaces, they can be good reading. The booklets can be downloaded at [www.omnibus.se](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018131329/http:/www.omnibus.se/).\n\n"
