  "content": "About a year ago I purchased some 14-pt. sans-serif lead type labeled “metroline.” Its great stuff— and I use it constantly. However, I’m thinking that its mislabeled. I can’t find any listing anywhere for a font called “metroline”— and the ones with similar names look NOTHING like my type. Perhaps the experts here might recognize it. A printed sample is at:\n\n[http://www.magicfishpress.com/eric/metroline.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20050528001232/http:/www.magicfishpress.com/eric/metroline.jpg)\n\nI don’t know who the type founders might have been, either. No markings and no original packaging.\n\nGood luck! Thanks for having a look!\n\neric wilcox  \nmagic fish press\n\n",

Off hand I can only think of two Monotype operations that pinmarked their type, Baltimore Type Foundry and Phoenix Type Foundry.\n\nAnd, to make it more confusing, not all firms casting foundry type (as opposed to Monotype) had pinmarks.\n\nGerald\n\n"

      "content": "Richard\n\nThe second part of this has to do with nicks and feet. While there are certain general casting practices, there are far too many variables involved to use either of these as positive identification. Examples:\n\nIn many cases Monotype might have no feet, in others it may have, depending upon the type of Monotype caster. On the other hand, foundry, which often has distinct feet, as this is actually how the jet is removed, doesn’t always have them either. European metal foundry that has been ground to Anglo-American type height is easily identifiable as the feet have been ground off and the grinding pattern is usually discernible. But even here, several American firms that licensed European fonts often cast them at type high with feet or made special arrangements to have them cast that way at the foreign foundry.\n\nMetal type technology is as much of a mess in its variations as the continual evolution of digital type formats.\n\nGerald\n\n"
