This is like many very similar brush lettering fonts that were made as film types. URW also has digitized some of these old brush lettering typefaces.\n\nIs the age of this pre-1990? If so, all this lettering may be film types (photo-lettering), whose originals were hand-drawn.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
