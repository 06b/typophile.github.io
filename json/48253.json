I challenge anyone who is interested to set the following text in the typeface or faces of their choice and post a PNG or GIF on this thread. The idea is to see which font is best suited for election time prattle. You can go serious if you like but I am hoping for comic relief from the way-too-long barrage of campaign rhetoric that we have been suffering through this year.  \nKeep the width of the file to less than 575 pixels to avoid scrolling please.\n\nHere is the text:\n\n“Awakened voters quip, botched president big sleazy jerk—fix him!”\n\nChrisL\n\nPS: So as not to leave you hanging, the judges will all be Florida voters over the age of 80 who are named Chad. :-)\n\n [‹ Public apology & gratitude](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122122535/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48233 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Can someone help me find this font please?! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122122535/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48286 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
