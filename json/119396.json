  "content": "I heard that today's most popular en therefore most used font is Calibri. Now I wonder if somebody remembers what were the most popular fonts during the nineties and the nillies? I guess it was first Times New Roman, followed by Georgia and now sans-serif Calibri (but this might be too much inspired by the history of one company: Microsoft).  \nDid someone found some literature about this subject?\n\n",
