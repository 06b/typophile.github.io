I was thinking of making some sort of poster with some info and graphs, and was wondering if anyone has any hard data on these guys I can use? Like number of typefaces made, books written etc. Anything you can think of really, I'd be most grateful!\n\n\\*edit\\* Oops, I forgot, that's Morris Fuller Benton by the way.\n\n",

The reason I haven't got more specific questions is that I would like to get some input as to what to include in the poster (IF anyone has got an idea that they are willing to share!)\n\nJames:  \nWhile your sarcasm is helpful, I don’t see the hurt in using Typophile as a resource in addition to any others available. Do you eat steak with only a knife, even if you got a fork as well? I have always perceived Typophile to be an open and helpful community, but if it is not supposed to be used as a resource as I have tried to do here, then I am sorry. It certainly won't happen again.\n\nSo, unless I have stepped on some toes here, I would still like some help. Most of all I need ideas as to what to include, but if anyone has any specific data to share, I'd be much obliged. If not, I'll find out somehow (I recently learned of something called a “library”!).\n\n"

And definitely make use of your local library. Maybe you should be asking something like, \"What's the most authoritative book on Adrian Frutiger and his work?\" Then we might be able to supply some better information (and no, I don't know the answer to that).\n\nAs far as your idea behind the poster... You (and your teacher) will have to decide what's necessary for this design project to succeed. Personally I'd love to see specimens of their typefaces. Perhaps pick one or two faces that represent their creator and set some type.\n\n"

If you were using Typophile as a resource you would have used a Google search to find the relevant information instead of just asking people to give it to you. Get off your butt, do some work, and then ask after you’ve found out which one of those five designers has not been the subject of numerous books, essays, and magazine/journal articles.\n\n"

I'm finding it hard to ask the right questions, I guess. Okay. I'll try posing a new question then, that I think is more suited to Typophile's unique capabilities as a discussion forum:\n\n**What quantifiable qualities can one assign to a type designer, apart from the number of typefaces he or she has made?**\n\nAnd I would hate for anyone to think me so lazy as to not even bothering to check Wikipedia before taking up anyone elses time! I have read the wikis for all the designers, as well as a slew of books (American Type Designers, A Secret History of Letters, that huge Jan Tschichold book which name eludes me right now, and a couple more). However, all the Wikipedia entries states say things like \"Typefaces Tschichold designed include\" – \"include\" being the word that troubles me. Anyway, nevermind that – I'll find the numbers somehow.\n\nFlorian:  \nThank you! I will see if our library has those first thing tomorrow. I'm doubtful of the Frutiger one though, if it is recently published as you say. But I'll keep my fingers crossed!\n\nJames:  \nYou are being less than gracious. You are assuming that I have done no work whatsoever, which isn't true. My first post was poorly worded, and I have apologized for that. But even if I was asking for you to give me something for nothing, there is no need to lash out like you do. Do you kick beggars too? Now, I have posted a new question, which I hope is to his majesty's liking. If not, then there is no need to waste your time (see, that's the magic trick: If you think someone is about to waste your time, IGNORE that someone!).\n\n"

It would be simple enough to lay out a timeline including each of his accomplishments (type faces designed) to try to draw some connections between them. Obviously there is some overlapping in their lives and careers...makes you wonder how aware they were of each other, how and if they might have influenced each other. It's not like they were googling each other, and with living in different parts of the world (at different times)...it's all kind of fascinating. Being that each of them accomplished so much without having the technology and the global social communities (like this one) we have today does call into question how necessary and useful any of this really is. As stated above, there are books and libraries, like there always have been. It might be interesting to try to pull off this report WITHOUT the using internet...unless you enjoy having your blood pressure raised by assaulting sarcastic comments from the know-it-alls!\n\n"

I don't think Kottis is asking us to do a project for him, but rather give suggestions on aesthetics and resources he can use. While Google can be everyone's friend from time to time, sometimes a small amount of help from another person may make somebody's job a lot easier. Lastly, he asked the right people, and you can't really penalize him for that. Lastly, when you look at it, the Wikipedia entries and their sources seem a little less full than a more popular/well-known figure of history, thus requiring deeper digging.\n\nTo shorten that paragraph up and put it in a way I'm used to saying:  \n私はあなたのトロール率: 0/10!\n\n"
