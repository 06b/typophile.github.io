  "content": "Hello\n\nI'm new :)\n\nI wonder if you could help me with a project I am working on. It is for a packaging range and I need to find a font which looks like French handwriting. Of course REAL writing would be great but 1. I don't know anyone French 2. Will need to be able to add to this range in years to come so therefore need consistency.\n\nI'v looked on da font and Armandine and Valerie are pretty good. Here are some examples of something lovely attached (have I done it right??)\n\nPlease can you suggest anything else?  \nThanks, Caroline\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [mathcandle1-pop.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100628025708/http:/typophile.com/files/mathcandle1-pop.jpg) | 238.73 KB |\n| [cote.amber\\_.incen\\_.book\\_.2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100628025708/http:/typophile.com/files/cote.amber_.incen_.book_.2.jpg) | 16.08 KB |\n\n",
