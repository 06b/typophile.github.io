Its really loose and open ended, and too much I think. I’m going in two days a week, and the other day I went in, sat down to work for two hours, and then left when there wasn’t anything else to do.\n\nI really like the guy who runs the brand, but I’m not too inspired or influenced by the designers I’m actually working with?\n\nI’m not getting paid, and sometimes, I just ask myself, what am I doing?\n\nAm I mistaken that there’s awesome internships out there?\n\nAm I mistaken that structure is overated.\n\n [‹ North Seattle/Everett Typecon Carpool](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111001318/http:/typophile.com/node/35531 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [looking for \"FontShop Magazin fonts\" issues 1-8 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111001318/http:/typophile.com/node/35511 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch to say that if you ask people there questions, they will be willing and happy to give you answers.\n\nIf they sent you home early that day, that’s one thing. But if it was your decision to leave early, well, you also could have decided to walk around and ask if you could sit and watch the designers doing their job. Or other workers. You can learn about lots of different jobs there, and get an idea of the bigger picture. You can’t get that kind of knowledge at school, or from books.\n\nI’ve had to do things I wasn’t too crazy about in my life, but each one of them was an experience that let me gain some knowledge... I’m sorry if I sound like a boring old fart! ;-) Design school was like that, too... What I got out of it was directly proportional to what I gave it.\n\n"

Not everyone in my year had great experiences but the general concensus was that the more effort they put into it the better the result for them, it seems to me you are looking for more than you are prepared to give. If there isn’t anything else to do – look for something yourself, identify an area that you think you can improve on, do some work and ask for a crit or ask to visit a supplier learn how a job progresses from design, artwork, through to print and finishing.

From what I can tell, most internships are not great, nor are they very interesting, but that’s not the point. At the most basic level, and internship is just a window into the working world, especially the white-collar office world, for kids who would otherwise have no job experience save retail and restaurants. By bringing interns in businesses are doing a favor as much to other businesses as they are to interns, because it creates a large pool of young workers who will not show up for the first day of work and be completely clueless.\n\n"

I learned far more in two years of actual practice than I did in college, and am very thankful I had that apprenticeship / internship experience.\n\nPersonally, I feel that a true apprenticeship with an experienced typesetter is often a better education than most undergraduate programs can possibly hope to offer. It’s just a sad reality, in what I have seen of undergraduate design education in the United States.\n\nMy own experience was with a blue-collar job printer and typesetter who had ink and machine oil in every pore and knew the ins and outs of every single piece of letterpress or litho equipment in use from the turn of the century to the mid 1980s when I worked with him. He did get cigar ash in the hellbox so my daily chore of distributing all that type was not a pleasant one, but he was a helluva guy and an inspiration to me. It wasn’t until I took a class or two with typographer and pressman Lee Engdahl many years later than I met someone else who inspired me the same way.\n\nI was lucky enough to be very young - still in high school - during this time, and living with my parents, but I can understand it would be a big risk to go without pay for a period long enough to have some value. However, if young people interested in book arts have the opportunity to study with folks like Lee, Jim Sherraden at Hatch, Peter Koch, David Goines, the folks at Arion or Yolla Bolly, etc. - I say live like a monk and do it, as you’ll have skills that nobody else of your generation will have, and you will be much in demand for them throughout your life.\n\nJoshua\n\n—-\n\njlt : [http://www.hewnandhammered.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111001318/http:/www.hewnandhammered.com/ \"http://www.hewnandhammered.com\")\n\n"

If the recessions of the 90’s hadn’t come along, I might have gone back there to work after graduation.\n\nOne thing that probably looks worthless to a recent grad is the whole aspect of office interaction; professional behavior, I’ve realized, is not necessarily a given even at the most prestigious film studios, ad agencies or publishing houses. And learning to navigate the office politics and to behave professionally are skills you simply can’t pick up in school. So while it might seem dreary to work for peanuts and do uninteresting grunt work, as with anything in life, You get out of it what you put in.\n\nAsk questions, act interested, keep your eyes open, listen to people talk. Ask yourself questions and see what you find out. One thing everyone likes is initiative, so if there’s nothing going on, ask for more work, see if something on the back burner can get done, organize the library, improve a process, help out any little way. It’s likely to make a good impression.\n\n"

But I was referring more to the heads of Microsoft, Intel, and other American businesses that want as little taxation and regulation as possible, but then blame the state of America’s schools on the government and demand access to more H1-B workers.\n\n<cite>Just recently a student revolt at Gallaudet University...</cite>\n\nThe nominee actually has a very record and Gallaudet is in the toilet because the board too often caves to student pressure instead of keeping standards high. After those student protests the agencies accrediting Gallaudet realized how bad things are over there and started threatening to pull the school’s accreditation entirely.\n\n<cite>...then why school?</cite>\n\nWell, not everyone goes to art school to be a designer. I just went because I was sick of my career and I stumbled into design because I wanted to do CG fine art and my schools fine art department is extremely anti-computer. And if we didn’t have anal-retentive type teachers out there, who would teach students to not use fake small caps?\n\n"

Speaking from what i’ve seen, American students don’t always make the grade - and worse, many act like a good job is their birthright.\n\n"

One key group of customers in the case of state-supported schools is voters and tax payers, who pay the biggest bill. They want students to come out as responsible and productive citizens. Another set of customers are the parents who pay tuition. Another set are the students. These don’t necessarily want the same things.\n\nSome students, for example, mainly want to get drunk. Is it then the job of the school to give them free beer?\n\nIn particular the idea that students know best what the curriculum should be is wrong. If they already knew they wouldn’t have to study.\n\nI have been through the student power protests and arguments in the ’60s. The sound thing is that students should have a voice in college governance, especially in matters affecting student quality of life. But they should not have a dominant voice, and they should not determine the curriculum. They are only one constituency, and often they don’t know better than the others what is best for the educational mission of the University.\n\n"

Since ancient Greece, higher education has held a place separate and above the fray of commerce, but that has changed in recent years. We’ll have to see where we end up.\n\nAs for evilfran’s concerns that we aren’t addressing the question: I think we are _precisely_ addressing the question. But to make it more clear: look for an internship (and it may be this one) where you feel challenged. Look for an internship where you feel you are —despite your inexperience — respected, at least on some level. Look for an internship where the contacts you make and the experience you gain is the most valuable thing you take away from your stint (regardless of pay) and you feel richer for the experience.\n\n"

It was very educational but hard, no worries about what to do with the non-existant free time.\n\nI find a system where you work unpaid unbelievable. I doubt whether anyone would agree on working for free in Finland (not counting in charities and voluntary work here).\n\n"
