Ever since, new weights have been added to complete six variables and two different options for accents.  \nThe typeface adds a fresh, bold and non-rational feeling to headlines and titles in books and posters in display sizes where emphasis and detail are equally important.  \nRandomly-generated contextual alternates included in the family contribute to add a distinctive look to words with repeating characters, whenever they occur next to each other.  \n [http://dizajndesign.sk/fonts\\_Poleno\\_info.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817161708/http:/dizajndesign.sk/fonts_Poleno_info.htm \"http://dizajndesign.sk/fonts\\_Poleno\\_info.htm\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Poleno\\_typophile.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817161708/http:/typophile.com/files/Poleno_typophile_0.gif) | 25.17 KB |\n\n",
