To try and compare the most common types for web, you may want to check the fabulous [typetester.maratz.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20071212021119/http:/typetester.maratz.com/).\n\nAs for the navigation / menus, you may want to consider types that stay legible and ’clean’, even when used / presented very small, and on screen. _( Like one of those greyscale bitmap / pixel fonts. )_\n\nDav\n\n"

For example: I recommended ’ [( New ) Critter](http://web.archive.org/web/20071212021119/http:/www.letterror.com/catalog/critter/index.html)’, from LettError, previously.
