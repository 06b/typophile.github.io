I know i've seen it before used in more classy circumstances, like on the covers of paperbacks from the seventies...\n\nI also think this font is used for the Netflix commercial, for the \"Wrightnow Family\" title at the end of the skit...\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018061345im_/http:/typophile.com/files/0000040372_20070607144010_5659.jpg)\n\n",
