Since it is going into a PDF file, I am at least recreating the cover material in Illustrator and am setting the title in Palatino Small Caps. But, to my eye, the \"G\" at the end of the word \"QUESTIONING\" seems like it is moving away from the rest of the word. I opened up the font in FOG and there is no kerning pair for \"NG\" (or \"ng\" since it is small caps).\n\nIs this really a sidebearing problem (if it really is a problem)? It's just that in this particular instance, the \"G\" seems to be floating away from the rest of the text, whereas, for example, in the word \"HONG\" the spacing seems fine.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [questioning.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725010735/http:/typophile.com/files/questioning.gif) | 2.26 KB |\n\n",

This is because what looks good isn't linear with increasing size, and also caps have to be designed to fit the lower case, etc.\n\nSo I would say, just do it. You can check your eye by posting it here and getting feedback.\n\n"
