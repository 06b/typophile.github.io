  "content": "I am currently replacing the current typeface for a publication that was previously using “Swiss” for the body copy. We would like to have a Humanist sans family that is large like Aaux Pro [http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MzE5](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021024153/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MzE5 \"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MzE5\") The reason why we are not using Aaux Pro is because our sister magazine is now using it. I did find Joshua Darden’s font Freight Sans to be quite nice as well [http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021024153/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php \"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php\") it just needs the H&JS to be loosend up a bit. If you could give me your opinion on these two that would be fantastic. and if you have any suggestions of other fonts that would be much appreciated.  \nThe fonts I was previously looking at were:  \nAlber  \nCorisande  \nDepot  \nFlama  \nFF Meta  \nFF Scala Sans  \nlisboa  \nMundo Sans  \nVista Sans  \nWhitney\n\n",

For more info, read about the [improved Apex](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021024153/http:/vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/Example+About/), which might not be a bad alternative itself.\n\n"
