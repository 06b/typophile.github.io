Unfortunately some time after I did it changes were requested and (apparently) the agency had lost track of who had done the original (me!), so the hack job that is used now was created, I'm—assuming done in-house. The script of the word \"Greatest\" is done so poorly that it's beyond me why Artslons would want to replicate it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020182710im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fuddruckers_3671.gif)\n\n"
