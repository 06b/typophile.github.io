On a couple of hours this is what I have.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207163826im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_5817.jpg)\n\n.  \nIt comes from a simplified combination of an “H” and a “V” (my name and surname first letters), with a minimalist look, the dot tries to balance things. I’m aware it’s not clear and legible, but i think this could work only has a mark. What do you guys think? ...Start again? :)\n\nFeel free to comment.  \nThanks in advance\n\nRegards\n\n [‹ Please Read: Design Forum Suggestions](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207163826/http:/typophile.com/design_readme \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Futura Condensed vs. Futura for Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207163826/http:/typophile.com/node/52428 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
