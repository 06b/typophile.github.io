[FF Bau](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051956/http:/www.christianschwartz.com/bau.shtml) by Christian Schwartz is a digital interpretation of it. Hope that helps you for finding the exact one …\n\n"

See the lack of kerning in the scan.\n\nThe sample of Royal Grotesk that Renko provided is most likely of a digitized typeface and thus many details could have been altered when redrawing it.\n\n"
