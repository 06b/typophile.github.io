The regular weight has flat terminals (at the top of the t and h for example), but the bold weight shown in the Big Brother logo has angled terminals.   \n   \nIs this an anomoly or is this some design feature I'm just naive about? Did multiple designers work on the different weights?   \n   \n//joe\n\n"
