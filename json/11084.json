Nice, elegant work.   \n   \nOne thing I would do is add weights. This thin of a weight...it's difficult to find uses. Oh + an uppercase. ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416151012im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nAlso, see the bezier work of Christian Robertson in this forum and Bernhard Fashion.   \n   \nIf you can design an uppercase that matches the elegance of the lowercase, then you'll have something special.   \n   \n   \nbj\n\n"
