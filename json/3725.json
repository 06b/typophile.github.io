The kerning info imports   \njust fine, but sidebearings are only added to the right side (and   \nin strange large values, at that). I've tried importing the .met,   \n.afm, and the bitmap file. What up?   \n   \nFontographer 4.1.4, Mac\n\n",

Some   \npeople on the FontLab list say this works, but not for me. The   \nsidebearings copy, but not the kerns. Do the fonts have to have   \nthe same encoding? I am not sure how to change mine properly.\n\n"

Select the characters from   \nfrom the file whose sidebearings you want to copy.   \n3.) Then Edit \\> Copy   \n4.) Switch to the open file to which you'd like   \nto apply the sidebearings and select the same   \ncharacters (this is key).   \n5.) Then Edit \\> Paste Special   \n6.) Select the left and right sidebearing options   \nand hit ok.   \n   \nThis should do the trick.   \nThere are others ways to do this but this   \nis the fastest and smoothest.\n\n"
