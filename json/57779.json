Doh!\n\nI was unable to source the original cut, but am taking a guess that it was a display cut that was only available as phototype. There was a variance in how the letters were drawn, probably adjusted optically for a larger point size—and the main difference was the lack of ink traps. That ended up being the key to making the type look authentic. Whenever we used Futura in collateral, we redrew it so that it lacked the ink traps.”\n\nDoes anyone here know if there is a digital version of the display cut of Futura that doesn’t have the inktraps?\n\n",
