  "content": "Gentlemen,\n\nI am requesting your advice...\n\nI have been coding our company website and I'm having a hard time choosing fonts. Initially we had Google Fonts but they weren't doing it for me. I have very little experience and don't see typography in the same way you guys do.\n\nI purchased Proxima Nova (Thin, Regular, Bold) and Baskerville (Medium Bold). My intention was to make Baskerville the heading font and Proxima Nova the body but it just doesn't look right to me.\n\nBrief background about company: Established 1987 in New York City. I am a wholesale supplier of Men's designer tailored clothing and Women's contemporary. Our logo which was professionally designed is in Baskerville.\n\nQuestion: Please help me with making a decision on the following:\n\nChoices - Proxima Nova (Thin, Regular, Bold) including \"A\" and \"S\"  \nBaskerville (Medium Bold)\n\nHeading Font?  \nBody Font?  \nHeading font size?  \nBody Font size?  \nLine height for Heading?  \nLine height for Body?  \nLetter spacing for Heading?  \nLetter spacing for Body?\n\nI REALLY appreciate your time. I'm stuck and keep changing my mind due to inexperience.\n\n-Mike\n\n",
