  "content": "Hi all,   \n   \nMy friend bough this latest version of Adobe font folio in OT format. He was surprised when he found out that there aren�t certain glyphs in the package of western type fonts. By this I mean certain Croatian glyphs such as &#268;; &#269;; &#262;; &#263;. There are some \"�; &#272;; etc.\" but not all.   \n   \nI tried to access them thru glyph palette in Adobe illustrator CS, but much to my surprise there weren't there.   \nAny info about this.   \n   \nthanks\n\n",
