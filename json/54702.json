  "content": "I am currently doing a project for a restaurant in Glasgow. The restaurant is installing a new facade in the Art Deco/Streamline Moderne style and I am wondering what typefaces would have historically been used during the period. I am hoping to use a sans face in all caps as i know this is more in keeping with this particular architectural style. It should also present a more contemporary/modern appearance rather than a pastiche of the old. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSome links to refresh the memory...\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline\\_Moderne](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020010219/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline_Moderne \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline\\_Moderne\")  \n [http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Streamline\\_dir...](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020010219/http:/www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Streamline_dir.html \"http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Streamline\\_dir.html\")\n\n",
