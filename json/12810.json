  "content": "Hello,  \nI am working on a CD layout. All of the songs are in English except for one that is in Japanese. I'd like to use [FF Info Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023161413/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11189.0.0) for the layout but I'm not sure if there's a Japanese font that goes well with it. I'm willing to change to another sans-serif if a smooth combination is known.  \nI'd be very appreciative if anyone has links or information on this question.  \nThank you kindly!\n\n",
