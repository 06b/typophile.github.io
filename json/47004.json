  "content": "Welcome to our second newsletter! :)\n\nCheapProFonts is steadily growing. We get more and more visitors, and we have more and more fonts reworked with our special large multilingual character set available. We hope you will enjoy our newest ones - they were a joy to work with!\n\nIn this news release I present 12 fonts:  \n- 5 from Ray Larabie  \n- 4 from Brian Kent  \n- 2 from Nick Curtis  \n- 1 from myself - and it’s free! :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090814213304im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/CheapProFonts-NEWS-08-Q2_6437.gif)\n\nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting “foreign” languages (languages requiring more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\n\nIt is a bit more work making these fonts than first meets the eye - I do not simply make some generic diacritics, slap them together with the existing letters and generate the fonts. That would be sloppy ;)\n\nFirst I check the outlines of the existing letters, fixing any bad nodes, often normalizing the spacing and adjusting some glyphs. Then I take a close look at the kerning, improving it where neccesary and preparing it for OpenType class kerning. Only when the basic font is OK do I start expanding the character set, always using diacritics that matches the design of the letters. Finally I generate and test the fonts, make graphics and text for their presentation and upload the files.\n\nIt is a lot more work than I envisioned when I started this site, but I have still managed to release fonts almost weekly!\n\nCheck our site for constant new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\n\nRoger S. Nelsson  \n—  \n [http://www.CheapProFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090814213304/http:/www.cheapprofonts.com/)  \nHigh quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers with a small budget!\n\n",
