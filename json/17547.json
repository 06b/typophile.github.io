  "content": "Hi Guys,  \nI need help with this one! I am working on a logo for a clothing brand based in London. They are aiming at the very highest level of the streat/casual market, and selling worldwide. So the logo must work internationally. I have gone for an image to represent the pagan greenman god. The brand wanted, a folk/pagan feel but with a mix of traditional/modern style. It needs to be instatly recognisable and distinctive, and memorable.\n\nIt will be used for prited catalogue, on garments, labels, stickers and web. It is still in development so colours can change.\n\nwhats your thoughts?\n\nthanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140728112710im_/http:/typophile.com/files/merlin.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo for mailout.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140728112710/http:/typophile.com/files/logo%20for%20mailout.jpg) | 33.75 KB |\n| [Untitled-2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140728112710/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-2_4.jpg) | 23.26 KB |\n\n",

The marca registrada over the I is a nice touch, IMHO.\n\nThe type may want to be tracked out a bit; tightly-spaced caps carry less of an association with \"elegance\" and are sometimes hard to read.\n\nI am very, very glad to see there are still people who when asked to create a folk/pagan feel do not go straight to uncial lettering!\n\n"

Was this what you meant?  \nregarding the logo I do not want it to be seen as a Che Guevara rip, so will need to change it, would like it simplified also. Wat are peoples thougths on a direction to go in?\n\nthanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140728112710im_/http:/typophile.com/files/merlin-type.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "The type is killing the potential. I love the direction of the horned man. But, scratch the type. With some illustrated like that you need to keep the type simple and the illustration separate from it. Fashion needs no explanation. Especially if this is going towards the level of high end Covent Garden or Notting Hill or wherever else is on point now.\n\nThe two last versions you have posted ... the idea of the antlers and the M is interesting, but the typefaces you've chosen are too well known in other areas. I'd really keep the logo separate from the logotype.\n\n"

Regarding final type that will be used, I am looking for something more interesting at the moment.\n\nI had the same thought myself hat logo and type together are killing it. The one with out is the direction Im going in. But my minds blank now, and I need some ideas or comments, on what is working and what is not. Im going back to drawing board now to play with some ideas and will post soon. thanks.\n\nPS: your assumption on brand was correct, is selling in Covent garden, Liberty, and somewhere in Notting Hill, along side labels such as Silas, PAM, Supreme, Bathing ape, Stussy etc. But the label is alot cleaner and less graphics based, so logo needs to reflect this.\n\n"

I think they will develop final logo type, and overall typeface for packaging. But it would be interesting to show them the antler type for reference, it may work but only separate to main logo.\n\nWhat type font do you think might work? Do you think it should be sans?\n\n"

Logo wise, I can see that their is a similarity, but I do not think it looks forced or intentional, what do others think. I never had this is mind when doing this one. Please can I have some feed back from others on this matter? I think the Bape logo is far more like a silhouette, where as the Merlin logo is far more stylized in design. This is why I have tried to make is as symmetrically proportionate as possible. But maybe its not working?\n\nBut on the matter of the concept being similar, this I have no idea what you mean. Bathing Ape brands everything, whereas this brand is very much about simplicity, actually its concept is so completely the opposite of Bathing Ape. Please explain how you see the two concepts in a similar way?\n\n"

Both icons have a similar high contrast/silhouette look. I'm not accussing you of copying in any way, but I don't want you to unknowingly lead your client into potential legal trouble with BAPE.\n\n"
