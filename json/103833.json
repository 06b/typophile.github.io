  "content": "In 2008 _TypeTogether_ released the [Bree](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree) typeface, a sleek sans serif that quickly became a favorite among brand and editorial designers.\n\n[Bree Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif) follows the same theme as its predecessor. It is a young and energetic upright italic that approaches readers with hip and somewhat elegant charm. It has a range of styles that can perform as counterparts to the original [Bree](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree) fonts. At the same time though they bring a whole range of new and individual features that make [Bree Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif) a separate type family in its own right.\n\nThe characters in [Bree Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif) maintain the original flavour of handwriting, but have a more subtle appearance to support optimal editorial usage. The slabby nature of its shapes, particularly in the heavier weights, makes for a strong impression.\n\nSome of the characteristic features of its sans serif cousin are present in [Bree Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif) too, such as the single-story ‘a’, the cursive ‘e’ and the rhythmical ‘k’ and ‘y’. Alternate letters of these are also available when a more neutral look is desired.\n\n[Bree Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif) offers a mixture of fluid and attractive forms that convey a contemporary and vivid aspect. If you loved the multi- award wining [Bree](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree), you will surely love its seriffed cousin!\n\nDesigned by _José Scaglione_ and _Veronika Burian_.\n\nMore information: [Bree Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/www.type-together.com/Bree%20Serif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [breeserif.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/typophile.com/files/breeserif.jpg) | 37.78 KB |\n| [breeserif2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/typophile.com/files/breeserif2.jpg) | 70.8 KB |\n| [breeserif3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/typophile.com/files/breeserif3.jpg) | 41.6 KB |\n| [breeserif4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/typophile.com/files/breeserif4.jpg) | 73.6 KB |\n| [breeserif5.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/typophile.com/files/breeserif5.jpg) | 95.82 KB |\n| [breeserif6.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121953/http:/typophile.com/files/breeserif6.jpg) | 72.3 KB |\n\n",
