  "content": "Hello!  \nThis is to let you know of my second font release called Silent Alternates.\n\nSilent Alternates born from the deconstruction of Silent Light, resulting in a most impressive typeface.  \nIdeal for use in large sizes, such as posters, titles and is an alternative to italics. It can be used to highlight some words in conjunction with Silent Light.\n\nHope you like it.\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/danieljusti/silent-alternates/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819032946/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/danieljusti/silent-alternates/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/danieljusti/silent-alternates/\")\n\nThanks for your time. Feedback’s apreciated.  \nBest regards!\n\nJusti  \nhttp://www.danieljusti.com\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819032946im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2_4756.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819032946im_/http:/typophile.com/files/4_5824.png)\n\n",
