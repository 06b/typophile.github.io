Now also at WhatTheFont again I was pointed to Times New Roman, though having been replied there that it “looks condensed by hand rather than original condensed design (serifs are deformed)”.\n\nThus again I’d truly appreciate also your views over it please and thank you so much already for any further enlightenment.\n\n(And yet I’m sorry that some of the letters in the image provided are not as legible, but unfortunately I couldn’t make a better scan of them... :/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222005028im_/http:/typophile.com/files/surrender_6168.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Ferrell International logo - ITC Serif Gothic {Yves, Patrick Broderick}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222005028/http:/typophile.com/node/19678 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) 3D3 stright angled script - similar to FIG Script, Gretel {Stephen} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222005028/http:/typophile.com/node/19661 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
