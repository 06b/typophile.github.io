To do this, I have invented   \nthe Papercut Press. (Inspired while using   \nthe guillotine at work). Naturally, Papercut   \nhas to have a logo, so I have made a few   \nvariations. What do you all think?   \n   \nkris.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023154644im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42849.gif)\n\n",

Have you tried it as a black mark with the outline reversed out?   \nI like the 4th variation also, although the combination of letters might be read as 'dp'.\n\n"

      "content": "impo,the logo could be siplified and abstrated more. Right know it communicates the name just fine however it dosn't tell me anything more.(on an abstract level). Also right know it feels more like an illustration than a logo. My gut also tells me the logo should be more sharp and severe. All the way down to the typography. I tend to think of where this logo might be used. I don't feel like it would hold up on the spine of book at a very small size. The PP ligature looks like dp. The typeface is actually pretty nice come to think of it.\n\n"

Number one works the best for me, with the stronger stroke on the symbol it should still look good printed at smaller sizes.   \nThe other concept with the PP ligature is lacking the spirit of the first ones.   \n   \nGreat work.\n\n"
