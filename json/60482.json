      "content": "Thanks, people.\n\nWell, my good old CS3 had the 3D \"Bevel & Extrude\" function in the Filter menu. But it got dropped in CS4.\n\nI am definitely looking for a quick one-shot way to do this. I guess Illustrator is the way to go. :-( What is sad is that it is still just the same old crappy tool, but now I gotta go back and forth to get it right.\n\nI did find an Electric Rain \"Swift 3D\" plugin that will do this -- and I'm sure it is a vast improvement over the old Adobe 3D Filter. But Swift 3D is $150 and... well, I've got Illustrator... so I guess I just have to regress my method. Oh well.\n\n"
