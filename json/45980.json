This semi-formal script has a definite mid-century European flavor suitable for menus, invitations and poster work. Along with the accurate rendition of the regular weight, designer Colin Kahn has added a lighter companion font for another variation on Cigno. Both fonts feature a full Western European character set.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/cigno.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608221122/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/cigno.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/cigno.html\")\n\nBuy the set of 2 fonts for $29.95. No, scratch that. For the first month, weâ€™ll offer both fonts for the price of 1- only $19.95. OK, now you have to buy them! Offer good until June 30, 2008\n\n",
