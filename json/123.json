I say don't fix what ain't broken.   \n   \nthem's fightin' words! fugazi's new (year-old by now) album is arguably their best. deep, beautiful, aggressive, raw, organic, etc. or did you mean you liked it? all of fugazi's stuff is in constant consideration when the cd player door opens. in high school when i signed year books with ff i meant fugazi forever. well, not really, but you get the point. also, i just got the decline ep by nofx. brilliant work from a bunch of lazy slobs. in my printing practicum class we listened to whole bunch of music that my mother would be shocked to know i was listening to, like tomahawk (completely out of hand), a little band from suburban chicago called big'un, another out of control band called new brutalism, and this wicked cool canadian band called shotmaker. i still have a headache from it (it had to be loud to be heard over the a.b. dick). probably no one cares about this old string anymore, but there you have it anyway.\n\n"
