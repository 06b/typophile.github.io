  "content": "Hello there,\n\nI'm trying to find the subtitle font(s) used in the Italian theatrical version of \"Star Wars\" (around 1978). The attached images show a few shots of it. To me it looks like a mix of letters from both Gill Sans and Johnston... but I'm not sure. Is there possibly a single font that represents this?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [gr\\_it\\_1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620204510/http:/typophile.com/files/gr_it_1.png) | 564.29 KB |\n| [gr\\_it\\_2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620204510/http:/typophile.com/files/gr_it_2.png) | 570.66 KB |\n| [gr\\_it\\_3.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620204510/http:/typophile.com/files/gr_it_3.png) | 529.88 KB |\n\n",
