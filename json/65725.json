It will help of you tell us more about what you like in Fovea.\n\nSome of its serifs are like those mentioned above, but it’s skeleton is more [FF Milo](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103013158/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_milo_serif_ot_medium/).\n\n"

Let me think about it i guess. Thanks for the help!!!\n\n"

You could pay full price but be entitled to the final version upon completion. And Mark might appreciate the feedback from real-world usage, which would help improve the final product. I’ve actually done this myself as a type designer.\n\nhhp\n\n"
