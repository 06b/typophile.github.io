Maybe sometimes there is even more than one possible pronounciation. There are special dictionaries for Japanese names, and if it's important to get it right, I'd recommend to consult one of these dictionaries.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's a film, maybe you can find the romanizised names somewhere on the internet, then you don't need to translate them.\n\n"
