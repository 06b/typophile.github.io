  "content": "Hi Everyone:\n\nI have been working on a new script similar to Fugu. Where Fugu was very relaxed and informal, there is a bit of attitude with Nori. It is a bit more expressive,\n\nmuch more activity and movement with the brush this time—each lowercase letter has at least 2 alternates if not more, each uppercase letter has an oversized more energetic alternate. I am at the point in my process where I start compiling my selection of ligatures...some I have already brushed out, some I will compile digitally and others I will go back and produce... I started with the usual suspects but wanted to keep it unique and thought I could turn it over to the type-obsessed community for suggestions and advice... to make it more fun, I thought I'd offer up a free license of the completed font to a randomly selected 'contributor' through, twitter, facebook and typophile forums...\n\nBear in mind, I am completely open to suggestions regarding the look, feel, flow of this typeface.\n\nI will supply a few screenshots, please let me know what you think and what you would like to see.\n\nThanks\n\nNeil\n\nI am including attachments of the primary and alternative character set and a small passage set in the primary character set.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [nori1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107224228/http:/typophile.com/files/nori1_0.jpg) | 196.21 KB |\n| [nori2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107224228/http:/typophile.com/files/nori2_0.jpg) | 110.01 KB |\n| [nori4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107224228/http:/typophile.com/files/nori4_0.jpg) | 133.25 KB |\n| [nori3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107224228/http:/typophile.com/files/nori3_0.jpg) | 138.33 KB |\n\n",

Even though I know contextual alternates could handle much of this, I am not confident in the available applications out there fully supporting calt.\n\nthanks again!\n\n"
