  "content": "I’m looking for a non-Clarendon (read the “I saw Clarendon on 9 magazines post”) slab serif to use for display type. Something that is not too “western” —I’m not looking to brand anything with it. Something that maybe has a historic edge to it—nothing too modern (along the lines of Dispatch or Apex). It needs to be a square serif as it is being paired in the design with a traditional serif and I want there to be distinction between the two. Has to have an extra bold and/or heavy weight.\n\nthanks for any suggestions!\n\n [‹ Design Based on Sports Team Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20071113055916/http:/typophile.com/node/33410 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Hevetica vs. Univers ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071113055916/http:/typophile.com/node/33301 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Plus, as far as magazines go, I’ve seen Dispatch and Caecilia too much in use. Looking for something a little more obscure.\n\n"
