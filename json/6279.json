I don't want to use _Lorem Ipsum_, and _the quick brown fox..._ is a bit too short.   \nWhat would you choose, which are the standard sample texts in english?   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \n   \n�\n\n",

If so, it might have value for presentation.   \n   \nSince your purpose is publication, however, I think you should look for a passage that suits your fancy in some classic public domain text, a chidren's book or a classic of travel writing, for example. Take it as an opportunity to put some of your own personality into the project.\n\n"

The idea of using Lorem ipsum is that it might make the presentation look better than the reality. Or so I've heard said.   \n   \nBut that's not an idea I like. Personally I use my own dummy nonsense text or else some literary text.\n\n"
