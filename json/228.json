  "content": "Just curious --- what is the difference between   \nNeue Helvetica & Helvetica. This is the info at linotype   \n   \n\"Over the years, Helvetica was expanded to include many different weights, but these were not coordinated with each other.In 1983, D. Stempel AG redesigned and digitized the \"Neue Helvetica\" typeface for Linotype and made it a self-contained font family. Today, this family consists of 51 different font weights.\"   \n   \nJust curious why there is a nearly $250.00 price difference between the two packages.............\n\n",

      "content": "$250 package of Neue Helvetica will have 51 variations in weight and width, from narrow to extended. Unlike Helvetica, Neue Helvetica family has consistent design throughout. Helvetica had been copied and redesigned and over and over again so that it doesn't really have consistent style anymore. For example, Helvetica will probably come with Helvetica Narrow, but the design of Helvetica Narrow should really be considered different font...   \n   \nI'm really an anti-Helvetica and anti-swiss style, but if I have to use Helvetica, I use Neue, because its elegant and refined design shows that the I care about choice of typography, and I didn't just pick Helvetica because it came with your mac.\n\n"

Big huge maps of the U.S. with goofy, pathetic Comic Sans spelling out \"RAIN\" \"LOW PRESSURE ZONE,\" the temperatures, etc. As bad as the letters look, I think the numbers look even worse. They superimpose giant numbers next to the weatherman to indicate \"today's high temperature\" and it looks like Comic Sans figures that are about nine feet high. Truly awful. It looks like psychotic children have taken over the place!\n\n"

I think this discussion   \nis somewhat irrelevant, as you can't argue about taste.   \nI still think DJ Anzai's entry made truckloads of sense.   \n   \nArguments about the intrinsic artistic qualities of type designs   \nonly go as far as till you reach the point where personal   \ntaste comes into play. _De gustibus et coloribus_ yadda yadda...   \n   \nJay, if you like Helvetica: good for you. Tracy, if you   \ndislike Helvetica, good for you too. If everybody liked the   \nsame typeface, there'd be only one, and that'd make me   \nvery unhappy (err... actually... let me think. In that case   \nI would also only like that same typeface, so I wouldn't   \nknow any better. Which means I would _not_ be unhappy,   \non the contrary! Ouch, head hurtz... ;) )   \n   \nLet me finish my entry with two quotes which had a profound   \ninfluence on my practice as a [typo]graphic designer:   \n   \n**One can make a beautiful design with an ugly typeface.**   \nWolfgang Weingart   \n   \n**There are no bad typefaces, only bad typographers.**   \nMr. Jeffrey Keedy   \n   \n   \nThere _is_ a point to be made about Comic Sans, though... =D\n\n"
