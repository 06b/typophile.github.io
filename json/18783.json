Right now I’m looking at Trajan, Requim, and Penumbra. The artwork features handrawn plum blossoms so if I could find an elegant match that suggests an asian feel that would be great. Thanks for any recommends...  \nAM\n\n [‹ (x) Church-y, gothic geometric sans with crossed \"O\" - Exocet {Dav}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063241/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18778 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [PLEASE HELP, suggestion for a script face ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063241/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18721 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The blossoms will be made perfect once I decide on just one or two bunches. Please weigh-in on which is working better.  \nI should mention the invite will be letterpressed. The colors are silver for the border, some peony pink for the flowers and names, and a brown for text.  \nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063241im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/ONE.jpg)\n\n"

I’m not in love with the grey border, maybe it could be a little lighter either in tint or in weight.\n\nWhy does Barry get a “Mr.”?\n\nHave you considered an ampersand between the names? Dear Sarah has a nice one.\n\nand of course congratulations.\n\n"
