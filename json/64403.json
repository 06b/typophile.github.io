He sent me a book title and a pic from the font.\n\nI think it could be a PostScript font. Primafont offered a Basel, but I do not think, its this one. Am I right or not? Can someone help me?\n\nGeorg\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101111415im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Basel%20Schrift_5016.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101111415im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Schriftbuch_4139.jpg)\n\n",

Akira, that was a good find to recognize Kellie Ann as the same typeface.
