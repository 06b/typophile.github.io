      "content": "The yen symbol was invented overseas by Western journalists who needed a symbol to use in financial articles. At the time, typewriters were the main writing tool in use, so something that could easily be typed — a Y followed by a backspace and a hyphen or equal sign — became the convention. Thus, there is no official description of ¥ any more than there is an official description for $ or @ or &.\n\nIn Japan itself, the ¥ is not used terribly often, being essentially a Latin typographic symbol; and it does not appear on currency. Instead, the ideogram 円 is used. This character also means \"circle\" and has the same origin as the character for the Chinese yuan.\n\nIncidentally, \"dollar\" can be written 弗 in Japanese, a rather clever innovation since it is otherwise rarely used and resembles a dollar sign.\n\n"
