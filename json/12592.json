As for the tightness issue I mentioned, I meant that I think you should keep it slightly tight overall (partly because the color is darkish).\n\nMainstream versus idiosyncratic color: at any given time in type design history, most designers will have a preference for lighter or darker fonts. In the Middle Ages people liked dark fonts, while in the 70s they liked very light fonts. That's been moving more towards dark lately, but some people (like Fred Smeijers) still prefer a color that's darker than most other designers agree is good. I like darkish fonts too. A designer can justify a preference for something outside the mainstream either by simply saying that's the way he likes it (not too hot), or by believing that users benefit (very good).\n\nhhp\n\n"

One thing that stuck out to my eye was that there was not enough space on the left side of the lowercase a. It looks fine now.\n\nSome things I'm seeing in the new version:\n\nCertain characters--the A, a, G, s, V, 4, for example--look slightly bolder than the rest. It's not just these characters, but those are the ones that stand out to me.\n\nThe X appears to lean to the left, and there is too much space on its right side (or the left side of the Y).\n\nThe curve on the bowl of the R is too thin.\n\nI liked your previous non-connecting fi and fl ligatures better. It's traditional, but I don't think it necessarily makes sense to connect the characters in a sans serif. You're really just trying to correct the problem of the f colliding with other characters. Connecting the characters is not the only way to do this.\n\nI think you need to spend more time with the ampersand. I can't tell for sure from your sample, but I would guess that you have drawn it with the counters as separate paths. During development, you don't have to draw your characters this way. You can make one continuous path with overlapping elements. That way, you get a nice flow to the strokes. You can remove the overlaps anytime before you generate the fonts. I do it as one of the last steps.\n\n"

Most notably, this applies to basic things like the round overshoot of the \"o\" (as explained by Harry Carter in his translation of Fournier). What size is this design meant for?

      "content": "André,\n\nMostly, the color is not uniform enough yet. The a, e, and g are dark spots. You may have to decrease the horizontals in those glyphs and open the counters a bit (Look hard at the upper bowl of the g.). I think your horizontal strokes overall need to be optically adjusted thinner. Remember, you are trying to give the appearance of monoline, you are not actually making it measured as monoline. This shows up most as the size gets smaller. If you intend this to be a text face, it is more of an issue. You may also consider putting some traps in to make it optically balanced in weight. In some cases, I can't tell if it is a metrics problem that contributes to unevenness but I think it is as well. I would decrease the sidebearings on curved sides of glyphs like b, d, p, q. At this stage, I would not set samples justified, stick with ragged right for the moment. It is too hard to separate out what spacing issues are due to your justification algorithm and which are inherent to your metrics.  \nSet an \"nu\" necklace (nuanubnucnudnuenuf...) and then an \"o\" necklace (oaobocodoeofogohoio...) to test your sidebearings. Leave kerning off. Print strings of these at text sizes and make adjustments to sidebearings until the color is even. If you cannot get even color with this setting, it indicates that some of the glyphs need adjustment. Those will stick out like the g does now. This is a difficult stage. For me, the first drawing of the glyphs is quick. The longer time is spent going back and forth with spacing and glyph adjustments to turn a set of glyphs into a harmonious family.  \nI think you have to be sure you are consistent in spacing as well. Look at page 2 column 2 at the word \"playwright\" and then at the word \"works\" on the next line. Look at the \"ri\" and then the \"rk\" The r seems farther from the i than it does to the k.  \nMostly, just keep at it. You will get a good result for your efforts. I think it is coming along well. You just need to push through the hard part. You will see. I am confident you will end up with a good typeface for your efforts.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Instead, I would: put less weight in the head, as well as the join between the head and lower bowl; and put more weight into the left side of the lower bowl. The UC \"S\": bad curves throughout. The florin: should slant. The Brit Pound: smaller head. Quotes: too much stroke contrast.\n\nThe cap height: I think it's too close to the ascender height.  \nI would either make them the same, or more clearly different.\n\nThe traps: I think they're cool, but inconsistent.

I don't think he invented it though. It was probably a long-standing calligraphy thing.  \nArnold had us do many n and o necklaces as practice for calligraphy. It was more about developing consistency in writing than measuring side-bearings. It seemed like a good term and it stuck with me low these many years.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

You might consider longer sections of text in different languages to see the different letter combinations that come up and may need attention. In case you are not already aware of it, a good site to find multilingual text is the United Nations Human Rights Charter which has the text set in many languages.
