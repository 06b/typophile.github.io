  "content": "I have just starting playing with FL's MM feature. (FL 4.5) It is almost working, but I am having a few problems. I am only using a single axis - weight - and only have two masters per glyph. So, a few quick questions:   \n   \nIs it possible to delete the outline of one master without deleting the other?   \n   \nIf so, can I just paste another outline to the master?   \n   \nIs it possilble to define Startpoints on both masters? I am getting some screwy interpolated results, and I think it is because the startpoints on the two master outlines are in completely different places. When I define it for one master, it automatically changes the other master. grrr.   \n   \nany answers would be much appreciated.   \n   \nkris.\n\n",

      "content": "You have to remember that once you have created the masters, they behave as a single glyph in the glyph window. Delete a Point on one, and it will be deleted on the other. It goes the same for start point.   \n   \nHopefully you have one or more of the masters still existing as single fonts.   \n   \nChange the start point of the Glyph of the single font so it is harmony with one of the start points of the troublesome MM glyph. Use Assign Mask to place the new altered font to the mask layer, and they use Mask to Master to Replace the Master that is out of sorts.   \n   \nIf I have increased your confusion, I apologize.   \nFontLab 4.6 is a little easier to use in this regard.\n\n"
