Always amazing.\n\nA friend emailed some PNGs of a face she’s working on—very fresh and multi-dimensional. So I’m sitting here at the kitchen table with a large “A” on my laptop and in the distance, in my field of vision is Tom Geismar’s “Z” poster.\n\nSo I’m wondering, what is it about letterforms, that psychological something, that’s so evocative?\n\n [‹ Baseline Grid](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154254/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32509 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for Frutiger's arrows ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154254/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32501 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
