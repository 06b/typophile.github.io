William's eloquence in praise of Jenson is also very persuasive.   \n   \nSteve, one thing about using a modern typeface: due to the unique nature of the medium, in which type is superimposed or woven into the images, it would look somewhat jarring (IMO) for a modern typeface to be juxtaposed with images of Renaissance Florence. The comics medium is what demands of me an approach to text which complements my approach to imagery.   \n   \nI refuse to use the common \"comics\" fonts in this piece, as those emerged as the type of choice for children's adventure comics, and are more appropriate for that genre.

First, this is first and foremost a catalog of bibliographic descriptions. It is secondarily a book about Aldus. A typeface was needed, any typeface, that had a workable Greek, Latin, roman. By workable I mean we would need \"on a discovery\" basis, \"every\" G/L/r letterform that existed as incunabular (including those that no longer exist) as well as any G/L/r letterform that was currently of use in the twentieth century. Matthew was our only choice. Not only as a designer but as a knowledgable historian of type. At the time there was no italic for the Miller and that would have to be developed as well. \"He\" named the face Manutius in honor of the project and for no other reason. This particular configuration of the Miller/Wilson face no longer exists as it was developed solely for use in this project.   \n   \nI've found that bibliographic descriptions, dictionaries, etc, go a bit beyond their subject matter and are bibliographically considered a subject in themselves. They are certainly categorized that way in every library system that I know of.   \n   \nRB, as I recall from an email he sent to me, was a bit more emotional about this than he now claims. He also felt my use of Miller for a faux nineteenth-century book about Gutenberg was wrong as obviously anything about Gutenberg should be set in a blackletter. His latching on to subject matter prevented him from seeing the structure that existed beyond the subject matter, a nineteenth century interpretation, a bibliographic description catalog.   \n   \nNo incunabular or Renaissance form can adequately provide the legibility/readability needs that would be required in printed matter where such concerns are paramount. Early forms that existed before these historical concerns raised their ugly little heads are often inadequate. Every interpretation of these early forms runs into this problem.\n\n"

This is the treatment that I used in the prologue, when Machiavelli descibes the Pazzi conspiracy in a manuscript.   \n2) Adobe Jenson italic for excerpts from published works and captions that are not written by Machiavelli   \n3) A handwritten Jenson Italic for dialogue.

This book is unlike those in execution, but similar in aims: to use comics as a medium to tell a complex story with a desire to be artistically innovative as well.
