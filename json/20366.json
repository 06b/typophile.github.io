  "content": "i need help. are any of these directions working for anyone?\n\ni'm having a heck of a time finding a visual that embodies the word champfactory--at least a visual that is uncluttered, and holds its color well. think either addidas logo, nike or apple--simple, curvy blocks of color.\n\nthe product is a card game based on motorcycle racing that has been developed over time to embody many different types of racing, although its still motor-sport based as opposed to say, track and field.\n\nso, i can try to create something illustrative of an actual factory that pumps out winners, or i can simply go for an illustration of winning, or speed, or strength, or other attributes of a champion.\n\nthis graphic is not coming easily to me, and i've ruled out trying to make a wordmark due to the sheer length of the name. it may be time for me to put it down and come back later with a clean slate.\n\nany ideas, anyone?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [11.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415095546/http:/typophile.com/files/11.png) | 5.61 KB |\n| [12.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415095546/http:/typophile.com/files/12.png) | 10.96 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I think 7 and 8 have speed but the winning is a bit obscured by the 1, I think if you are going to distort a character you should begin with a more usual\\* one. I might try using a non-oblique wordmark, because the impression of speed in photography is increased by having a stationary object in the foreground. Further to Hrant's suggestions you might think of a chequered flag which is probably more universal and can be made into a powerful graphic, along the lines of the simple logos you mentioned.  \nTim\n\n\\*bit subjective but I hope you take my point\n\n"

      "content": "The Id needs alot more than a logo. You could do anything with a mark like that and it would mean nothing. I think your client needs to think about branding not just a mark. What is it that they are selling or bringing to market? Get a marketing report or make them generate one for you. You need a point of reference to start from, like who are you talking to!\n\n"
