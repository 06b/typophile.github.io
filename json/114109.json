Is it Chrome rendering? Is it some configuration I should tweak? Any help is welcome!  \nI've just checked that UTF-8 was selected in Chrome codification, and it was. Strangly I can see more symbols in IE 11 (!)\n\n",

I have noticed this happening on rare but frequent enough occasions where a startlingly different font appears where there is a recently introduced glyph, like capital sharp S or one of the newer currency symbols that many common fonts haven't yet been updated to support.\n\nIf you don't have any installed fonts with those characters, they won't show up. If you do have at least one such font installed, your software may make the substitution automatically, or you might have to make a settings adjustment.\n\n"
