  "content": "Hello friends.\n\nI've been using Garamond Premier Pro quite a bit lately - a wonderful face, I love having the whole set consolidated, and while the Greek has not yet been helpful, the Cyrillic has been.\n\nHowever, I just noticed that for some odd reason the titling face that is part of our old Adobe Garamond set is not part of Premier Pro. Is there a reason for this? I would think that the very fact that \"titling alternates\" is an opentype choice in Indesign would be reason enough to include it, since the titling caps were, after all, an Adobe face (weren't they?) ... Or am I missing something?\n\nWhat is the story, Adobe? I was hoping to replace my entire Adobe Garamond with the new face, but now I see I have to have two versions on my system, which is kind of a pain in the butt. Will there be a 2.0 release which will integrate the titling face?\n\nYour friend and mine,\n\nJLT\n\n",

      "content": "Joshua,\n\nThe \"titling set\" is included in the Garamond Premier Pro family. The Display fonts form the \"titling set\" you're looking for. This optical size is an adaptation of Garamond's (the metal type) _Gros Canon_.\n\nAs for Adobe Garamond, this typeface was designed many years ago (1989) under significant technological restrictions (e.g. at the time there was a limit to the number of nodes that each glyph could contain, before crashing a printer, for example). The whole family was modeled on Garamond's _Parangonne_ and Granjon's _St Augustin_. The titling set you see on this family is the result of Robert's first take (Minion is the another example) at making optical size designs.\n\nThe whole story is in Garamond Premier Pro's printed specimen. Can you get a hold of it?\n\n"
