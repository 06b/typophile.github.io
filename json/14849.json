First, you can answer the question, how tall is the EM either by typing an H and a return and an H with 0 leading, or count pixels from baseline to baseline any way you can. If you are working on the Mac, (72 dpi), your pixel count is the same as your point size, (or close enough). If not, your formula is: Pixels per Em = resolution/72 X points and you can rearrange it several ways depending on the variable you’re seeking…but because Nearly all fonts on all Windows driven screens are fractional point sizes, type is only approximately a point size there.\n\n"

If they use a style sheet as they should, it may not even be available to you.  \nThe big wiz is that browsers, monitors, video cards, and system configurations vary all over the place. Typographic point size is meaningless on the web. The best you can do is count pixels and that only works for one set-up. Set your monitor to a higher rez and it is out the window. This is why controlling typography on web sites is such a royal pain to attempt.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "” (72dpi is a bit of a myth by the way)”  \nYes. All screen resolution, and point size(s) there put, is/are a bit of a myth, but there are always ways of turning the mythical sizes into a number of actual pixels, and, unless there is a .5000000 remainder no longer in evidence, actual pixels can be turned into mythical points, through the mythical resolution, be it Mac or WinTel.\n\nIf you want to blow away the myths, you \\*just\\* need to measure, with a ruler, the actual area occupied by a screen’s full capacity, then use the “Displays” control panel or its kin, to get the pixels displayed across and down, e.g. 1600 x 1024, dividing that into the measure you just made and you have the actual dpi. THEN, you need to know the dpi being used by the OS, and the number of points the OS thinks there is in an inch, and then you can figure out, depending on whether you’re looking for pixels or points, what’s what, including, if you can, specifying a fractional point size that wil get you an ACTUAL, e.g. 12 pt.\n\nThe part(s) that cause(s) the mythic shroud is that the OS does not know the actual size of the screen(s)’s writable area(s), and the device manufacturers lie about resolution. This issue was almost solvable at Apple until another choice was made, and MS, (where the myth of point size is additionally murked by a resolution guaranteed to leave remainders, and as unruly a herd of device makers as is possible), was lobbied to improve this in Longhorn coming, but they only got to 1/2 of it.\n\nThe results of this are a sad lack of truth to the terms “actual size” and “100%”, not to mention, 10 point, but ‘eh’, you can’t have it all…\n\n"

(I guess strictly rather than dpi the measure is pixels per nominal text inch)\n\nIt will be much more of an issue when display resolution increases significantly.\n\nWhen I said 72dpi was a myth I had in mind 2 issues:\n\n(1) it’s too often used when it really isn’t relevant, for example the old chestnut of scanning an image at 72dpi because it’s for on screen use\n\n(2) all the displays I’ve used in the last few years have been closer to 90dpi anyway.\n\n"

It just cares about the number of pixels. A browser will use an arbitrary DPI conversion, though, for renderin type spec’d in a print measurement. These days, that’s typically 96PPI on both Macs and PCs.\n\n"
