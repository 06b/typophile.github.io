  "content": "A punctuation mark and sometimes a diacritic mark, in Latin fonts and languages. In English it has two main functions: it marks omissions, and it assists in marking the possessives of all nouns and many pronouns.\n\nThe **apostrophe** differs from the closing single quotation mark, often rendered identically but serving a different purpose. In limited casesit is allowed to assist in marking plurals, but most authorities now disapprove of such usage.\n\nAccording to the OED, the word comes ultimately from Greek ἡ ἀπόστροφος [προσῳδία] (hē apóstrophos [prosōidía], the (accent of \"turning away\", or elision), through Latin and French.\n\n",
