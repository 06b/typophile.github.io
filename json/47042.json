  "content": "Hey, i am brand new to this website and this forum. So please be nice!  \nI started a clothing company around 18 months ago. But i have had many comments saying its not clear to read the typeface and that the ’r’ looks like 2 letters instead of one. So i have decided to totally re-design it.\n\nThe thing is i forked out for photoshop cs3 extended about 8 weeks but to be honest don’t have a clue where to start really.\n\ni know that my old logo looked a bit childish i want the new one to look more professional.\n\ni really like the font gill sans mt condensed and was wondering if you bright sparks could give me some good alternatives.\n\nalso if you good give me some ideas on layout and things like that, it would be very much appreciated.\n\nbelow i have put and example of the past logo.\n\n[http://i29.tinypic.com/2lx8il4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828032549/http:/i29.tinypic.com/2lx8il4.jpg \"http://i29.tinypic.com/2lx8il4.jpg\")\n\nplease ANY help is very much appreciated!\n\nthe color scheme i want to be very neutral\n\nthanks\n\n [‹ Font composed of mostly parallel lines of equal length](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828032549/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47097 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [creating different text effects ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828032549/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47128 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "For starters, I’d suggest using vector-based software (ie Illustrator) to design your logo—or at least to produce it. If you’re logo is vector you’ll have no issues separating it for film (for silkscreening) or blowing it up to go on a billboard.\n\nAs for your old logo, I think the childish look has a lot to do with the bubbly letters, and the primary colours. Go ahead and use Gill Condensed and some neutral colours and you’re already miles ahead of your old logo.\n\nOf course these are very basic suggestions... you should really consider who you’re trying to appeal to and go from there.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nEric\n\n"

It seems like you’ve done it just because you can.\n\nWhy don’t you forget about the computer for a bit and try drawing some ideas? The computer can too easily dictate what you make. And like Eric said, the primary colours don’t look good.\n\nKeep on it, you’ll come up with something!\n\n-Rafe\n\n"

Then it’s drawing around that.\n\nJoel Santos // youremin  \nsound & visual\n\n"

If it’s more of a “cute” or “stylish” type clothing company, look to a more feminine look than you have designed. Check Veer for fonts like Affair or Loving Acts.\n\n"
