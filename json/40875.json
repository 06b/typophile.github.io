I think other faces may have a bit more flexibility in that regard. Not that it’s a bad thing at all, just that it is something to bear in mind if you’re planning to use it extensively or if your layout has narrow columns; fitting copy is going to depend more on editing the language of the text than fudging with kerning and leading.\n\n"
