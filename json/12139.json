Morris was a letterer, type designer, printer, and book maker who sought to revive Renaissance humanism in the arts and the medieval system of artists' guilds, in explicit reaction to the increasing industrialization of English society. Founded The [Kelmscott Press](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010192235/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Kelmscott%20Press). Designed many types for that press, and specialized in a kind of idealized Renaissance design, heavily ornamented, densely set, and very difficult to read, although easy to admire. Inspired [Dard Hunter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010192235/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Dard%20Hunter) and the other exponents of the American Arts & Crafts movement.\n\n",
