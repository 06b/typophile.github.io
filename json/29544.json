  "content": "I have been asked to provide a rough estimate for the design and production of a 40 page soft back book. The publication will be an architect's monograph to be sent to clients and potentially sold in select bookstores.\n\nWe are currently getting quotes from printers for between 2-10,000 copies, and I'm really just curious what others would (very roughly) charge for the design of a project of this kind.\n\nThank you, Ed\n\n",

Does not include picture research, scanning, retouching art, or dealing with the printer.\n\nSo I'd say for a book that short about $2000. But be sure to make them understand it's only one round of layout changes.\n\n"

Give the bugger a quote with provisions for them to muck around being stupid making arbitraty changes so charge $ 150 hour or whatever for changes. Think about how long it will take tou to design up a grid, talk to printer,s deal with tthe clients shit and nake an hourly rate that you think will keep you happy. If you end up doing the job for less than yiou are happy with then you will hate it forever and they will take the piss.\n\nMy mate is a painter, he said they alway quoted a job buy thinnkng of a figure, doulbe it and add 30 percent!\n\nMuzz\n\n"

I have a good relationship with the architect in charge of the project, however there is the terrible possibility of it going to committee, so i will be allowing for acres of revisions in my quote.\n\nWe really want the job, as it may well lead to further work, inevitably it's a delicate balancing act; both wanting to give the appearance of a serious outfit and at the same time producing a competitive quote.\n\nThanks again you have all been very helpful.\n\nEd\n\n"

Or did you mean \"between two thousand copies and ten thousand copies\"? If it is the latter, digital printing is probably out of the question. Digital printing, in the right shop, is getting very good. But there are not enough \"right shops\" around yet.\n\nNot that this has much reflection on the basic design fee. But it may have some bearing on your fee for dealing with the printer, who will probably need to show you several sheets and talk about the cost variables among them.\n\npatty's price structure is a good place to start thinking about this. But, I, too, worry about what kind of swamp you may be getting into here. I do not mean to bash anyone, but very often clients who are not accustomed to publishing book-like things don't really understand all that this means. They very often need close attention and forthright direction so they may do their jobs with as little pain all around.\n\n"
