I have some others not previously mentioned, with Part 5 page numbers in parentheses:   \nCountryhouse (p.1), Whimsey (p.1), Giddyup (p.2), Yellow (p.3), Tuscarora (p.4), Riva (p.6), Katfish (p.6), Ligeia (p.6), Marguerita (p.7), Swank (p.21), A Yummy Apology (p.22), Pizzicato (p.23), Hollyweird (p.26), Amelie (p.27) and OhLey (p.29)   \n   \nThe bad news is that none are an exact match, although OhLey is very similar.\n\n",
