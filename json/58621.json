      "content": "a domain name being available is (IMO) one of the weakest reasons for selecting a name. Using QuotAngel as an example ... it conjurs images of \"quotation angels\" which (to me at least) makes no sense.  \nSurely you can find a better name, and th edomain doesn't have to be the company name, it can be a related phrase, or unrealted phrase/word ... just make it memorable.\n\nAs for the mark ... it's got potential I particularly like the reference to programming - the core difference between games. In the examples you've provided the mark overshadows the text and won't work at realistic text sizes (for quotes etc.)\n\nWithout wanting to burst your bubble too much, I think you've approached the thing a bit arse about - i.e, developing identity/branding treatments without thinking the core message through.\n\n:)\n\nSo with all that said ... enlighten us, what's the company about? what's on offer? what's it going to do? what difference will it make? who will it make a difference to? how will it communicate?\n\n----------  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Graphic Designer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419155220/http:/www.solid-creative.com/) - Melbourne\n\n"

      "content": "In the company we are five, one designer/developper (me), one 3D specialist and better developper than me, one dialogue writer and humorist, tow specialist/writer of role playing game since they play every rpg/strategy game that existe starting with the table game more than 25 years ago. We will make first games for iphone. One of our goal is to buy a licence of a french comics, humoristic, sort of futuristic Improssible Mission with losers, and make some 3-4 hours episode of some adventure/rpg fun games we sell like 5$ each episode. but before that we have two other games i can't tell about (because it's someting new and exciting )except that they could need a lot of bandwith for live fight and we have the right partner for that. So right now technically speaking everything is going well. We will also have an gameplay advantage but cant tell about because of the patent process. Another thing, our main target i to gently make casual gamers come to the world of hardcore gamers, our games will  \nbe progressive enough not to affraid casual gamers, and gently evolve for someting more evolved/hardcore trough a learning curve sytem.\n\nSo i have to find another name, but i love this logo i want to keep it. So i think i will call the others to make a brainstorming, i we need/want to the word 'angel' is needed or whatever, maybe 'flyingcoders' would be better, i just don't know.\n\nThe quotation mark thing is only for use in Title, big size (the text will be bigger and the quotation smaller and i don't think  \nthe ending quote will be the logo, i think i'll snap the head, it's too much)  \nright now this is the very beginning of the communication process and i think we will focus more on communicating about the games we will make than about the company's communication who will be more... i dont know (we have the knowledge and competence to do a 3D flash website it would be a shame not to do it for ourselve, but what's the story/message would be, again  \ntoday i don't know)\n\n"

But it's maybe naive. i have made a new version with only quote and quote being a lot smaller, i think it's looks good, but the usage maybe improved.\n\n@epslicon: i agree, i shouldn't publish a first draft like that, i've made change. The loading/busy animation of ps3 is a round blurred thing right ?\n\n"

The new concept is base on the movie \"Brazil\"  \n(if you know the movie - you should, it's a masterpiece - and remember the dreams of a flying man)  \nand were working on a Flash site with realtime 3D of this flying man.\n\nBut this is the logo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419155220im_/http:/typophile.com/files/momad_5689.jpg)\n\n"

I understand your explanation, but I think for a logo it's just too much of a stretch. For me, the meaning and intent of a logo should be pretty obvious, and this just isn't. And even if the intent is for the consumer to put some thought into divining its meaning, I feel that the payoff just isn't there.\n\n"
