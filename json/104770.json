  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am trying to ID a font for a friend and am at a complete loss. The font in question is that of the attached text 'Servvizio Tecnico Assistenza Clienti' from an Olivetti ad.\n\nMy initial reaction was Universe Condensed, but on closer inspection it's not quite right and the poster is from 1953 and so would be too early for Univers.\n\nCan anyone else help? Is their any chance this would be hand-lettered?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tumblr\\_mprmaua8ga1ri4e6jo1\\_1280.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822002333/http:/typophile.com/files/tumblr_mprmaua8ga1ri4e6jo1_1280.jpg) | 87.96 KB |\n\n",
