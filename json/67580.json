  "content": "Hi there,\n\nLooking for something similar to this retro/vintage script font (used on an 80s portuguese tv show).  \nThe letters aren't even the same so this is probably all handwritten - but I'm desperately looking for something like this.\n\nThe words are cut - it read 'ora' and 'olha' (the complete words would be 'agora escolha').\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen shot 2010-02-19 at 01.15.18.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015100744/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-02-19%20at%2001.15.18.png) | 154.93 KB |\n\n",
