For example, doing a search with  \n`site:typophile.com flash player text engine`  \nonly returns \\*one\\* result -- this one [http://typophile.com/node/29359?page=8](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/typophile.com/node/29359?page=8 \"http://typophile.com/node/29359?page=8\") -- which is actually quite inaccurate. I was obviously expecting more results, and at least this page ( [http://typophile.com/node/45368](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/typophile.com/node/45368 \"http://typophile.com/node/45368\")) on the list.\n\nIs anyone been having a similar experience? Is this a Google glitch or a Typophile issue?\n\n",

Also, the Google Cache links are unreliable at best, and it seems to find outdated forum listings rather than actual threads.  \nSo what's up with Typophile's own search engine – did it work better in the past?\n\n"

Grr!\n\nFor those who didn't know: for quite a while now, Typophile users have been using Google to search for Typophile threads, since it was working better than Typophile's search engine. Grant Hutchinson had even created [a favelet to let us search Typophile using Google](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/www.splorp.com/2005/05/googophiling.html)...\n\n"

I want the real thing, not the feed of it.\n\nJust 2 examples for queries that have delivered a couple of dozens hits before, and now hardly a single useful one. At least one of them actually has a Wiki entry (which can’t be found):\n\n[Unica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20unica) [[my results](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/florian.hardwig.com/public/typophile/google-unica.png)]\n\n[Featured Face](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20featured%20face) [[my results](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/florian.hardwig.com/public/typophile/google-ff.png)]\n\nFurthermore, it seems Typophile has no proper 404 page, at least not for URLs of this scheme: [http://www.typophile.com/node/_nonsense_](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/www.typophile.com/node/nonsense).

      "content": "It is surprising that advertising people do not know nor care that the simpler the html stuff of a website, the more hits will result.\n\nI looked at the html internals of this \"Is anyone else getting poor results...\" thread, and it became clear for me why the Google results are so poor. For instance, this tiny thread alone has 30 picture links, a big css file, several php files, several js files and other stuff. Google's crawler would need too many seconds to evaluate this tiny thread, considering that Google tries to evaluate all websites of the entire world. The consequence is that Google simply skips many websites.\n\nThe simpler the html stuff, the better for the Google crawler. For instance, my website has the simplest html imaginable (no css, no php, no js, etc.). The web design looks drab drab drab, but the hits are huge huge huge.\n\nTaking into consideration that my website deals with the rarest topics imaginable (e.g. the ancient Sanskrit language, which is studied by only very few people worldwide), the download hits for these very specialized files at my website are enormeous. In February, so far, for instance the pdf file cdrfonts.pdf was downloaded 1056 times, the txt file unicode.txt was download 817 times, and the \"Sanskrit 2003\" font sans2003.zip was downloaded 813 times. All this only at the [www.sanskritweb.NET](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/ \"www.sanskritweb.NET\") site (I also run [www.sanskritweb.DE](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/www.sanskritweb.de/ \"www.sanskritweb.DE\") and [www.sanskritweb.ORG](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023233238/http:/www.sanskritweb.org/ \"www.sanskritweb.ORG\") as mirrow sites with separate download statistics).\n\nSo, if you want to have many hits at the Typophile site brought about by Google search, then simplify the html stuff as much as possible so that it is easy for Google to evaluate your site.\n\n"

Because it used to work without any problems whatsoever. But all of a sudden it doesn't anymore. So the problem must lie elsewhere. There might be more than one reason, but the way this site is coded hasn't changed much lately, so I doubt that plays a role.\n\n"
