Note that i´m talking about licenses with no warning about changes in the future. Thanks...\n\n",

      "content": "In my experience (which is relatively limited) and bearing in mind that I am not a lawyer, you are usually bound by the license at the time you acquired it. With this in mind there is a distinct advantage to keeping a record of any purchases along with a copy of the license at the time of purchase. Seeing how the third party IP represented by the Adobe Font Folio has evolved over time it has been interesting (okay, from my point of view :-) to see how the support documentation for licensing has evolved with it.\n\nA similar approach could be taken with open source fonts as licensing and types of license are subject to change. This could be particularly important where a license has changed from, for example, the [Apache License, version 2.0](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105323/http:/www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) to the [SIL Open Font License, version 1.1](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105323/http:/scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL), the former permitting commercial sale of the fonts where the latter does not.\n\n"
