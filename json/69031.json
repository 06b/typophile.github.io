I really think that's not need help to be readable and clearly diferent between it self and /O/ counter.. and so.. and I expect this font will come to make unique specially for this kind details.. haha.. may be some people not like.. may be and surely some peoples could love that detail.. I don't mind yet.. need some opinions else.\n\nThank you for notice me about that details and drop your advices.\n\n"
