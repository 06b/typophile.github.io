Or would starting with a double link on the main stems without touching the sidebearing be preferred?\n\n",

      "content": "Depends somewhat on the usage of the font and what rasterizers you care about. But the big question is, do you need to preserve the spacing at low ppems, or are you willing to have the spacing get looser to maintain legibility?   \n   \nMost folks doing manual hinting are willing and able to distort the spacing at low ppems, which allows for the possibility of either using left-to-right hinting across the glyph, or using intermediate deltas that affect the right sidebearing to open up a glyph that is hinted outside-in.   \n   \nT\n\n"

      "content": "I generally prefer to hint from left to right, as this makes it easier to preserve good lettershape. If you hint from the outside in, you have limited options for controlling the width of internal counters, which might get squished or extended at some sizes. You end up having to helta hint the whole character width at certain sizes, whereas if you hint from one side to the other you can specify a CVT white space value to control the counter as if it were a stem.\n\n"
