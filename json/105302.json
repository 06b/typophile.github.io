  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm creating a sans-serif font but as alternates the I and J have little serifs, and I want to carry over the alternates to the small caps. I'm getting a little stuck on the scripting. (Massive newbie on the scripting btw).\n\nSo when Small Caps are on with alternates the small cap serif I will be displayed instead of tthe small cap I.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
