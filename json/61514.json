Better brush up on your [Français](http://web.archive.org/web/20120709135854/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language).\n\nDespite the fact I'm a bit of a digit head, I have to admit I've always been fascinated by graffiti art, due to the fact that it's largely type-based. There's a fantastic documentary on the history of graffiti called [Bomb It](http://web.archive.org/web/20120709135854/http:/www.bombit-themovie.com/). I highly recommend.\n\n(_clip in top right corner_)\n\n",

That guy, Cui Xianren (above image), has some amazing life in his strokes and character shapes as a whole. Immediately reminded me of Chaz Bojorquez, and then onto Retina, and then back onto some old school black letter 'artists' - who also had such a natural talent for letter (character) shapes.\n\n(I won't bore the stodgy here with a long list of amazing graff writters.)\n\nOld and new graffiti letter shapes coming up off from the streets have a lot more life to them than something puked from a 'puter. Especially the stuff being crapped out fontstruct. Letter shapes on the street express a dynamic gesture - something you can't fake in font lab. It seems to me that the people laying it down on the street are by far more natural in their letter shape talent than most of the well heeled 'puter driven type designers. But the well heeled 'puter driven type designer is by far more - clever.\n\nAnd as for your new found friend Blek Le Rat, I've followed his work for some time now. It's interesting to note in today's auction houses the number of artist who's stuff has come up from the streets is dramatically increasing.\n\n"
