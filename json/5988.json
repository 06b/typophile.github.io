Select the numerator and either a) make it superscript or b) change the font size to 50% size and shift the baseline. If working with a 12pt font, you can change the numerator to 6pt and then give it a 6pt baseline shift. (These functions are easily found in the Text tool palette)   \n  \n3. Select the denominator and change its font size to 50% size   \n  \n4. Finally, check your kerning - you might need to nudge the characters to get it just right.\n\n"
