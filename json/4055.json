  "content": "Hi Typophiles,   \n   \nWhen I started my font in 1994 I didn't know very much about typography. I liked the Meta (not Plus at that time) from Spiekerman and the Scala from Majoor. I was amazed by some glyph forms of both fonts. From that moment I started drawing characters and decided to create my own font. I have completed my font in 1996. (I called it Delicious after Golden Delicious, an apple name, because I've worked on a mac since 1992). Now when the OpenType font format hopefully is taking over the world, I would like to add some extra's to it (ligatures/smallcaps etc.) and maybe make some necessary changes. Any comments are welcome. Excuse me for my bad English writing, spelling and grammar and greetings from the Netherlands.   \n  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012115358im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32409.gif)\n\n",

Guess it is the hugest family I see here...   \n   \nSome little notes: The UC 'O' and 'Q' of the Roamn (guess you mean Roman :-)): The Curves seams not be round, a little bit like a rhombus (hope this is the right word)   \nDownstroke semi serif of the lc 'a': I dont know but In mine eyes goes to far. Should look more like lc 'd' and 'u'   \nThe lc 's' and uc 'S' (in any font): mhh.. looks strange but not absolutle false. Normaly the s is bolder in the bottom. You have mirrowed it. Dont know maybe it will work. Yust experience with it..   \n   \nw,v,x,y of the Italics: The corner at the right top is nice but i guess it is to stong, maybe a smother corner will help.   \n   \nGreetings from your neighbour country germany   \nJens\n\n"

Widths are not done. Go back and check them. I would suggest more unification in line weights/widths. A great concept worth refining.\n\n"
