In fact, there’s a [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093040/http:/deletedthread.blogspot.com/ \"Deleted Thread\") of nothing but deleted MetaFilter [blue] threads.) If necessary, a customized 404 page could be displayed, but that wouldn’t tell enough of the story.\n\nPresently, a deleted page leads you to _some other_ page, usually a calendar of events. In essence, the site lies to you: You wanted one page, but we deleted that one without telling you and have decided to show you something you didn’t want instead. It’s misleading and anti-Web.\n\n",
