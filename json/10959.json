I'm from Sweden, and I'm having some difficulties understanding some words here...   \n   \nI started on a thinner version of the above, but I'm wondering if there's any smart way of doing the rough version automatic, and then clean it up?

Lc \"r\" and \"s\", for example, seem a bit wide, while lc \"k\", \"x\" and perhaps \"f\" seem a bit narrow.   \n   \nOn the whole, the upper case seems a bit narrow compared to the lower case, also. I'm not sure, however, if the upper case should be widened or if the lower case should be narrowed. I suppose it depends on the overall width you're going for.   \n   \nAside from this, I like a lot of the design decisions you made. You've managed to soften and humanize a very rigid geometric genre.   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
