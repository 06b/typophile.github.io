  "content": "Hi Typophille\n\nI am designing a font for Kashmiri in fontcreator and Volt. I encountered a problem with one of my characters uni065F. It is a below mark and is used in combination with other characters. i set its positioning in volt and type as mark but when i test it in microsoft word it creates joining problem for the character with which it is used. it does not let the character with which it is used to join with successive character. Any help would be a great help. thanks\n\n",
