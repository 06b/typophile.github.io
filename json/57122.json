It not only gives you a certain roundness, but also some funny kerning issues, that give it more naive vernacular look. But it looks like a Latin-American sign, not early 20th century European type...\n\n"

I wish it was more like News Gothic and not Futura, but it's definitely a choice.\n\nBeo Sans doesn't quit seem to fit the period (?)\n\nTelephoto is a bit too clean, the effect will wanish in smaller point sizes.\n\nCubanica Marquee is a nice alternative too.\n\nChristian, yes I have thought about similiar methods too, but I need lots of text and that method would be too slow and painful.\n\n"
