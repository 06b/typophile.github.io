I understand your type study, but if a logo doesn’t communicate what a company is about at a first glance then you’ve missed the point. I don’t think it looks like Nike. It reads Nike, but it doesn’t feel like Nike. Hard angles might be the most difficult issue. Nike doesn’t use hard edges.  \nbest regards,  \ndaniel\n\n"

Most of the time it would make them looks stupid in comparison and such assignment is not very constructive. (unless it’s an assignment designed with specific purpose in mind like to challenge the status quo and see how far you can push it...)\n\nIf it’s not broken,why fix it?\n\nThe lecturer is the one to be responsible here. Please tell the students in the first place what’s wrong with the current Nike logo (if you can identify one) and what is there to improve? If not how would you judge whether the newly modified version by the student is an improvement?\n\nDesign is about solving problems. How would the student learn this process if they can’t identify the problems?\n\nweng\n\n"
