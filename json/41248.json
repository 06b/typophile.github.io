  "content": "Sorry for the off-topic post. I think the term has something to do with typography, but I can't be sure as I don't understand it :)\n\nIt appears in this sentence about bad dictionary layout:\n\n_Vores egen erfaring er, at der findes ordbøger af høj kvalitet, som har et så uroligt **læsebillede** og en så lille skrift, at brugen er vanskeliggjort._\n\nwhich comes from this paper: [http://netordbogen.asb.dk/Lit/Hermes/H04\\_02.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019050306/http:/netordbogen.asb.dk/Lit/Hermes/H04_02.pdf \"http://netordbogen.asb.dk/Lit/Hermes/H04\\_02.pdf\")\n\nI can see that it comes from \"read\" and \"picture\" but beyond that I can't make heads or tails of it. If anyone could explain what it means, I'd be much obliged.\n\n",
