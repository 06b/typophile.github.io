It has a vaguely art nouveau look, but also a lot of 70’s counter-culture connections.\n\nHere is a link to an example:  \n [http://4.bp.blogspot.com/\\_kRm2JG596XA/R8XikknGoDI/AAAAAAAAASs/BLYvQvPnWF...](http://web.archive.org/web/20090627135858/http:/4.bp.blogspot.com/_kRm2JG596XA/R8XikknGoDI/AAAAAAAAASs/BLYvQvPnWFA/s400/Sailor+on+the+seas+of+fate+cover+3.JPG \"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/\\_kRm2JG596XA/R8XikknGoDI/AAAAAAAAASs/BLYvQvPnWFA/s400/Sailor+on+the+seas+of+fate+cover+3.JPG\")\n\nCan anyone tell me the font name, and if there is a downloadable freeware or shareware version? Thanks.\n\n- Rich\n\n",
