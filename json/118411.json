If you want the plaintext preserved, I think you're probably stuck with making a second font.\n\nBut if this is only for your own use, or for users who you can expect to follow specific instructions, you could pack your alternates into ligatures. Designate a few easily-accessed characters you won't really need (like `~^) for \"ligature codes\" then make A.ss02 into grave\\_grave\\_A, or such.\n\n"

What to do. ?\n\n"

      "content": "Are any of them best described as intersections of two other features? For instance, is Titling 2 composed of Titling versions of the alternate forms in Stylistic Set 1? If so, it shouldn't be its own feature; it should be handled by those two features when they are both on. You just have to be mindful of the order of execution. Even if that's not strictly how they correspond, it is probably still reasonable to game it that way.\n\n"
