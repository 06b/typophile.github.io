  "content": "I am close to having to decide what face to use for an upcoming book project. The project has one or two unique requirements. It is about 85,000 words, and will also contain about 25% illustrations/photos/designs--i.e. text will be broken up and it will be unusual to have more than 3 pages in a row consisting solely of text. It will be printed on a book printing web offset press (as opposed to standard web) on high-quality book paper.\n\nAbout 35-40% of the text will be printed in a dark-red ink like Pantone 186 or 193 (the rest in black). Because of this I want a font that is low in contrast, and dark, as I am trying to minimize the 'pinking' of the red ink on thinner letterforms.\n\nI am also looking for a tone that is contemporary and cold (or perhaps more appropriately, austere). I also prefer a fully expanded OT font, simply for utility and ease of layout in InDesign. I will be setting at around 10/12.\n\nRight now my current choice is [FF Absara](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013044909/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_absara_ot/), but I have some concerns, and their rather extremely limited specimen PDF is worthless. Has anyone used this to set a large work of text? I am concerned about it being just a bit too busy for such a long work. I am also concerned about readability, though I have read some opinions that say this is not a concern. It also seems to be an extra wide font, but it's hard to tell without being able to actually use it. I'd love to hear from people with experience setting Absara.\n\nI considered [Dolly](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013044909/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=roman), but in the end decided it was too warm for this book, and lacking an OT format. I am still considering [Karmina](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013044909/http:/type-together.com/font_karmina_home.php) from Typetogether as a possibility.\n\nCan anyone please, please recommend some similar faces and/or share the experiences and opinions about these fonts?\n\nThanks so much for your help,\n\nPaul\n\n",

I will actually be flying half-way across the country to do a press-check JUST to make sure that the red looks right before printing 6,000 books. And yes, I agree easily readable type is hugely important, hence my post here and all my questions about Absara.\n\nMHSmith, thanks for the suggestions! Charter has a little too much contrast for this job but Oranda certainly looks like a good possibility. SAdly they don't have an OT version, so thats a strike against it.\n\nthanks! pfm\n\n"

In the Adobe OpenType collection, take a look at Chaparral, Dante, Electra, and Giovanni. And though it offers higher contrast, Warnock is a really distinguished new option for all of us.\n\n"
