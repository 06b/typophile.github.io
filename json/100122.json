This looks like a custom job based on some machanical/squared condensed sans (some finials and angles cut and /A crossbar reworked).  \nSome fonts to base the customization on: [Banque (not Bank) Gothic Extra Condensed Extra Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018073717/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/banque-gothique-rr/), [Diamante](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018073717/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/diamante/), [Octin College](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018073717/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/octin-college/)  \nAlternative for the laziest: [Anitlles](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018073717/http:/www.dafont.com/anitlles.font) (possibly an attempt to digitize a font based on the original main title)\n\n"
