  "content": "Hi! I'm in search of the typeface used for signage all over Venezia, as the one showed in the picture. In the last Biennale di Architettura, designer John Morgan used it as inspiration for the biennale posters and branding typeface. It sure is much like Didot, but then is worked as stencil, like Charrette (which is mainly associated with Le Corbusier) and which is heavier and thicker than the one used in Venezia... I've done a basic search and found no information on the matter. Could you please help me out?  \nThank you all!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [8124613465\\_afed148d22.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326031611/http:/typophile.com/files/8124613465_afed148d22.jpg) | 124.95 KB |\n| [8124634236\\_0317437a20.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326031611/http:/typophile.com/files/8124634236_0317437a20.jpg) | 138.15 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Last year I visited Venice and also noticed the stencil signage (of course). I got the impression that there were several styles of templates that changed over the years. Also I have seen these kind of stencil street name signs i other places in northern Italy, so I think that there are many different styles of this lettering. Chopping up Bodoni-like typefaces for stencil-usage may be typical for northern Italy as from the second half of the 18th century, but the way the idea is executed may vary by signpainter and by stencil-supplier, so I don’t think that there is one style of stencil lettering that is typical to Venice …\n\n"
