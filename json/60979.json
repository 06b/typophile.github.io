  "content": "Hi all.  \nI'm new here so please sorry if this question isn't related to this wonderful forum.\n\nI'm looking for a **reasonably** priced sans serif font (something like Frutiger or Myriad). I tried quoting for Segoe UI (_yes, I know that it's a reap off from Frutiger_) Ascendercorp who is responsible for providing licenses for it and they gave me price quote at $1500 per year for letting me distribute their font in my application. It's a bit too much for me - I'm trying to create a stylish application for personal home use and I'm doing only first steps to make it. I even didn't start selling it yet.\n\nSo enough with my boring explanation. Does anybody know good Sans Serif font with license to distribute it in the commercial application with a price below $1000?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

So users will be able to view and edit texts displayed using that font. I'm not going to subset the font. Users will not be able to use the font outside the application.\n\n_Bert,_  \nThanks, I will try contact him - Museo is looking very good.\n\n_Jens,_  \nPart of your questions I answered in reply to Ivo. The font will not be installed in users Fonts directory. I will also embed it so to prevent users from installing it or using it them selfs :)\n\n"
