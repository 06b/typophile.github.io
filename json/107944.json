It is a very close match for [Alternate Gothic No. 3](http://web.archive.org/web/20140825204127/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt/) in terms of character shapes, widths etc. — though Alternate Gothic is quite heavy and doesn't have the straight tail on the /Q/.\n\nQantas have rebranded recently.
