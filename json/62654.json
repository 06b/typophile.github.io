  "content": "Fragaria ×ananassa = strawberry\n\nCitrus ×sinensis = orange\n\nI'm putting together a few fancy pictures of fruits and veggies and have placed the Latin names as labels to the macroshots of the food. My copywriter provided me with the correct words, however there is a strange \"×\" symbol that I have never encountered before. What does it stand for? I'm treating the kerning as if it where a regular \"x\" character but is it suppose to be ascended or descended?\n\n",

Spacing and kerning probably should be handled as it would be as a math symbol.\n\nI reason this only by parsing your question and not any extensive knowledge of the relevant subject.\n\n"

      "content": "The × does indeed signify hybrid (cross-breeding). I believe that horticultural style guides vary on whether there should be space following the × or not. I think the current tendency is closed up, whereas previously it was open.\n\nIn many typefaces, the design of the × has it raised above the baseline slightly, depending upon the default figure style. If this is the case and you're using a closed-up style (with no space after), then I suggest you try baseline shifting it down to the baseline (or center on the x-height is also an option).\n\n"
