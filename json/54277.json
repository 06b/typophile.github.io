The final invites will be screen printed on cloth and ripped out for a rough edge. I've been looking at it too long and need some help. Any feedback is great. thanks for your time.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Invite\\_rough.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725155433/http:/typophile.com/files/Invite_rough.png) | 63.19 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "A nice solution to the boring wedding invitation\n\nEither \"with our families\" or \"to share their joy and support their love as they exchange\"\n\nI think \"CHASE\" needs more space, perhaps in letterspacing or leading, or a different font. I may be wanting something more flowing, like the rest of the large text.\n\nThe majority has the aesthetic you're looking for, but the bottom has a more crisp, neutral, modernist, bland, clean feel. I suggest you change that to match the rest.\n\nEven if you don't change the type on the bottom, you may consider removing the line and/or centering the bottom space instead of the whole line or adjusting the letterspacing to center it. I think it needs to be centered somehow if it's going to be separated like that.\n\n"

And I'll work on some more variations in \"CHASE\". I've got to work on it some more tonight and I'll post up a new version. Thanks again.\n\n"
