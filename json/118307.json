  "content": "I always disliked the Georgia font because of its old-style numerals. Not any more. I just discovered the advanced font ligatures in Office. Office 2010 and 2013 now includes advanced typographical features. The OpenType features gives you the option to change number spacing to 'tabular' and the number forms to 'lining'. See this link for instructions: [http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/13484/use-advanced-font-ligatures-in-offi...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140951/http:/www.howtogeek.com/howto/13484/use-advanced-font-ligatures-in-office-2010/ \"http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/13484/use-advanced-font-ligatures-in-office-2010/\")\n\nNow I can use Georgia without being annoyed with the old-style numerals (see attachment). Thank you Microsoft!\n\nWho else likes these new Microsoft Office OpenType features?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [lining vs old-style.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140951/http:/typophile.com/files/lining%20vs%20old-style.PNG) | 7.49 KB |\n\n",
