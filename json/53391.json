  "content": "It's awards season in Hollywood, which means that little golden statues will soon be bestowed upon many of our favorite (or least favorite) motion pictures. We all know that Trajan is Hollywood's font-of-choice when it comes to movie titles and posters, so it's only fitting that we spotlight Trajan in Battle 34.\n\n// THE CHALLENGE\n\nCreate at least three swash characters for Trajan. You can either:\n\nA) Set the word \"BLOCKBUSTER\" or any other movie-related word.\n\nor\n\nB) Design a movie poster using your swash characters in the movie title.\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May the best designer win.\n\n// REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Image size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi\\*  \n- Color: Black and White only (colors are okay only for movie posters)  \n- Format: JPG or PNG\n\n**\\*Please try to keep your file sizes to a minimum! 50k per file max.**\n\n// ABOUT TYPOPHILE [TYPE BATTLES](http://web.archive.org/web/20150203073424/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles)\n\nThis is your chance to stretch your type muscles on a weekly basis. You have one week to create and submit your entry. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nAs with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize — only the ability to call yourself the best on the block.\n\nLink directly to this battle: **[http://www.typophile.com/battle34](http://web.archive.org/web/20150203073424/http:/www.typophile.com/battle34)**  \nLink to the battle directory: [http://www.typophile.com/typebattles](http://web.archive.org/web/20150203073424/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles \"http://www.typophile.com/typebattles\")\n\n",

Muuhahahahaa :P\n\nSeriously - try to draw your own.\n\n"
