Elegant with flourish, vintage, etc. The design work would be for invitations and a logo.\n\nI am having trouble finding examples of this type of work and designers that design this way. Can anyone help me to understand that design/typography style this is considered? Also, what are some good resources online for finding examples of this style and designers who can do this.\n\nThanks.\n\nJoshua\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/image_5133.jpg)\n\n",

Just know that type of design can be incredibly time consuming and not cheap.\n\n"
