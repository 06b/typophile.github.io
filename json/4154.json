  "content": "Okay this is my first post in the critique section so I'm not too sure   \nhow people work with attachments, I'm guessing a PDF will be fine.   \n   \nThis is a project I'm doing in school in a typographic experimentation   \nclass. The typography itself is not really experimental but it's more   \nconceptual. The text speaks about the page (or sheet), at first in a   \nvery mathematical way and in the end it becomes an excuse for   \nimaginary travel.   \n   \nI'm not sure how to say this in english but it's contained in itself,   \nat first the author writes :   \n   \nI'm writing...   \nI'm writing : I'm writing...   \nI'm writing : \"I'm writing...\"   \nI'm writing that I'm writing...   \n   \nFor this reason, I gave a shot at Courier because it really conveys   \nthat typewriter feel and also because I wanted to work the typography   \nin depth (I've already tweaked quite a bit of stuff in there).   \n   \nI'd like to have your opinions, suggestions on the spacing. (And more   \nif you want / can read the text!)   \n   \nBy the way, some paragraphs are upside down because this is meant to   \nbe folded. If anyone feels like giving it a shot, here are the   \nsimplified translated instructions --   \n   \n1 : Fold   \n2 : Flip   \n3 : Fold corner /   \n4 : Fold right corner too   \n5 : Fold one part   \n6 : Flip   \n7 : Fold one part   \n8 : Open and flatten   \n9 : Fold one part   \n10 : Fold one part   \n11 : Open and flatten   \n12 : Pull here.   \n   \nEmilie\n\n<!--attachment: pageA4_erv-32795.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*172.9*La+page*pageA4_erv%2epdf --><!--attachment: pageA4_erv-32795.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*172.9*La+page*pageA4_erv%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140054im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">La page<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140054/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/pageA4_erv-32795.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>pageA4_erv.pdf</b></a> (172.9 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n",
