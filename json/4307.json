It's a monoline sans serif with a bit of modular modernism that I can see being used in magazines or other publications.   \n   \nDon't mind the weird curves on the 3, I'm not sure why illustrator is messing up the curves, but it looks fine in FOG.   \n   \nAny criticisms are welcomed.\n\n<!--attachment: variable_showing-33580.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*45.3*Variable*variable_showing%2epdf --><!--attachment: variable_showing-33580.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*45.3*Variable*variable_showing%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131012115320im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">Variable<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131012115320/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/variable_showing-33580.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>variable_showing.pdf</b></a> (45.3 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n",
