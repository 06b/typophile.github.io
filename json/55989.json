  "content": "Howdy everyone!  \nAs my Google-Fu did not turn up too much useful info in the subject, I was wondering whether somebody might recommend a good specimen book for american poster typography covering the era from around 1840-1900.\n\nI am especially interested in the kinds of ornaments that have been used. So far however, I have mostly seen remakes of the style and am now wondering what really rolled of the presses back then.\n\nAny input much appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [p011007133721.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150319050918/http:/typophile.com/files/p011007133721.jpg) | 194.7 KB |\n\n",

While my budget on this does not allow me to purchase the collections, the gallery images still make a great guide.\n\nChris: have checked out the museum site. While it has very little information in itself, I have sent some mail to the proprietors and hope they might be able to guide me on. The search term \"wood type\" however has turned out to be pure gold. Much thanks!\n\n"

They have scans of a whole bunch of original type catalogs (the resolution is low, but tolerable) and manuals and stuff. I'm sure you could find original wood type sources there.\n\nFor example, you might try \" [Specimen book and catalog; a price list of printers' supplies, showing types and rules in which are embodied all the latest ideas that enable the printer to produce superior work](http://web.archive.org/web/20150319050918/http:/www.archive.org/details/specimenbookcata00inlauoft)\" from the Inland type foundry, St. Louis, 1897.\n\nI haven't downloaded that one, but I did download an 1895 [Cleveland Type Foundry book of specimens](http://web.archive.org/web/20150319050918/http:/www.archive.org/details/cataloguebookofs00clevrich) which has a wood type section with some ornaments including those I've uploaded.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150319050918im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Cleveland_4087.png)\n\n"
