  "content": "wow first post, happy to meet you all,\n\nI am designing a cover for a convict themed book and I want to suggest, using a handrawn typeface, typefaces of the 1850s, especially those specifc to Australia. My question is, does anybody know of some good online type librararies or examples which would help me get a feel for it. Apologies if this is an oft-asked question,\n\nNick\n\n",
