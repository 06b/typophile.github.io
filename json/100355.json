What are the shapes that aren't matching for you? S? a? It does seem like the tails on 'a' and 't' are angled rather than flat, but it's hard to tell with the ink spread.\n\n"

To me, all differences and minor details are due to scanning process and original printing. That's also why I can't be 100% positive but still believe it is Helvetica.  \nRegarding PDF properties, can't explain why but don't think they should be taken in consideration. This is probably due to the OCR process used for scanning this document. When opening document under Ai, there's no text, only the scanned image.\n\n"

Congratulations to Jan on being first runner up. If he makes it to ATypI in Amsterdam I will gladly buy him a drink.\n\nI will be doing more thorough testing starting tonight, but so far it really does look like Swiss 721 Medium. At least, I have enough evidence to arrest and charge the suspect while I look for more, and I have paid Florian his reward. (Hmm, if I continue that analogy, I guess I should have waited for a conviction first.)\n\nI would love to talk more about the analysis and such, but as this is an active case and is expected to go to trial, I should wait until afterwards. Sorry!\n\nIn this particular case, the font ID is only part of the puzzle, but it was the one that was giving me the most trouble. Given that I have two cases going right now, and they both have immediately looming deadlines, I couldn't afford to noodle on it further on my own. I am thrilled by the response! Thank you to everyone who contributed, not only Florian and Jan!\n\n"
