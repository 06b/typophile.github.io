  "content": "For a while now I haven’t followed the Type-ID section at all. One reason is that helps me spend less time on Typophile, but another is that I feel inadequate in the company of the planet’s best font hounds! But I have noticed (through the [old] search facility) that some ID threads evolve into quite interesting discussions, ones I’d love to be exposed to. And I suspect a few others are in my position, so I have a suggestion:\n\nCould we have a Best of Type-ID compilation? It would include threads with juicy discussion but also exceptional cases of font sleuthing, and maybe great humor, etc. Assuming Yves is willing to spend **any** time on something like this, what would reduce his load a lot would be if people (especially the pack of alpha hounds\\*) nominated memorable threads, or even divvied up chronological chunks\\*\\* of all the ID threads and went through them. It could be a long-term thing, as people have the time.\n\n\\* In fact one of the alphas could be the project kahuna instead of Yves.\n\n\\*\\* You could give me a chunk too.\n\nhhp\n\n [‹ Accented characters in headlines](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704152548/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12981 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [A Tale of Two Sisters ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704152548/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12921 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

So maybe try searching on “stephen” + “hhp” from around 2.5 years ago. Or maybe it was “Step-Hen”, since I love hyphens to much.\n\nMissing stuff: my guess is the system processed mine, then it needed a vacation. Seriously, I’ve noticed that posts from anonymous users for one seem to be missing; but that doesn’t explain Stephen’s missing stuff. Maybe it has to do with having multiple login accounts? I’ve always had this one, but I remember early on (like maybe 3.5 years ago) there was some sort of purge and most people created new accounts (thereby exagerating my [relative] post-count even more...) and maybe the system only revives posts of **currently** registered users?\n\nhhp\n\n"
