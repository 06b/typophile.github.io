The same   \ngoes for the bottom bowl of the g which is BTW   \ntoo dark.   \ni's dot should be higher.   \ns needs a lot of work.   \n   \n_Is it worth continuing?_   \n   \nEven though there are similar faces, if you manage   \nto instill some character and personality, why not?   \nFor example: see the use Irma Boon has made of   \nFrank Blokland's Documenta Sans - a face similar to   \nthis and not overused - in her Treumann book. The   \nfact that it's not Gill Sans or the other staples gives   \nit a special freshness. God's in the details.\n\n"
