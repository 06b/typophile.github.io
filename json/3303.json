Can we see more of those? The spiked ones might work for a zoo exhibit or a World's Longest Fingernail Competition. Have you tried a setting?   \n   \nbj   \n   \nAlso, a quick way to align these...use the nudge arrows. You can set the values using control-k, then nudge them to a guide or a snap-to grid. Quick and painless. If you use the open arrow or open lasso tools to select specific points, the nudge will also help you move your points around to experiement or to precisely align.\n\n"
