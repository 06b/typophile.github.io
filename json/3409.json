  "content": "I designed this simple logo for a non profit organisation.   \nThey wanted something informal, cheap to produce and 3D looking.   \nThe palm tree is their symbol and they operate in an area littered   \nwith art deco buildings.   \nThe logo had to be scalable, keeping the same feel from a small   \nblotch of fax ink to a wall size banner.   \n   \nI gave up on anything with gradients generated with 3D studio or   \nthe likes and ended up doing the highlighs on the oily shapes manually.   \nI used dark green since it's a palm tree. It's already abstract   \nenough as it is. Just black and green to keep printing costs down.   \n   \nThe typeface is Willow from Tony Forster. It's from 1990 but it's   \ninspired from turn of the century arts and craft in Austria.   \nNot really art deco but everyone except folks here think it is.   \nI came across this font by mistake ramdomly browsing on MyFonts.   \nIt was also cheap ($21) although it seems to have doubled in price   \nthis past week.   \nI think it works in this context and the customer loved it but what   \ndo I know? I'm really a novice here with most of my knowledge   \nacquired this past year online and browsing books at Borders.   \nI don't want to send something to the printer which will look   \nclich\n\n",

It's like an oil or water drop that is shown growing into a palm tree or person, but not a paw print. They are more interested in something esthetic and unique rather than something with obvious meaning.   \nI think I'll play around with uneven palms for my next attempt. I can't narrow the trunk otherwise it will look like a pot plant.   \n   \nI did play around with quite a few classic art deco era typefaces but their clean geometric shapes don't work well with an amorphous logo IMHO.   \nThe organic feel of turn of the century arts & craft or Art Nouveau (I never figured out the difference) seems to work better with oil slicks.   \nI really like Willow here. It's borderline too whimsical but the organisation helps the homeless and low income residents so it was important to make it friendly and non corporate looking. I'm almost ready to throw away the logo just to keep the typeface.   \n   \nScott: Could you please expand on why Willow doesn't go with a 3D shape? Surely you don't mean adding bevel or shadows. What are fonts that would fit the bill 3D wise?   \n   \nHrant: Willow has only one weight. I wouldn't make it heavier anyway since the lettering would then stand out too much with respect to the logo.   \nI had to darken the colour of the green for that same reason (using gray for the typeface wasn't an option to keep costs down).   \nWhat type would you recommend instead of Trade Gothic? Associating typefaces is one area where I need more experience. I'm at the very beginning of developing a feel for it. My background is in technology, not visual design.   \n   \nThanks all for you time.   \nNew logo to follow in a few hours, that is if I can work through the F1 Grand Prix ruckus.\n\n"

Here's what MyFont says about that typeface.    \n_\"This fanciful, imaginative typeface is of the Viennese Secessionist style. The work of Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh inspired this condensed sans serif style with its rough edges and selection of alternative and ligatured letters. Due to renewed interest in the arts and crafts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Willow will enjoy widespread promotional application. Designed by Tony Forster, one of Europe_\n\n"

To be honest, I think the combination of stained glass, with a slight variation of the old logo, and your new type might be a pretty worthwhile direction to explore. What I mean is\n\n"
