  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am looking for recommendations for a good script or calligraphy or handwriting font.\n\nA type that is interesting and personal yet legible and clear. Nothing too formal or ornate like something that would be used for a wedding invitation. The primary use will be for my name at the top of my resume and on my website. (I don't want it to look like it is actually my signature but hope that it projects some individuality.) The other font that I am using on the resume is Gill Sans and the other font that I am using on the website is LTC Twentieth Century Medium.\n\nAny suggestions would be very much appreciated!!! Thanks:)\n\n",
