  "content": "Hello, I am searching out ideas for a print project. I am looking for a text font to use with the (House) font [Castaway](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017203254/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=27&subpage=viewfontspecimens) (which I am using for headers). This is a fun eatery guide. Target is vegetarians. Needs to complement whimsical illustrations and be easily read at 10 or 11 pts. Something on the lines of [Cafeteria](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017203254/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/cafeteria/), but not Cafeteria as it is too condensed. Something playful, but no crazy hand lettering. Suggestions greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n [‹ Id this type in Luottokuntas logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017203254/http:/typophile.com/node/38129 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Church identity and font licensing ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017203254/http:/typophile.com/node/38071 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
