      "content": "Are the contours supposed to be \"choppy\"? That's pretty cool.   \n   \nOverall, I like the funky wrapping you've put on the decidedly classical structure. The \"a\" is very nice, but the \"e\" is bothering me - maybe give a flare to the bar (or a small serif). I like the sharp serifs too - they convey a nice dignity, like in Meridien. One thing that's strange though is that the ascenders look shorter than the descenders. Coupled with the fact that the caps are to me a bit large wrt the ascenders (not to mention that making ascenders taller is one of the easier mods, at least in Latin), maybe make the ascenders longer?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
