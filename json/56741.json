  "content": "I'm looking for examples of stencil type that is less masculine and more neutral or even feminine in appearance.\n\nAny ideas? I thinking more about how the counters are bridged than the actual font itself.  \nThis is for reference so if you are not quite sure it fits the bill, post anyway and I will no doubt get something out of it.\n\nI know this is based on a preconception of what is masculine etc but nevermind, that's the field on which we play!\n\nThanks\n\n",
