  "content": "hello\n\ni’m not happy with photoshop’s text smoothing. when a font (non-pixel-font) is like 10 px there are always ugly smoothing edges.\n\nhow do i achieve these very fine text smoothing like in [http://www.filemaker.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20071205084112/http:/www.filemaker.com/ \"http://www.filemaker.com/\") (manage people etc. top left). in photoshop this just looks ugly.\n\nwhat is the way to make very fine and accurate smoothing when text size is only like 10 px? thanks.\n\n [‹ Helvetica and \"new media designers\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20071205084112/http:/www.typophile.com/node/507 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Georgia on the Mac ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071205084112/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14922 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This level of quality cannot be -or at least has not yet been- automated. Also, you can’t “convert” from some other format to an ultrafont - at least not without spending gobs of time cleaning up - time better spent making one from scratch (like my stuff is).\n\nhhp\n\n"
