When I last used it (In November) shirt designs still had to be uploaded as RGB raster files; you know what that does to the output. Also, the CafePress t-shirts are apparently sized for a universe in which all Americans are direct descendants of Divine; my medium fitted shirts could easily be used as nightgowns by most adult Americans.\n\n"

When I called (repeatedly) to straighten it out, they were VERY unhelpful.\n\nI’ve spoken to at least five people at CafePress, including three managers, and they all \\*see\\* the problem, but nobody can fix it. Two managers told me they’d fix it and call me back, and neither did. I finally just gave up. I roll my eyes every month when they email me telling me I’ve earned “negative dollars” this pay period, even though I’ve taken all my designs down.\n\nI don’t recommend them, obviously.\n\n"
