  "content": "Hey folks,\n\nThis is probably not even possible, but I'm trying as a last resort. A client doesn't have a vector of their logo and I'm trying to match up the TM in their logo. I've managed to figure out/match up all other fonts but this. I know this isn't much to go on, but I cannot seem to find anything that's close to this. Any ideas at all, besides 'just use whatever' :)\n\nThanks so much!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TM.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419130349/http:/typophile.com/files/TM_0.jpg) | 2.35 KB |\n\n",

Next time, you should rather ask [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419130349/http:/typophile.com/typeid), on the new board.\n\n"
