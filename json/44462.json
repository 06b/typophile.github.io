The folks at DataPortability.org were trying to vet their logo candidates in order to avoid a potential case of trademark infringement.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s precisely what happened. The logo that was selected (#3, 1st row) looks a bit too much like the Zaoza logo. It’s really too bad: [http://zaoza.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012142114/http:/zaoza.com/ \"http://zaoza.com/\")\n\nThey are probably going to look at a secondary candidates from this list, so if anyone has any other specific ideas about possible trademark infringements, any help would be great.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
