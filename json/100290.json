In the Fall of 2012, printing historian Rich Hopkins contacted P22 type foundry regarding a collection of [inked type drawings](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713071627/http:/blog.p22.com/) he had just uncovered from his acquisition of the Baltimore base \"Baltotype\" company some 20 years ago. The Athena drawings included a full upper and lower case set, numerals, basic punctuation and alternate forms of some letters.\n\nThe design is a narrow deco flavored design from the 1950s and bares resemblance to the all caps Lanston typeface, LTC Spire. Athena was designed by George Battee specifically for Baltotype and features a curious avoidance of straight lines in the stems and main strokes. The face has now been expanded to over 340 characters by Miranda Roth and includes ligatures and a full Pan-European character set. LTC Athena is released through the Lanston division of P22 in consideration of it's earlier incarnation as a metal typeface.\n\nMore details, here:  \n [LTC Athena](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713071627/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/athena.html)  \n [P22 Blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713071627/http:/blog.p22.com/)\n\n",
