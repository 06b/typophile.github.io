This is the first vintage remake (and full typeface for that matter) that I've undertaken and I know it could use some tweeking, but would love feedback at this early stage, both overall and also any specifics.\n\nHere's a link to the original poster: [http://www.idave.com/INVASIONSAUCER.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416053904/http:/www.idave.com/INVASIONSAUCER.jpg \"http://www.idave.com/INVASIONSAUCER.jpg\")\n\nThanks for your comments!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [invasion\\_sans.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416053904/http:/typophile.com/files/invasion_sans.pdf) | 242.18 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Start by making similar characters consistent (not identical, just consistent). Look at the counters (negative spaces): **G** has a much wider counter than **C** , and **B** has much wider counters than **D**. The counters in **Y** , **A** , **U** , and **V** are all different widths. The bottom counters on **K** , **R** , and **X** all have rounded tops, but the bottom counter on **A** is flat on top. **H** looks like it's from a different alphabet because the vertical strokes are so thin and the counters are so wide.  \nLowercase **m** and **n** are rounded, but lowercase **h** isn't. The descender on **g** is completely different from that on **y**.  \nAssemble these characters into some words and phrases. If you make the word **CHOOSE** , you'll see the problem with **H** right away, and when you compare **C** and **O** , you'll get a start on making your stroke weights consistent.\n\n"
