      "content": "I can only justify one magazine subscription: The New Yorker. I used to subscribe to Metropolis but I became irritated with it over time. It's primarily an architectural magazine and has nice, enormous pages - but it doesn't use all that paper real estate for big photographs. Instead it's all designery in that it uses white space profusely - and while I normally advocate more white space than less, in this case it's just plain wrong. Rather than fill the pages with big pictures where you can see the detail there are far too many instances where the pictures accompanying articles are no bigger than thay would have been if the magazine was normal tabloid size. It really seems a terrible waste of that large format to me.\n\n"
