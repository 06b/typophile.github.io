  "content": "Hello, I'm looking for a font with slightly rounded corners. I need regular, bold and heavy versions. I want it to look a bit like the attached font - which was designed for UKTV and therefor not for sale. It has a modern feel but is very structured and regular in design. I like the fact it does not feel condensed.\n\nCan anyone help? Thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [home.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140801214822/http:/typophile.com/files/home_0.jpg) | 66.82 KB |\n\n",
