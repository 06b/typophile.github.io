  "content": "Welcome everybody,\n\nI have been wondering for a while what is the Latin name for the pilcrow... I am looking for a good name for my book design company that I am about to establish; I’ve had lots of ideas, unfortunately, as it is common with ideas - many people have them, and the choice is not so satisfactory.\n\nEh, anyway, could anyone help me with this? I am getting a bit desperate.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nprzemek debowski\n\n [‹ Did we miss Dan Weaver and Eric West's Birthday?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071121095431/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16460 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The Romantic period (18th & 19th C) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071121095431/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16140 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
