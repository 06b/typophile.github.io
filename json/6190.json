I can see certain magazines and such wanting to use it.   \n   \nI think the UC \"C\" needs more flourish, the 1st UC \"G\" doesn't work, and the simpler UC \"I\" is better, except its symmetry is ungainly: try just moving one of the small horizontal joins down.   \n   \nThe lc : I think it should stay without flourishes, and you might check out the work of Gudrun von Hesse for possible guidance: [http://www.myfonts.com/person/zapf-von-hesse/gudrun/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213231/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/zapf-von-hesse/gudrun/)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The undecorated letters remind me of Diotima, Koch Antiqua, and Nicholas Cochin.   \n   \nThe letters are very thin, though. Have you started bumping up against the limitations of em-square granularity? Speaking of which, also be careful of sharp, acute angles in your contours. They're usually not a problem, but can sometimes cause strange rendering artifacts on certain output devices.   \n   \nSome of the decorated caps can be confusing,   \nsince the stem widths are so close to the hairline strokes. I'll have to look at it some more before I can offer more useful advice. But you should definitely continue with it... you've got something there.\n\n"
