I've seen my work used (and misused) in a few magazine ads, alternative newpaper covers,   \nand even for on-screen text regularly on a television show.   \n   \nOn the other hand, I've never been paid for what I've done. If I want to turn my interest into more \"job\"   \nand less \"hobby\", what do I do? All I have is my body of work, nothing in my higher education that   \ncould be spun to make it look like I've studied type in any real way.   \n   \nWhat are your suggestions? How did you all do it?\n\n",

You probably will be happy to pick up any kind of type design work you can, but it pays to market yourself as a specialist: someone who can offer specific services to a particular niche market. If you get a couple of jobs in that area, and do them well, your name will get around. A number of type designers have successfully identified themselves with particular markets, e.g. Jonathan Hoefler with custom types for magazine art directors. Apart from helping to get you remembered, this approach also gets you more of the kind of work you want to be doing, presuming you pick a speciality that you enjoy.\n\n"

The only time I myself have managed to make enough money doing that was when: I had a virtual strangle-hold on the Armenian market; and I was a bachelor living in a small -if comfy- apartment. :-/   \n   \nI think the best way to address the retail market is the way many big names do it: design a font under commission, give the client exclusivity for 2-3 years (after which the novelty value is gone), and after that put it out for general sale. And price high.   \n   \nMarketing: use online forums, conferences, and \"networking\". Try to get people to use pre-release versions of your fonts in real projects (maybe give them a break - but make sure they're not the type to \"share\" the fonts too much), and use those to show them off. There's nothing as effective as a physical newspaper or a high-gloss piece in your hand with your font(s) on it.   \n   \nBut the fonts have to be good. Hone your craft.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Quality Work.**   \nWithout this, all the advice in the world will not amount to   \nmaking type design a significant part of your income. You   \nmention no formal type education. This won't matter much if   \nyour work is excellent. If it's not, consider some good   \ninstruction. Buy it if you can/have to. You're in Vancouver!   \nGreat city to be in. Three very kind Vancouverite typophiles   \nprowl these forums (perhaps more): Keith Tam, John Hudson   \n(whom you've just heard from), and Jim Rimmer. They may give   \nyou specific ideas about resources nearby where you can really   \nbegin to hone your craft and take your work to the next level.   \nWhile there is not substitute for hands on instruction, post   \nwork here for critique. Get help wherever you can.   \nWhich brings me to...   \n   \n**2. Confidence/Boldness**   \nThis is so useful to improve the quality of your work, and also to   \nmoving your work once it is quality. Attack! Nicely. One bit of   \ntrouble with the term \\*quality work\\* is you never know when you've   \narrived. I'm content to think if only I had this polished up, then I   \ncould... No. Show people what you have. Ask for their help.   \nEspecially go to people in the old guard. They are usually so   \nexcited to see a new generation of designers they will often   \nbend over backwards to help you. Type designers are a spry lot...   \n   \nI was shocked at typecon when less than 8 people wanted to   \nhave Akira Kobayashi, Matthew Carter, and John Downer give   \nthem pointers. So what if it's was a public forum? That's what   \nyou're pushing for in the end isn't it? Gopherit!   \n   \nI've heard some say, don't ask for too much advice or you will   \nloose your own voice for everyone elses. I hear that argument,   \nbut think it applies mostly to people who already know their way   \naround letters. At first, get as much input as you can from people   \nyou can trust (such as those mentioned).   \n  \nFinally, let me say I only have one font commercially available,   \nsoon to be two. Needless to say, type design makes up a small   \npart of my income (and take my advice with a grain of salt!). I'm   \na graphic designer with one toe in the font world. Hopefully it   \nwill soon be one foot in fonts. Then maybe graphic design can   \nbe the small part of my income. All that to say, don't quit your   \nday job just yet :-)   \n   \nKeep loving letters!   \nRandy   \n   \nPS. Good grief, what a rag.\n\n"

For example, some famous type designers can make great practical fonts that sell very well, but the space between their ears is a theory-free zone, shall we say. So if you're making something innovative you have to ignore big chunks of their advice, and focus on their technical feedback.   \n   \nBTW, concerning the lack of participation at TypeCon, I myself can't blame the \"students\". Seeing the droves of people wanting to get their fonts critiqued on Typophile, where there's not even anybody of the caliber of Carter or Kobayashi, makes me think the problem was something else.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

He seemed quite happy to do it both times, but I don't want to wear out my welcome.   \n   \nThis weariness is because I've previously had a really, really bad experience with another famous type designer here in Germany, but I'm not going to go into that on a public forum(thankfully, he is much further than 100m away).   \n   \nWhile I was at Typo Berlin (which, as I've heard, has a very different atmosphere from TypeCon), I showed my work to everybody. I mean EVERYBODY. I printed up 300 shiny new business cards and everything. Some designers where very receptive when I showed them things, and they made my day (or, in the case of H&FJ, they made my whole _conference_ ). Some other designers were quite clear that they did not want to look at things. Again, naming names here would be impolite. Sometimes, you need to realize though that at a large event--Typo Berlin had 1000 attendants and hundreds of students--certain people (especially the German speakers) field requests constantly. For example, at one point I waited in line for a half an hour to speak with Erik Spiekermann. And as each new student got up to him, asking him (sometimes downright harrasing) questions, I could see his engery level getting lower and lower. By the time I got to him, he just seemed tired. He asked me to email him instead, and I did.   \n   \n**Be bold!** But be careful, too.\n\n"
