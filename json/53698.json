Is there any list of trustable sites that sell fonts and support their clients?\n\nthank you  \nMila\n\n",

Feel free to contact me at [coles@fontshop.com](mailto:coles@fontshop.com) and I'll see what I can do. Short of that, our expert tech folks will get back to you first thing tomorrow morning.\n\n"
