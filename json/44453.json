As always, please respect the [EULA](http://web.archive.org/wiki/EULA) when using free fonts:  \n“Some are licensed for unlimited use, some only for private use but not for commercial jobs. You don’t want to take advantage of the kindness and generosity of the people who designed them; it’s really bad for your karma. And you don’t want to risk that, do you?” — [Yves Peters](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Yves%20Peters)\n\n**Why doesn't this page list freeware font websites?**  \nMost of the sites below are run by type designers or foundries, and they tend to offer a few dozen fonts at most. Why doesn't this page list the huge freeware websites? Take a quick look at those sites and you'll see that the fonts there are of variable quality, with not many that are good for professional design work. But even more important, many of the type designs are clearly copied from other people's work. To be fair, mixed in with the knockoffs are thousands of original fonts made by amateurs who just love type. But the lack of oversight—anyone can upload—and the confusing way that those sites mix the bad with the good, makes it hard for us to recommend them. (In the end, those sites need no help; a Google search quickly turns them up.) Below, legitimate free fonts offered by the people who created them.\n\n**Individual Fonts**  \n [Birra Stout](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301011556/http:/www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/birra_stout) from Darden Studio  \n [Aller Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301011556/http:/typophile.com/node/51198) from DaMa  \n [Lido](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301011556/http:/www.stormtype.com/free.html) by [Storm Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Storm%20Type%20Foundry).
