I get the expected .otf file that works without a hitch.\n\nHere is the directory structure of the file I'm creating:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421234917im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pic-2_5286.gif)\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",

It works for the Minion sample, but not mine. I created all of the documents using the Myriad files as templates, so I don't know if they are the problem.\n\nI'm reading Miguel Sousa's \"Font production at Adobe\" .pdf for some clues. I re-exported the .pfa using standard encoding, and that's getting me further along the line.\n\nNow I'm having an issue with the glyph names db. Will it never end? What's the best way to create or output that db from Fontlab 5 on a Mac?\n\n"

      "content": "I'm going to guess that you're not giving makeOTF info on what font outline file (OTF, PS, PFA) to make the font from, so it is using the default of font.ps, which isn't in your directory. Use 'makeOTF -f Parallel Histories.otf' and it should work, though I would take out the space in 'Parallel Histories', as you may have to escape the space on the command line. Taking out the space would mean that your makeOTF command would be 'makeOTF -f ParallelHistories.otf'.\n\n"
