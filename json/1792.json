This thread is now buried in the archives, but I would like to revive it solely for the purpose of pointing out that _there are no sexy letters in the Latin script._ At least, not compared to these sinuous, copulating beauties from the Buginese, or Lontara, script.   \n ![Buginese](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017074646im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19165.gif)\n\n",

I was comuting at the time to CT and on the train a business man who did alot of traveling to the far east asked me if I knew what the Dragon symbol ment. I told him I didn't. He told me it was a symbol of a gang and if I went into the wrong part of town I could get shot. I stopped wearing that jacket to work.\n\n"
