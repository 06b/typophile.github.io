  "content": "Ok, hey everyone! My first post.\n\nIm really looking for help, ideas and suggestions.  \nI’ve got to write an essay thats 5,000 words long for my last year at University.  \nI have chosen typography because I god tarn’ love it. THE PROBLEM IS,  \nI can’t settle on an argument or a compare contrast theme. I was supposed to come up with a title and a subtitle, but cant settle on one thats worthy of 5,000 words. (Plus I did rubbish on my essay this year)\n\nSO HERE IT IS\n\nI need a title and sub title and an area of typography to base it on. Im begining to think maybe I should have chosen something else. Perhaps you guys can proove me wrong?\n\nAnyway thanks for reading my post, and I look foward to any ray of light anyone can offer. Thanks.\n\n [‹ Stationery content typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007162657/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35276 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type Design tutorial anywhere? - How to create fonts? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007162657/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35134 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I can’t think what I would like to write about, Im drawn to Herb Lubalin. I like ideas and designing with typography. I love the animated title sequences of Saul Bass, the wit of Paul Rand, Tschiholds layouts... Marinettis designs, Avante Garde movements. Yet I dont know what to argue about?\n\n"

You could easily write about how Bass — through typography — set the stage, even the mood — for so many classic motion pictures so that viewers are sucked in, set up and surprised before the film even “gets started,” in their minds (we type geeks realize, of course, that the power of typography can do all that and more, often on a subconscious level, while most people think they’re waiting for the action).\n\n"
