The values in the argument shown work about right for small caps, but I'd usually want a little more for full caps.   \n   \nTIA, Charles\n\n",

This particular item is under 6a (GPOS lookup type 1).   \n   \nThe first number is the adjustment to the glyph's position in x, and the third is the adjustment to the glyph's advance width in x. So in the example, the glyph is moved to the right by 5 units, and the advance width is increased by 10. The net effect is thus to increase both sidebearings by 5 units.   \n   \nI don't know that anybody's done it, but I see no technical reason at the font-building level why you couldn't have multiple \"arguments\" to have one for small caps as well. But....   \n   \nAdobe applications supporting 'cpsp' do so automatically when \"all caps\" formatting is applied, and don't offer any other way to apply it AFAIK. So I doubt that 'cpsp' on the small caps would ever get accessed.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

I think, it is just the other way around. Without additional spacing text that is set in capital letters drags more attention. The cpsp feature just shall make the text that is set in capitals or small capitals more legible. If the user wants to drag attention with the help of more letterspacing like 200 units, he should do that manually. And it is harder to correct the kerning between letters, if a feature that you cannot turn of enlarges the capital letter spacing by 200 units.\n\n--------\n\nPlease correct me, if I am wrong!\n\n"
