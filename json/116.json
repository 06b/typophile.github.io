Surely, you have a future....;)   \nYou found typophile and that's a good start.   \n   \nWith \"gimmick\" fonts...one suggestion...   \ndon't attempt to repeat the gimmick   \non all the letters.   \n   \nBtw, in this case,   \nby \"gimmick\" I mean the wavy round structure.   \n   \nIt can work on some letters, but on the H, I, J, L, T...   \nit gives a person vertigo.   \n   \nWhat program are you using, just curious.   \n   \ngood luck and try back with some other stuff.   \n   \n   \nbj\n\n"

Probably they must have more points in common to have more coerency betten the two parts, its my suggestions. Good luck for the work.   \nRegards / um abra\n\n"
