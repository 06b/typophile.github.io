  "content": "hi everybody\n\nI need some help and i hope someone can help me.\n\ni have a new imac intel and i am trying to install robofab but for some some reason i can not make python work. I probably did a mess:  \nfirst I installed python 2.5.1. Then I realized that robofab needs the python 2.3.3, I installed it but it didn´t work. So then I trashed everything and then re-installed python 2.3.3 but during the installation I got an error message about preferences that I should delete first in order to use robofab, but I can't find this preference archive.  \nIs there any way of going back to the beginning?\n\nhope someone has any idea about it. thanks!\n\n",

I guess it didnt want to work under my 2.4, and by writing python 2.3 it activates the right python when installning... eh... or something.\n\nI read it at the Robofab installation instruction.\n\n"

Check the directory that it's trying to install the robofab.pth file to and see if your user has permissions to write there:\n\n`/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages`\n\nLocate that folder and Get Info on it and in the details at the bottom of the Info window, if it says that you only have read access, click the lock icon and give your user Read & Write access.\n\nThat'll at least get the robofab.pth file installed, but you may still need to copy it into the site-packages folder for an older installation of Python.\n\nAndy\n\n"
