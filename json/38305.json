  "content": "hey,\n\nI am trying to figure out the two fonts used in this poster. I thought the first was Glypha, but the A and E are different, as well as other small differences. Also, does anyone have an idea what the 'SHOW 2006' font is? I have been trying to find a font like this for a while, but i don't really know what that style of font is called? Bubble or something? Haha, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n-josh\n\n[http://www.baster.nl/druk/uploads/2006/07/show2006\\_poster.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114053111/http:/www.baster.nl/druk/uploads/2006/07/show2006_poster.jpg \"http://www.baster.nl/druk/uploads/2006/07/show2006\\_poster.jpg\")\n\n",
