I need at least a book and bold weight with italics and prefer to have small caps if possible. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for the replies.\n\nI actually proposed Minion on the first comps. Unfortunately, the client wants something \"snazzy\" and \"modern\". I have looked at Eidetic Neo, but some of the letterforms in the italic set are hard to get used for some of the people I am trying to please. You know, they want a contemporary classic serif-sans-serif in a dainty heavy weight. Everything looks like Times to them so there's probably not much use in scouring the earth looking for the perfect serif face to compliment the \"invisible\" Helvetica.\n\nAnyway, thanks for all the help.\n\n"
