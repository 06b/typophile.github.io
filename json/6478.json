  "content": "Influenza, whose name means 'the flu' in a number of languages, is a fat, single weight typeface. It's a bastard typeface, each character stands alone as an independent angular structure. Some characters have stylised blackletter features, some are quasi-bitmapped, some are blends between upper and lower case. This also inspired the name since the flu virus changes every time it comes around, it's a new disease every time you have to stay home under the covers drinking hot tea.   \n   \nInfluenza is available for Mac and PC through Kenn Munk's website [www.kennmunk.com/fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015113929/http:/www.kennmunk.com/fonts) at the discounted price of 15$ from the launch date, September 1st through to September 19th. After that, it'll be available for 26$ through kennmunk.com and Myfonts.com.\n\n",
