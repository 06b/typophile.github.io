  "content": "hello everyone,  \nI am doing a major project in \"Emotion in Typography\".  \nHow typefaces represent different emotions, how can one say that Comic sans is a fun font, what are the feature which make it \"FUN\".  \nI am learning about different types of emotions.I am studying Navras( nine emotions)  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa\\_(aesthetics).  \ni want to know how emotions can be searched in a font ?\n\n",

What shapes look masculine or feminine? Bold or subtle? Formal or casual? Static or active? And so forth.\n\n"

      "content": "thanks..  \ni have started my project by studying 9 emotions. After that i will select fonts from different categories like serif, sans-serif, script, display and slab serif and start studying about there anatomy .  \nhow these emotions can be searched in a font. i have found 4 methods for it  \nElimination-if i remove some feature from a typeface.is there any effect?  \nAddition- if i add some feature to a typeface.what kind of feeling it gives?  \nparing method- if i have two type faces and comparing them.  \nestablished font- there are some fonts which already have emotion to it.like i quote the example of comic sans..studying those fonts.  \nsituation-emotions are related to situation.If i change the font on a b'day card from script to slab serif. what effect it will produce.  \ni have just reached upto this level..  \ni dont knw how to proceed further..  \nCan you suggest me some research paper on emotions in typography or some books related to it\n\n"

Isn't that the same question?\n\nOr, staying with type, how many novels are set in a sans-serif typeface in the States, esp. from a large New York publishing house? How about in Germany? So, if you asked a question about sans-serif fonts in the different countries, wouldn't you expect different answers? Or isn't \"comfort\" a significant element in any \"emotion\"?\n\nEtc.\n\n"

The journal Visible Language might be a good place for you to start as it is a bit easier to read that most peer-reviewed scientific journals in that is is also geared towards a design population. If your academic institution has certain database access you may want to read:\n\nBrumberger, E. (2004). The rhetoric of typography: Effects on reading time, reading comprehension and perception of ethos. _Technical Communication 51(1)_, 13–24.\n\nBut this might not be for you, unless you are interested investigating things from a scientific or empirical perspective.\n\nBe mindful however, knowing how to conduct a proper literature review is critical to being able to conduct thorough research. You never know who or what might be providing you with misinformation…\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not sure how \"elimination\" and \"addition\" will help you. The \"pairing\" method you mentioned (comparison of different fonts) might be helpful.\n\nRemember that most people are not typography experts, and any emotions they get from fonts will just be a quick gut reaction based on the general look of the font. (Does the font look formal? Casual? Wild? Precise? Modern? Old fashioned? etc.)\n\nAre you a design student? Have you taken courses in typography or graphic design?\n\n"
