  "content": "This is a natural antidepressant designed for effectiveness rather than minimal side-effects, to be sold in shops. I'm looking for a sans for packaging and a serif for an unusually full and friendly guide to usage, accompanying a titling sans that would ideally be the same as that for packaging, so the two need to pair well. The guide will include a course of boiled down cognitive/behavioural therapy and be more of a little book than an ordinary medication insert.\n\nThe packaging sans must be readable and recognisable from a distance, and of suitable character - whatever you think that should be: I'm interested in what you would want if you needed such a product. The serif should be inviting but authoritatively non-contemporary - certainly not in the least po-mo or cute - and surprisingly beautiful. Though it shouldn't be as rootedly and obviously historical as a Caslon, actual great age isn't a problem.\n\nI'd be really grateful for ideas; I haven't, after much searching, found a good solution yet.\n\n",

Hell, it's even a good name for an anitdepressant.\\*\n\nFor the documentation, I presume it is something more user friendly than the usual tightly folded pamphlet in microscopic print that typically comes with prescription drugs (a serif font would not be suitable there). Give Leawood a shot.\n\n\\*(Of course, naming drugs has to be done very carefully, such that one can't be mistaken for another even when written in a doctor's handwriting.

      "content": "I think the actual purpose of this thing is more important than the fact it's a medication. Imagine you're a genuinely depressed non-designer: for weeks or months things your chest has ached with psychosomatic misery; you can no longer remember or imagine feeling pleasure, but can still feel relief; you'd rather not see your doctor to get a prescription antidepressant, and you drag yourself to the chemist perhaps to get some of that St John's Wort you've heard about, but quite likely for some other reason. What would you go for: a box labelled Zibexoline set in Daxline, or another called Soul Healer set in, at an extreme, Storm Sebastian? It's a genuine question, and the answer might lie between the two.\n\nGerard Unger is interested in people's attitudes to medication, and they're usually terrified of them, finding their inserts - set in Times, Helvetica or Frutiger - particularly inhuman (too authoritarian, too distant, too ignoble?). This must go double for any psychiatric medication, which is one reason for the popularity of \"natural\" treatments.\n\nI reckon inserts also fail to answer most of the questions people want to ask: what exactly is this doing to me, and why? What might I feel like, in all respects, at first, and for how long? Does this fade out gradually or suddenly, and does it coincide with a similar transition to wellness? How will I feel in the long term? What's the likelihood of each side-effect? What's the likelihood of the medication's working, wholly or partially, and when will I know? What should I do if it doesn't work at all or in part, or if it feels too strong, or if I do suffer from common or rare side-effects?\n\nSo the guide will be detailed, authoritative but not authoritarian, kindly and concerned but not presumptively and joshingly intimate, and noble-spirited; it will be immaculately set in some suitable and, as I've said and in particular, _surprisingly_ beautiful serif with sans titling. But which? To give an indicator, even Deepdene might not be too much for the serif.\n\n"

With Haarlemmer Sans? For the name, \"Soul Healer\" is probably a bit much, too: \"Mood Healer\" is perhaps better: it at least cuts straight to the point. Other ideas are very welcome.\n\nActually this is my own product: I'm aiming to start a little company to produce it, having come to learn far too much about the psychopharmacology and biological psychiatry of mood disorders following my own rather in-depth experience of one of them. Trying many medications without success may have biased me; perhaps the suffering is less, and the expectation of reasonable but not total efficacy greater, for most people considering a non-prescription antidepressant.

Based on studies of a combination with the same mechanism of action as two of my components have, it should be effective for at least 60-70% of even clomipramine- or phenelzine-resistant people, and it's getting that mechanism from a herbal extract plus an amino acid that's my hopefully patentable big idea.

Type choices are an integral component to be sure (and much beloved by us all). However, I think it is a mistake to say, \"I'm designing for a children's clothing line... let's start by selecting a font.\" I realize you're giving us additional info here, but what would be most helpful is to see your design direction. We need to know what your idea is. Show us your bottle, is it tall and skinny, is it short and stubby. Tell us about the illustration you're going to use. Is the emphasis NATURAL anti-depressant or is it natural ANIT DEPRESSANT? These will decide what the type choice should be.\n\nFor example: You can sell tea using Priori ala Tazo, or you can sell tea using Helvetica ala Stash, or Windsor Bold ala Celestial Seasonings. These packaging solution accomplish a design goal and carve out a niche on the shelf. I doubt Sandstrom design started with Priori. Maybe, but more likely they started with a direction: the language of alchemy applied to brewing tea. And the results are much stronger for it I think.\n\nIn other words:  \nBembo could work.  \nSauna could work.  \nBeorcana could work.  \nOr they could all flop.\n\nThe more you give us, the more we can help.\n\nGood luck!  \nRandy\n\n"

The commonest requests among patients coming to a doctor about their depression for the first time is for a \"potent\" or \"mild\" antidepressant - which it more often I don't know - even though there's no such distinction among first-line antidepressants (and no possibility, unless they're bipolar, of euphoria).  \nIt seems that it's products about which customers have no fear of side-effects or overkill, like (ridiculous) branded ibuprofen, that are most likely to be packaged as hardcore.\n\nHere's a pic of the kind of thing the image could be like.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018233123im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Wheat%205%20small%20edited_4985.jpg)\n\nText will be in the sky, of which there should be more, covering the top half and a bit of a large 3x2x2 card pack about the width and height of a small paperback.

There are about a dozen naturals with extremely promising results in rats, making them potentially much more efficacious than St John's Wort, say, but with no safety record in humans. I've not considered using them.\n\nThomas, the UK is slightly stricter than the US, and bans nutraceuticals common there which are known to be potentially unsafe, like Kava Kava. More efficacy and safety studies would be lovely, but the cost for naturals is exorbitant. No little company can afford the literally hundreds of millions of dollars spent on trials that the FDA requires for new prescription antidepressants, no pharmaceutical company is going to do the work, and, in the UK, NHS research on naturals accounts for only 0.1% of their total medication research budget. Nonetheless, there are small trials in the West and trials from Russia, substantial data from real-life use, investigation in hospitals of the sources of any med-induced problems, and impressively thorough academic investigation in China where 'alternative' medicine is of course mainstream. We know, for instance, exactly how many cases of liver toxicity have been attributed to Baikal Skullcap there over the last thirty years (4, out of hundreds of millions of patients), and whether there is any inherently liver-toxic compound in the herb (no; problems are due to exceptionally rare genetic abnormalities).\n\nOn the other hand, almost all nutraceutical formulae for the treatment of specific medical conditions are either fraudulent (especially with standardization claims), incompetent (bunging in everything with any far-Eastern reputation, randomly dosed) or only minimally effective (if only through inadequate dosing).\n\n"

On reflection I think the problem is that there is no difference in importance between your two words, but there is a difference in case, so the difference in case raises a subliminal question in the mind of the reader that there isn't any answer to.\n\nAlso the old style numerals here look too big, giving the number of capsules too much importance, as if the fact that there are 168 rather than 150 is a big deal.\n\nIt may also be that some kind of further treatment of the Bliss--a fine outline stroke?--might help. It is lovely, but not quite 'there' is my feeling.\n\nStill, if you don't find a better solution, this is good enough to go with.\n\n"

Use the hollow arrow tool to select the top portion (leave the bottom two points) and then move it up to match the height of the other numerals.\n\nI think this label looks great.\n\n"
