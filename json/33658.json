Perhaps only Typophiles would note that all the other fonts they chose to list under \"Helvetica's rivals\" were of British origin. A coincidence?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123122043im_/http:/typophile.com/files/helveticas_rivals_6046.png)\n\n",

Granted, Times and TNR are based largely on Plantin, so I see why you may say they're \"not particularly British\" but TNR is definitely made by a Britishman. It's probably more \"British\" since it was commissioned for the Times of London newspaper.\n\nOn another note, I didn't know Verdana was a rival for Helvetica... on the internet maybe, but not in print!\n\n"
