Well, I guess he does have to decide on the default. But including both makes this a very versatile face.\n\nI think the main decision to make is whether this should pretend to be a text face. I would avoid that. Didones only succeed in text if they have [significantly less contrast](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015092819/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_bodoni_six_std_book/), and extreme contrast (along with its stylized terminals) is key to Squidot's charm.\n\n"
