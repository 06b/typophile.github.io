Other than the wonderful Ampersands for Haiti project, they seem to be in a coma. Last year, the somewhat ho-hum TypeCon program was barely posted before the event and this year is no better. By now, everyone should know who the speakers are and what the conference will cost. A Professional organization should be run, well, professionally.\n\nIt takes a lot to get me to bitch on a public forum but sometimes only the squeaky wheel gets oiled.\n\nChris\n\n",

It will be held a the end of August in Los Angeles, California. We're really excited about the location. LA has a great design community and so many good schools. We're working hard to re-vamp the education forum and to make this the best conference ever.\n\nAt the end of January, the Font Aid project distracted us quite a bit. We made an effort to put the project together quickly. We still plan to post the PDF speciman book to Lulu.com for people to print-on-demand.\n\nNow that the Font Aid project is wrapping up, we're more focused on conference logistics and we plan to get more details to everyone very soon. We appreciate people being patient. The board members are all volunteers with busy day jobs, but we all care very much about SoTA and Typecon and want to see the organization thrive for many years to come.\n\nMichelle\n\n"

This year will mark my eighth TypeCon. From my own experience, any delay which prevents getting important information out to the community can often be a source of frustration.\n\nSpeaking of delegation, one of my goals as a board member is to increase the number and the quality of these communications, particularly related to email blasts. We will be getting more information out to the community much faster and on a more regular basis as we move forward. I am dedicating a fair amount of my time specifically to this task.\n\nI would also like to echo Juliet and Michelle’s statements that SoTA is actively working on several TypeCon-related announcements and updates. The general call for speakers (along with a call for the education forum) will be posted and delivered within the next week or so.\n\nNaturally, any additional suggestions are always welcome.\n\n(Thanks for squeaking Chris.)\n\nGrant\n\n"

We've had several people already approach us this year who are well known in the Typographic community, but who have never spoken at Typecon. We're excited to have fresh faces on the program, but I don't think we can announce any names yet. I know that's a tease, but I don't want to make announcements until proposals are approved and people are 100% committed.\n\nWe're also putting together some great panel discussions including one Juliet is working on about post-graduate Typographic education in the US.\n\nFeedback on our previous conferences is always welcome. After each conference we spend many hours discussing the conference, what worked and what didn't. As far as content we try to keep a delicate balance between history and technology, academia and industry. We're always curious how people feel about this balance and how we can improve.\n\nMichelle\n\n"

We generally require that volunteers commit to 3 days of volunteering. The main conference sessions always start on Friday and we generally need the most volunteer help on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday before that. I've been the volunteer coordinator for the last 3 years. We formalized the process a bit last year and required volunteers to submit an application. I haven't updated the application for Typecon 2010, but hope to get it out soon. With students, it's sometimes hard to pin them down too far in advance.\n\nFor students who aren't able to volunteer, we offer discounted rates. In the next week, we'll also be announcing a new student award that we're really excited about.\n\n"

RSS (and the twit’s RSS, Twitter) will get the word out.\n\nEssentially, nobody’s asking you to typeset a brochure in InDesign just to tell us what’s coming up in the next conference.
