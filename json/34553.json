      "content": "I echo what Christian said.\n\nAdditionally you might want to know that many things that are totally okay in illustrator in terms of point placement, Bezier angles, etc are not going to be so okay in a font. That is because the engine that interprets illustrator files is much more complex than the many & various engines that interpret font files. Disregarding this reality can cause weird bugs, printing errors or even no printing. Fontlab is more 'constrained' to help you keep your font from being a menace. ;-)\n\nIf you are going to just make one font you can look up Adam Twardoch's tutorial/explanation about how to make your letterforms go from Illustrator files into Fontlab and skip some of the learning curve. You will probably want to run some Fontlab scripts/routines on your outlines though. Like 'place points at extrema' & Maybe 'simplify' & so on. That will help.\n\nHowever, if you want to make say... 5 fonts or more I suggest you embrace the learning curve and go 'all Fontlab'.\n\nThe other thing is yo might want to post some samples on Typophile for technical critique. Or other kinds if you want that too.\n\n"

In this situation is it a case of having to center the slash by eye or is there a method of centering the slash on top the O gylph.\n\nThe soultion I was using involved placing the slash as a seperate glyph and then adding that glyph as a compent which I could then center, then decompose and finally deleting the slash gylph. I'm sure there must be a better method than this.\n\nRr\n\n"

      "content": "Rachel,\n\nIt sounds as if you are new to type design. Once you are in the mindset to make a typeface (as opposed to simply drawing a bunch of outlines), more and more of FontLab will make sense. I repeat what I've said here many times before: You find FL difficult because you're used to Illustrator. But Illustrator can't make a font. FL can do everything. The simple solution is to commit; go through the learning curve with FontLab and discover the many many advantages to having all your type design tools in one place. Once you've got experience with both, you discover that niether is \"better\" or easier to use; it's just a dead end to keep drawing letters in Illustrator when you have to move them to FL to make a font anyway. Aligning, spacing, kerning, are all operations so basic to type design, and yet you can't do them in Illustrator. Don't believe that the same operation won't be as simple in FL; it's just that you're comfortable in Illustrator right now. In a week of intensive use you can get comfortable with FontLab.\n\nMaking an accented character is typically a more methodical process. Accents are useful for more than one accented character: make an accent and then use it in composites for a whole bunch of accented letters (agrave egrave igrave ograve ugrave etc.). You don't ever have to decompose them, and it's a time-saver to have the accent by itself, available as an ingredient to make more accented characters from. Composites allow you to make changes to the accent or to the base character that are propagated in the composite character. If you use your current method you would re-do a lot of work.\n\n"

If not, the counter has a \"center of gravity\" i.e. a point such that if you cut the counter in straight line through it, both parts have the same area, the same \"amount of white\". If you select a few points on the boundary of the counter and get their center of gravity, it won't be that of the counter. Moreover, even if you have a program that gives you with mathematical precision the center of gravity of the counter, as soon as you draw a thick line through it, the two white pieces in general stop having the same area, i.e. the same amount of white and I understand (please correct me if I am wrong) that what is important is that the amount of white under and below the slash be the same. Moreover, other issues due to the [Poggendorff optical illusion](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013025736/http:/www.michaelbach.de/ot/ang_poggendorff/index.html) need to be taken into account.

Partly, there is the visual illusion Briem notes where eg the bar of the H (or the O slash) has to be higher than the center to make the top and bottom look equal. But more than this I think we react as if the letter is an object with weight, and things are more physically stable when the top looks smaller, not equal. Whatever the reason this holds with many horizontally divided characters, such as the B, S etc. Visual equality is what you may want in an H or O slash, but often not in an E and 8, etc. In almost every character, the mathematically simplest shape and proportion looks awkward or ungainly.\n\n"

      "content": "Drawing letters in Illustrator is very simple if you have lots of practice. I've been doing it since 1989 on a Mac of little substance. If you have the \"eye\" for it, you need not use many beziers, only the minimum necessary.\n\nI have worked with artists who use many to quite a few bezier points, so I know what many of you might be suffering through. I would love to give lessons on the minimalization of the bezier-drawn letter. It is so easy once learned.\n\nHaving said that, how well would a letter with the minimum number of beziers transfer to Fontlabs? I am interested in creating some of my own ideas.\n\n"
