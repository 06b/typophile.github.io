On this layer (on each page) draw a box that covers all artwork and images and textmaterial (in other words: the whole page). Give this a fill of 1% Black and make it Transparent.  \nNow export to PDF as usual. All text and vectorimages will be rasterized.\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

Acrobat will then let you save that as a rastered, multi-page PDF.\n\n"

      "content": "Yet another method would be to export to PDF, then in Acrobat do Save As. Change file type to JPEG and adjust the settings to your liking. The only problem with this method is that it leaves you with a separate JPEG file for each page. To get those back in a PDF, you would have to make a new InDesign document and place the JPEGs onto each page, then export as PDF. Just make sure not to downsample too much. All that compression will not be good for your art.\n\n"
