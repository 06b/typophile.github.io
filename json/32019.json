      "content": "As Richard suggested, I prefer to mix styles when setting TOCs; that is, if the chapter titles are in italic, folios are not, etc. It helps to clearly define that the folios are not part of the chapter titles, especially if you’re going to set the two close together.\n\nOn the other hand, contrary to Richard’s suggestion about setting the folios flush-right under the “s” from “Contents,” no, no, no. I’ll never understand why people insist on stretching this relationship and thus straining the reader’s eye to connect titles to folios; just because that’s how it was done for a very long time does not make it a good idea.\n\nOne possible and simple solution is to throw the folios on the other side of the titles. Create 2 tab stops, one to set the folios flush-right, and another to set the titles flush-left, like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/Contents_6505.gif)\n  \n&nbsp;  \nHowever, this option would screw with the right-thrust of the overall design, so it may not be appropriate in this case.\n"

Every literate adult in Western Civilization can look at that page and know what it is without needing it spelled out. But if you do decide to leave it there, Futura and that serif are worlds apart and the effect they have on each other is cacophonous. Futura comes in enough weights that you can break things up just fine without needing to throw another font into the mix.\n\n"

A designer I learned a lot from (John Menapace) said the only reason to line them all up was to make it easier to sum them. Why pander to compulsive behavior?\n\n"
