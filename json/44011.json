  "content": "Hi everybody. I’m working on one of 3 routes for a pitch for a UK government initiative to assist those who have been out of work due to disability, illness or personal circumstance, to get back into work. Although I have my own reservations about the suitability of such a device, the route I am working on uses a cartoon-esque character to convey the message. The character strives to be friendly but not patronising. Whether it achieves this ain’t up for discussion. I do need some typographic advice though! I’m currently using Gill Sans Bold, which although perfunctory in this execution, feels uninspired. I played with some marker-pen type forms but this gave the piece a teacher-feel, which is a big no-no. The type should be direct, clear, bold, simple, unfussy and friendly. The demographic includes the aforementioned unemployed and various health professionals. Anybody got any suggestions? Time is of the essence! Thankyou.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [comp1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415140155/http:/typophile.com/files/comp1.jpg) | 33.91 KB |\n\n [‹ Typeface for Magazine Subheads](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415140155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44021 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [InDesign CS3 styles ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415140155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43972 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
