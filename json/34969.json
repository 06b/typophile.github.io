  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am developing a new logo for my [web design business](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122657/http:/www.designbits.de/). I am using the font Frutiger (my all-time favourite) but I’m not quite happy with it. I would like to put more emphasis on the “d” and “b”, and I wonder if there’s another font that’s better up for the job. What I have in mind is a font with rounded “d”s and “b”s, i.e. without any serifs, so both letters look more like swooshs rather than letters. Can anybody suggest what font to use or maybe come up with a better idea on how to make a good logo out of this term? Thanks for any input...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122657im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_db2_3648.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_db2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122657/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_db2.png) | 3.32 KB |\n\n [‹ Art Advisory Logo modification](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122657/http:/typophile.com/node/36647 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Need some kerning assistance ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122657/http:/typophile.com/node/36558 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’s best to strive for ’sufficiently adequate’ and let it be, as if you don’t, you’ll forever be focused on your logo to the detriment of getting everything else up and running. Kind of the cobbler’s kid’s syndrome.\n\nSo, what you have is fine. Maybe let it rest and spend some time working on the ancillary branding elements like your web site layout and stationery and the like.

I think that logos should not necessarily try to represent the qualities or skills of a company too obviously, in this arena (web design companies) I would suggest that a simple well-drawn logo does set it apart from those that have had a batch of filters thrown at it. I am not a fan of Frutiger, although I would find it hard to define the reasons for my dislike but taking your post as a start I would loosen all the kerning and then work on the positioning in the panel.\n\nTim\n\n"

My own take on it is that it reminded me straightaway of [simplebits](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122657/http:/www.simplebits.com/). I think it’s more the name than the execution, although the fonts are quite similar. Although the name is friendly, so I think the all lowercase wordmark supports this and gives a friendly feel.\n\nDon’t overwork it for the sake of it, you could have a minimal wordmark, but use another part of the branding to make it stand out - think about use of colour.\n\nIt goes without saying, but if it’s for a web design company, it’ll be used online predominently. That reason alone is enough to keep it simple because being used small at 72dpi makes the logo work hard.\n\nSi\n\n"

But, that said, it’s likely just because simplebits is well known in that small world of pro web designers, so it’s likely not a huge issue.\n\nI like Roberts small-capping of the ’BITS’ part, though the line seems arbitrary and unnecessary. Like Duckworth says, no need to overwork it (though I admit that’s hard to do when working on your own logo...it’s like an itch that just can’t be scratched...)\n\n"

I fully agree with Aluminium in that making a logo for oneself is one of the hardest things to do. I’ve designed a few logos already and found every single one them about 10 times easier than this one (the one for my own business) !\n\nThose of you who spotted some similarities with SimpleBits are right too. In fact I’m a huge fan of Dan Cederholm and visit his site regularly (I even bought his book “Bulletproof Web Design” which is a great read by the way). Anyway, I wasn’t aware that my surfing behaviour would have such an impact on the design of my new logo!!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122657im_/http:/typophile.com/files/designbits_5801.png)\n\nIn my new design I decided to add a box containing the letters d and b to make the logo even more recognisable. However, I feel that there isn’t enough linkage between the box and the type. Can anybody suggest ways on how to link those two elements more tightly? I have already applied a subtle background shadow to both elements but this alone won’t do the trick...\n\nAlso, why are some people suggesting to increase the kerning? That will make all letters wider, won’t it? Not only the “it” bit... Also, how can I “visually center the type”?\n\n"

      "content": "The dice looks more like a projection than a perspective drawing, the bottom left and right corners of the hexagon need to move up shortening the left and right sides.\n\nKerning is used to achieve an apparently equal space between characters, one way of seeing this is to squint at the image on a printout (upsidedown can help to stop the characters being apparent as characters) currently you will see a darker area under the crossbar of the t, ‘it’ especially, in the open counter of ‘n’ and slightly in the area where the open counters of the ‘e’ and ‘s’ meet; because of your admiration for Frutiger you probably don’t want to alter the characters to alter that, although it can be done, I would approach the kerning in two ways; taking the ‘gnb’ spacing as optimum and trying to make the spaces similar or the ‘it’ or a combination of the two.\n\nBy ‘visually centred’ I meant that where there is a curve on the ‘d’ there is a relatively straight side on the ‘s’ so although it might be mathematically centred it should shift a touch to the left to appear centred.\n\nTim\n\n"
