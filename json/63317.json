Are the fonts too busy? I feel like the entire thing is rather dense, but like i said before, maybe it's just me.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818192018im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bcard_3423.png)\n\nThanks guys!  \nR//R  \n [http://web.me.com/kyleleitch](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818192018/http:/web.me.com/kyleleitch \"http://web.me.com/kyleleitch\")\n\n",

      "content": "Hi,\n\nI think the whole piece has a pretty vintage 1900's kind of feel to it, which is cool. Was this your intention? I think the calligraphy looks pretty good (although I get strong Coca-Cola feelings with it, but maybe that's just me). I think the word 'brand' is not in the right place, it feels like an afterthought to the calligraphy. I think you should try to integrate it more with the calligraphy. The 'designs...' texts could be moved a bit further away from the calligraphy. Give it a bit more air. And you might want to look into the colors a bit, as I feel they are not completely matching.\n\nGood luck!\n\nJeffrey  \n [infraordinaire](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818192018/http:/www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress)\n\n"

Indeed, I was trying to go for more of a vintage look, and I agree it does have a little bit of a Coca-Cola feeling which I tried to avoid with the colors and skewing.

I think giving it more air, as you say, will help lighten it up a bit.\n\nR//R  \n [http://web.me.com/kyleleitch](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818192018/http:/web.me.com/kyleleitch \"http://web.me.com/kyleleitch\")\n\n"

If that's not the kind of work you're going to be pursuing or doing, yu might want to consider another approach.\n\nFor me, the treatments on the two fonts don't work well together. You name has a simple (green?) drop shadow behind it, and the rest has a very modern (or maybe more like 1990s) 3D feel to it. I think if you could give the same treatment to both of them, it would be a lot more cohesive.\n\nThe red in your name doesn't pop well on the black background. Maybe try brightening that up?\n\n"

Skewing and distorting text is **the** mark of an amateur.\n\nThe contrast is uneven and the yellow-ish outline makes it worse. The angle of stress is inconsistent; most glaring in the arm on the K and the whole swash underneath. The perspective on the swash is totally out-of-sync with the lettering, making the wide left side look like it's reaching out directly at me, and the Kyle is a few feet behind it. Look at some videos on YouTube about how to write calligraphy, then pay close attention to natural the angle of stress and contrast.\n\nThe colors don't bother me, but the background gradient doesn't match the era. The green shadow is just odd.\n\nI could go on, but I'm starting to feel mean. I hope I helped without hurting your feelings!\n\n"
