  "content": "Hello all, I've recently acquired a beautiful monograph of Dan Winters', released last year by Aperture. The book is set with a very beautiful didone face that I can't quite put my finger on. What's mostly giving me fits is the swash style in the italics. A [cover](http://web.archive.org/web/20100226141619/http:/www.spd.org/0809WIFFDANW611.jpg) image and [interior spread](http://web.archive.org/web/20100226141619/http:/www.spd.org/images/blog/0809WIFFDANW586.jpg), for your consideration. Many thanks!\n\n",
