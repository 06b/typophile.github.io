I’m from Florida and am dying to leave it, but if there’s any Floridians out there that think I should stay, speak up. It would be nice to meet more creative folk close by.\n\nYou could take a look at my completely unfinished and imperfect portfolio/website [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090909024412/http:/www.davidboni.net/) and have a gander at some more work on my Flicker account [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090909024412/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/25538071@N04/) if you’re into that sort of thing.\n\nRight. Thanks for reading. Be seeing you on the forums. Hope everyone’s weekend was well.\n\n",

But you’ll experience more up north or out west.  \nAs a New Yorker who used to work in the fashion biz, I’m biased towards Parsons. You can’t re-create an atmosphere like that in another city.\n\nWelcome and best of luck.\n\n"
