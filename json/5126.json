Unfortunately, I don't know of a digital version of this, but it's the basis of one of Macromedia's custom corporate fonts, so you can get an idea what it looks like from there ads, etc.   \n   \nHere's a scan from an old type specimen book:   \n   \n ![venusBoldExt](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826031630im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37780.gif)\n\n",

As I recall, that was done by Rick Johnson, who often does these amazing technical illustrations for _Model Railroader_ magazine. Not the most faithful version I've seen of a font, but it does have a full character set and decent spacing (not usually true of free fonts).\n\n"

      "content": "Totally agree, Vonnes is very similar to Venus Extrabold Extended, like Dave Jeffery says in this   \n [article](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826031630/http:/www.transdiffusion.org/emc/september/granada/) about fonts in Granada Television:   \n   \n   \n \"There is, however, a very visible variant of Venus (including Venus Bold Extended) in use by Macromedia for their corporate identity. It is called �Vonnes�, and was especially designed for them by Font Bureau. All �Vonnes� really is, is Venus with angular cuts on the letter endings. Being a corporate commission, Vonnes is not available to the public.\"   \n   \n   \nWhat I don't understand is that these lovely typefaces, Venus Bold & Extrabold Extended, that were very used and popular in the 50's and the 60's are not digitized in the right way for public purchase.   \nI tried to find them one year ago for a job and no way, finally I got Annonce Grotesque (very similar to the Extrabold weight) and you know what, now it looks nor even this one is [available any longer](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826031630/http:/www.myfonts.com/Article4978.html)... !?\n\n"

I did one my early business cards with it, although I didn't really know how to use it correctly at the time (way too tight). It used to be you could only get the extended weights and condensed weights, now you can only get the others.\n\n"
