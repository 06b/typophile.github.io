  "content": "Has anyone at Typophile ever designed something to be harder to read on purpose--to make sure the reader slows down, and thus better understands the text? In particular, has anyone ever done this with a textbook or other educational materials? Or has anyone made another design decision with a similar effect, such as printing the text in light gray?\n\nNote: there is some empirical research suggesting that using more difficult typefaces can increase comprehension. Dan Kahneman discusses some of it in Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow, and a very recent example is the new study described here, which finds increased gains for dyslexic readers:\n\n[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10089102/Hard-to-read...](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721201324/http:/www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10089102/Hard-to-read-fonts-can-boost-pupil-results-by-up-to-a-fifth.html \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10089102/Hard-to-read-fonts-can-boost-pupil-results-by-up-to-a-fifth.html\")\n\n",

Maybe Corsiva is more readable because it's an italic, maybe because the letter forms are more differentiated than in Arial. The same results could be argued to just prove the opposite, that Corsiva is more readable and thus the pupils' comprehension was better.\n\nThis study doesn't really hold up to scientific standards.\n\n"

But it's not the only one--I mentioned Kahneman's secondary work, and Chris listed other studies. I don't care about the details of this study (or the dyslexia vs. general population point).

      "content": "A quick review for those who don’t have database access (or don’t want to pay $40.USD to download it).\n\nFor starters, the authour’s and those who administered the tests are middle-school teachers, not research scientists.\n\n**Subjects (Ss)**  \n275 students in Years 9–11 (age range= 13–16 years).  \nMean and standard deviation not reported.  \nSs were previously grouped into four “bands” by Middle Years Information System tests.  \nSome were diagnosed with Dyslexya, but there was no agreed upon definition, nor were they diagnosed by the same person with the same methods. Uncontrolled.\n\n**Experimental design**  \nBetween Ss. Each group of Ss only received one condition (font—Arial or Monotype Corsiva).\n\n**Methods**  \nDouble blind study. Neither the experimenter (a teacher) nor Ss knew what condition they were about to administer/receive. During a 40 minute lesson of students copying material from the blackboard and answering questions from a textbook Ss were stopped, and shown a powerpoint slide. It contained the following text:\n\n> The white dwarf star Amethyst is in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is half the mass of the Sun but has a diameter one hundred times less than the Sun. On its surface it has a temperature of twelve thousand Kelvin. It is mostly made up of carbon. Currently, we have found three planets orbiting  \n> around it.\n\nThe line-breaks can not be discerned from the figure presented in the paper.\n\nSs were given 90 seconds to read the text in silence. The lesson continued. Approximately 35 minutes later, they were administered the following questions:\n\n> 1) What is the name of the star?  \n> Amethyst/Amey/Myethyst/Alpha-Centauri\n> \n> 2) In which constellation is it?  \n> Cassiopeia/Cancer/Capricorn/Pavo\n> \n> 3) What type of star is it?  \n> White Dwarf/Red Dwarf/Red Giant/White Giant\n> \n> 4) How many times the mass of the Sun is it?  \n> Half/Double/Ten Times/Five Times\n> \n> 5) What is the temperature on its surface?  \n> Twelve Kelvin/Twelve Thousand Kelvin/Twelve Thousand Centigrade/Three Thousand Kelvin\n> \n> 6) What is it mostly made up of?  \n> Carbon/Helium/Iron/Cadmium\n> \n> 7) Have we found planets orbiting it?  \n> Yes/No\n\nThey were on paper. Their typographic design is not reported.  \n121 Ss saw Arial, 154 saw Monotype Corsiva.  \nSs were grouped into two groups by random balanced assignment—random assignment followed by re-grouping Ss to ensure that each group had a similar percentage of Ss from all bands, including readers with Dyslexia.\n\n**Results**  \nAcross bands, and including dyslexic readers, Ss who saw Monotype Corsiva scored 12.8% higher. This was statistically significant.  \nWithin bands, excluding dyslexic readers, the mean difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 11.5%. This was statistically significant.\n\n**The interesting part of the results**  \nAcross bands, the difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 12.8%. Within bands, the mean difference was 11.5%. However, when looking at _only_ readers with dyslexia, the difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 19%. While arithmetically different from the overall difference, it was not statiscically significant.\n\n**In one sentence**  \nWhen students with Dyslexia saw a slide with a passage of text set in Monotype Corsiva compared to Arial , they performed significantly better on a short comprehension test, but the _difference_ between their scores was not significantly greater than the difference between the scores of students without Dyslexia.\n\n**In conclusion**  \nA nice short and easy to read article. however, it is full of confounds and impossible to reproduce from the paper. In the concluding remarks of Diemand-Yauman et al. (2010, pp 4), they state “The potential for improving educational practices through cognitive interventions is immense. If a simple change of font can significantly increase student performance, one can only imagine the number of beneficial cognitive interventions waiting to be discovered. Fluency demonstrates how small interventions have the potential to make big improvements in the performance of our students and education system as a whole.”\n\nThis is an great example of non-scientists testing disfluency theory, and a testament at how easy it may be to implement these techniques in real-world settings, for which they should be applauded.\n\n"

So, it was not typefaces that were being compared, but settings, according to the prejudices of the researchers, who rigged the experiment to set one typeface so that it was “harder to read” than the other.\n\nWithout seeing the slides involved here, I can nonetheless state that the Arial setting will look really boring, just the kind of thing that would make students’ eyes glaze over and their minds wander, while the Corsiva setting will have a degree of novelty that warrants more attention.\n\nAs I pointed out in a previous thread, what is being compared is not, as the researchers believe, difficulty of typeface, but appropriateness of type choice and type specs, about which they are somewhat ignorant, because that ain’t their bailiwick.\n\nSo congratulations, they have discovered typography!\n\nThe researchers here are victims of the Beer Test phenomenon: _ **a small amount of something unusual** _ will have immediate highlight appeal, but is not the kind of thing for prolonged consumption. Display Beer, as Hrant termed it.\n\n"
