And not just any poetry, but poetry from one of the greatest poets who ever lived, East or West.\n\nThird, your talent is unstoppable. I haven't met a typeface of yours I didn't like. Your work is worth far more than you charge for it.\n\nThank you for pouring more beauty into our lives.\n\nRahim\n\n"
