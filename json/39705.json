I feel that creating smooth curves in this way leaves me wandering what I am giving away, what I am letting myself being deceived into accepting as ’true’, precisely because they are clean. There’s a funny blandness to smooth bezier curves that inhibits drawing I feel. It takes a while to become confident enough to intentionally throw bumps into the mix. Or maybe that’s simply a case of understanding lettershapes better. I don’t think so. I spent several months painting letters with gouache, and when first drawing by computer, the technology naturally at first inhibited. In fact it did for a long time.\n\n"

But less smooth curves, and even discontinuity are not necessarily design flaws. In the case of the Tim’s S it is, because the design calls for a smooth curve. But other designs call for less smooth curves. Sometimes these are clear corners, but other times they are more complex shapes. If you look at some old style ampersands you will see clear examples. Also Dwiggens introduced discontinuities where they weren’t traditionally. And you can see also these in Kent Lew’s beautiful Whitman, influenced by Dwiggens.\n\nIt is less clear, but more accurate to say that you shouldn’t have discontinuity except where it serves a design purpose. And then it can be very good, if the design is good.\n\n"

How it is constructed matters to me. If there are kinks and quirks in a curve, do they work aesthetically, or are they the result of inattention to detail? Could you demonstrate that a typeface was well or poorly drawn by “reverse engineering” it. I know, ultimately what matters is how it reproduces in a given medium, what it looks like and how it “reads”. My medium is mostly cut vinyl.\n\nIf a typeface were specified for a company that is then going to make thousands signs using it, then the quality of the vectors it’s made up of may make a significant difference to down loading, plotting and weeding time on the one hand and on the other perhaps you can just say “this is good (or bad), and here’s why.”\n\nFrom the standpoint of designing type myself, (which I really have not done much of at all and don’t claim anything other than green-horn status) I find the templates I make to construct characters can get very complex, as I want to make sure everything that needs to stay consistent does and sufficient variety and character is allowed and that shapes are constructed in the most elegant and precise manner possible.

Of course, curvature is defined mathematically and can be calculated relatively easily for any point on the outline but you cannot formulate a necessary or sufficient condition in terms of handle lengths.\n\n<cite> The handles between two points on segment?</cite>\n\nIn many cases, in a range between elliptic and slightly hyperelliptic, you can make one handle shorter and the other one longer and you will hardly see any change in the shape of the curve. I have not made any calculations yet as to where this range is and what degree of change in handle ratio is possible within a threshold.\n\nYou can easily test that in FontLab: just draw a slightly hyperelliptic curve element and play with the handle lengths, keeping the curve as close as possible to the original shape. You will notice there is quite a bit of leeway, there is one redundant degree of freedom if you want.\n\n<cite>as the relationship between the handles on two sides of a smooth point?</cite>\n\nThe above partly answers this question: No, the handle ratio on one node is totally irrelevant. It is a common misconception that the handle lengths play a great role.\n\nIf your curve looks un-smooth with bumps or dents and you want to fix that you need shift the nodes. Finding the right position for the extremes is crucial, the relative handle lengths are not so important. Note that in my above example, only the nodes were shifted in order to establish continuous curvature. The handles were merely adjusted to compensate for this so the curves do not get pushed out or in.\n\nIf I have some time I might put my Brighton presentation on Bézier curves on-line with some comments on. That is more detailed and graphic than what I just described.\n\n"

That explains why I have found that often the easiest way to smooth out bumps is to slide the node while keeping the handles fixed. (Shift key in FontLab.) Then if need be I play with the handles, and as a last resort start moving the node at right angles to the line. —All the while keeping the original in the mask layer. The Brighton presentation sounds interesting.\n\nThe relative handle length often only makes a very subtle difference, but it is sometimes a difference between what really looks polished and only OK. The recommendation to equalize handles between nodes, which I have read, I find does seem help if an imaginary straight line connecting the nodes in question is around 45 degrees, but if closer to horizontal or vertical, the curve usually looks better with unequal handles...\n\n"

It is like driving a car through curves—you can drive hard and slam on the breaks before accelerating or you can drive more smoothly. You end up with a more frantic line in the 1st case.

Origin placement has different meanings when it comes to other kinds of digital imaging, but for plotters, there can be a significant time waste if start points are not in ideal locations.\n\nThis is an element of outline quality if you use a plotter, but may not have been on anyone’s radar for years; I think origin point location is essential for TrueType hinting, but not for the same reason.\n\nEfficiency is probably something else that would improve plotting times; fewer points, smoother outlines. But that doesn’t mean the appearance of the letters or art is “smooth” or slick or bland; even rustic or “antiqued” letters can be digitized efficiently. I think there was a typeface by Spiekermann that had rounded corners for the speed benefit in plotting; more continuous curves might give a speed advantage, but you can watch your plotter to see if sharp corners really slow things down. If they do, you can surmise that sans faces are quicker to plot; serifs add a lot of extra direction changes.\n\nRe: visual smoothness and endpoints vs. handles; both can have a visible effect on the “rightness” of your curve; I think it’s a mistake to say that either endpoint location OR handle length is more important to getting a good curve. Plenty of times I slide both handles and the endpoint back and forth to get the curve right. See Mundo Italics for lots of this.\n\nTim, this kind of fiddling is the exact thing you talked about in Brighton; I have spent so much time messing with these shapes precisely because the beziers aren’t behaving well and they need firm control to get them to do what you want. They can easily influence your results.\n\n"

But in context there are, as Tim says such things as bad curves, and his “before” S shows them. There is a certain kind of lumpiness that arises from clumsy Bezier curves, a kind of badness which would not arise with handwritten or draw letters. And in a letter with these lumpy Bezier curves side by side with an improved version almost everyone would say the improved version looks better. So yes, there is such a thing as good curves.\n\n"
