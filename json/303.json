It doesn't actually matter whether the font is for text or display usage, a decent run of text will show up the character and spacing anomalies - short phrases won't.   \n   \nIf you want to go all the way - in an abstract manner - generate every character next to every other. Again the anomalies are apparent.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> spacing first, kerning after.   \n   \nThat will indeed cover you 90%, at least in the mainstream.   \nBut for that last stretch of quality, they really have to be done in parallel (as much as feasible). Certainly, few designers do that, but that's only because even fewer users care.   \n   \nBTW, kerning even affects the letterforms themselves, not just the sidebearings.   \n   \n\\> It doesn't actually matter whether the font is for text or display usage   \n   \n?   \nI think it matters a huge deal.   \nEspecially when you consider, for example, that cap-cap setting is much more common in display. But there are in fact deeper differences between display and text, even in spacing/kerning.   \n   \n\\> generate every character next to every other.   \n   \nThat's of course completely impractical.   \nWhich is exactly why you need \\*both\\* test strings and long \"real\" text to arrive at good results without spending 20 years on it.   \n   \nSo, Andrew: it's not that simple. :-/   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I personally take it very far - like in assigning spacing values to serifs.   \n   \nDepending on how far you take quantification (noting that it has to end somewhere), you'll be left relying on the \"eye\" to different degrees. The more you rely on the eye, the longer it takes, and the more error prone it is. But, again, it's not something to be avoided, just balanced judiciously against the \"math\".   \n   \nRely on real text only when you can't go any further with test strings. There are many reasons for this, not least that your font might be used for a language you don't even know exists.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
