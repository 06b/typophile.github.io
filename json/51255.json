What its all about is a day dedicated to many different cultures and what not.\n\nThe assignment was to focus on the theme of, “Multicultural Day 2009: Cultural Dimensions of Democracy.” I think it turned out awesome, what do you guys think?\n\nThanks,  \nRskate2\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Multicultural-Day.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824111222/http:/typophile.com/files/Multicultural-Day.jpg) | 210.38 KB |\n\n",
