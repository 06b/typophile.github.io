  "content": "Hi. So I'm trying to change the default Devanagari font in chrome by specifying Adobe Devanagari as the default font in chrome. So my CSS code I have is:\n\n`@font-face {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n  src: local(\"AdobeDevanagari-Regular\");\n  unicode-range: U+900-97F;\n}`\n\nNow this will work to swap out the family, but then the OpenType features do not work. Is there anyway to get Chrome to apply the Indic OT features from the font?\n\n",

Currently, complex script rendering is supported on Windows and Linux using OpenType font features while AAT font features are used under Mac OS X. Apple has indicated it intends to support complex script rendering using OpenType font features in the future.\n\nIt seems that to get the functionality I want, I might need to actually upgrade to Lion or Mountain Lion. :^(\n\n"
