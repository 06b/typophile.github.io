  "content": "I have a pal who is an 18th century compartive lit Prof. He is interested in learning more about what innovations and events occur in printing/type during the 18th century. What sources do you think are most helpful and accurate? I should mention that while he is interested to some extent in design shifts, his interest is more literary, social & economic than it is design centered. So information about trade in metals needed and or paper or ink making, or the politics of printing might are fair game too. Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "John Baskerville developed a number of innovations that I only know about tangentially. In addition to controversial typeface designs (and they did seem to be quite controversial in Britain and her colonies), he also developed new kinds of glossy paper, and ink. This allowed him to print with his new types, which on \"normal\" paper would have broken up (too many thins, etc.)\n\nThe French Romain du Roi comes in at the tail end of the 1600s, with the first real type being cut around 1702, I think. That might be too early. The Fournier family must have developed some technology stuff. Didot and Bodoni come along later at the century, although I think that Bodoni's \"innovations\" might happen too late to be purely 18th century (???).\n\nWeren't there attempt to standardize type sizes during this century?\n\n"

      "content": "I believe in England and the American Colonies for the middle part of the century, and till nearly the end (when the colonies became the US), Caslon's types dominated. So the Lit. Professor could look into Caslon's history as well. See the articles by James Mosley in [Journal of the Printing Historical Society](http://web.archive.org/web/20110227111011/http:/www.printinghistoricalsociety.org.uk/). For earlier history and background Harry Carter's ['A View of Early Typography'](http://web.archive.org/web/20110227111011/http:/www.amazon.com/gp/product/0907259219/qid=1134398070/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-3857683-9401545?n=507846&s=books&v=glance) is invaluable. Caslon's types were modelled after Dutch types, and these are another important story for the Continent. And older types continued to be used on the Continent, I believe.\n\nIf your friend really wants to study this in depth, he should contact the [Rare Book School](http://web.archive.org/web/20110227111011/http:/www.virginia.edu/oldbooks/) at the University of Virginia. They have programs, with teachers from around the world, specifically for people with his type of interest.\n\n"

The paper is titled _An Investigation of the Interdependency of Paper Surface, Printing Process, and Printing Types_, and in it there are references to paper refinements of the 18th century (including efforts of John Baskerville).\n\nThis paper was translated into English (by Inga Wennik, a friend of mine) and published with permission in _Fine Print_ magazine, October, 1983.\n\nAt the end of his paper, Caflisch cites his reference material, but you might find this and more in _Fakten zur Schriftgeschichte_, by Max Caflisch, privately printed, Zurich 1972, or his _Schrift und Papier_, Grellingen 1973.\n\n"

His books distinguished themselves by both the silky sheen of their paper surface and the excellent reproduction quality of his types. The German philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg visited his house and shop shortly before Baskerville's death. He was shown punches and matrices but was unable to discover the secret behind the smoothing of the papers. Certain experts believe that the paper was pressed between hot plates made of copper._\n\" \n\nMore theories on Baskerville's method follow, plus the article continues with developments during the times of Bodoni, Jenson, Granjon.\n\n"
