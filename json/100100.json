Show me an older font that it's based on. I like Brushstroke better, but Pennello has more glyphs. \n"

Clearly, Pennello Becker could be derivative of Brushstroke as it appears far muddier in comparison.\n\nIt also seems that Brushstroke Plain is nicely drawn which gives weight to it being an original or at least a legitimate font. Whether it's \"free\" or not ...\n\nps. Don't trust anything written in a font. I predate all my fonts to get \"prior art\".\n\n"

Separately, I have in my notes that Mark Simonson confirmed this as, \"an old metal font called Stop.\" I can't find the post to verify this, though. Mark?\n\nAgain, Hrant, your \"strongly suspect\" is based upon ignorance and a highly dysfunctional gut feeling.\n\n"
