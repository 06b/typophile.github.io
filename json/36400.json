  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m looking for a somewhat modern sans-serif that will go well with a round symbol.\n\nThe company gives out certificates in drug prescription and dozage to nurses. I don’t want a type that has one side too thin. Right now I’m using Utopia, it has a nice thickness too it but it looks too ordinary. Would be could if it had nice small caps aswell.\n\nI’d like to try various versions with more and less notable serifs.\n\nI could poosibly use a sans type too but it can’t be to soft.\n\nOr maybe some slab serifs.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nthanks  \npeter\n\n [‹ Similar Script Face](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193624/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36736 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Justification Rules ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193624/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36691 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Maybe someone wouldn’t call it modern in a strict sense, yet, for me it is.  \nBut attention, I think it costs a lot more! ;-)  \nAnd I believe its worth it.\n\nStefan\n\n"
