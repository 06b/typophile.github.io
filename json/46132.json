  "content": "This work was a study based on a book I’ve been reading (Designing Programmes ISBN: 978-3-03778-093-0) by Karl Gerstner. The two circles side by side represent the ancient MAPPA MUNDI as a answer to the question. I’ve used a simple grid system by having every circle subdivided in for smaller ones ‘inside of each other’. The question big circle is also divided in 8 parts each of 45º. The smaller circles are placed on the axis of the divisions. As for the ‘effect’ on the smaller circles, the first part of the 4 divisions is rotated at 25º, the second one at -25º, to the third is added 10º taking the first as a start and making it a 35º rotation and then the forth (smaller one) is rotated -35º. When we move to the second small circle (or 4 circles to be correct) I start the first with 45º rotation (35º + 10º) and make the same routine as I’ve done before. This allows that the inner circle of the last circle (which is near to the first one) has rotated -175º (very near 180º which is half of 360º that all the circles did around the question). The left big circle is achieved by rotating each of it’s four parts 0º 16º 32º and 64º.\n\nAny one knows and 'uses' this book? I'd like to exchange ideas about this book.\n\nPedro Monteiro  \n [http://whatype.wordpress.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825061510/http:/whatype.wordpress.com/ \"http://whatype.wordpress.com/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825061510im_/http:/typophile.com/files/circulo_6104.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I still think it is a valuable book even though it was born in Modernist tradition. It is more an Ulm system kind of design but the principles are still good. The thing is, it was written prior to computers so now so much of this kind of thing can be automated that it does not seem to have the intrigue it did back when it was written. The danger is that people might use it as a means without an end, making lovely progressions without meaning in communication of the message. There was \"form follows function\" but in this case it may be Form follows Process regardless of function. It is for the user to make it work well, not the technique to dominate.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
