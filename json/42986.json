  "content": "Can someone tell me where I can buy or download the very stylish Old English looking font that the Chicano graffiti artists and tattoo artists use? I noticed a lot of clothing companies and designers are using this style of lettering and I was wondering if anyone has created a font of it. I already have a ton of Blackletter, Old English, and Gothic type lettering. Anyone know where I could buy or download this style of lettering? I attached some examples of what I am looking for. Thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025154823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cholo%20font_4739.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025154823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_2724%20copy_5630.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025154823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/index_01_5356.gif)\n\n",
