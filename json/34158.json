Also if I select the Cap Height figure the small window shows the uppercase H with the red line across the top but should this red line be slightly higher so it touches the top of the uppercase O.\n\nIs it best to set the Cap height and x height in the glyph window by dragging the dotted lines that repersent the Cap and x height.\n\n [‹ first time creating typeFace...](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115033818/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34123 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Illustrator/InDesign/PS tutorials: Never too late to learn more ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115033818/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34142 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

You typically need some talus to avoid collisions  \nwhen leading is zero. But too much talus will make your font  \nless efficient and look discouragingly small on the body.\n\nBTW you don’t <cite>have</cite> to use 1000, although it’s the  \nsafest so if you have no reason not to use it, use it.\n\nhhp\n\n"
