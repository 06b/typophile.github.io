At around age 50 I got bifocals, and immediately I began to have discomfort when working at a computer.\n\nOne day I was talking with an airlines ticket agent [before we made our reservations via computers] and she said “hold on, honey, I’m just back from lunch and I gotta get my computer glasses on.” I right away forgot about the tix and asked her about this. She said her eye doc had prescribed single-vision lenses for looking at the monitor at work.\n\nI went to my eye doc next day and got just that. Right away the discomfort across my shoulders went away. The main problem with this is that I cannot see much beyond my arm’s length. If I forget to take them off when I leave my office, I often walk past other staff members and have no idea who they are unless I see and hear them frequently and know their general shapes and sounds. That’s a problem in a building with a couple hundred employees.\n\nAt the office, looking at a 19” monitor [I forget what make it is], I wear the glasses against my head. Right now, at home working ob a 17” Macintosh laptop, I have to shove them down my nose to see better.\n\nIf bifocals bother you when looking at a monitor, get single-vision lenses just for looking at the monitor.\n\npowers\n\n"

This way I devote all my lens space to the project on the monitor. & since I’m setting books, that means I must also have constant reference to a ms or a set of proofs lying right in front of me. So all is in the same plane when I look.\n\nWhen I want to look out the window to read placards in protest marches going up the street to the state capitol I must put my bi-focals on.\n\npowers\n\n"
