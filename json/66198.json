When generating fonts in FontLab I often get the message:\n\n`[WARNING] The feature file OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do not sum to the font bbox size!`\n\nI assume this has to do with the metrics settings somehow, but no matter how I play around with the metrics this message won't go away.\n\nO ye wise, what is wrong, how did I cause it, and how do I make it go away?\n\n",
