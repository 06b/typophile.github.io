  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have a client who insists that I find the font used in the Goldman Sachs logo. It seems at first like a modern typeface but lacks most of the serifs ... so maybe a transitional?...\n\nAnyhow, I have so far drawn a blank. I realize that parts of the GS logo have probably been hand-tweaked, but if such a font exists that matches \"oldman\" and \"achs\", I will be in much better shape than I am right now.\n\nI really appreciate your all of your expertise and assistance.\n\nCheers!  \n- George\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312203914im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GS_4752.jpeg)\n\n",
