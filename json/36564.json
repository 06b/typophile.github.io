  "content": "Okay, so i have 2 Word issues:\n\n1) I'm generating Windows PostScript Cyrillic fonts. I'm using FLS5, running Win XP SP2. I set the mode in FLS5 to codepages and selected MS Windows 1251 Cyrillic. In the Encoding options, I have chosen \"1251 Cyrillic\" under supported codepages and \"Cyrillic CP 1251\" under Microsoft Character Set (and \"Cyrillic\" for the Mac script). With these settings, The fonts work just fine in Adobe InDesign CS3, but i cannot figure out how the fonts are behaving in MS Word 2007. In Word the fonts generally default to Times New Roman.\n\n2) For OpenType and PostScript (latin) fonts, the bold style-linking is not working correctly in Word 2007. I have linking set up so that Heavy is the bold version of Medium. Does it matter that the bold style weight is not actually bold? Style linking works correctly in TrueType fonts generated using the same files and settings as the OpenType fonts and style linking works for all fonts (PS, OT, TT) in InDesign CS3.\n\nThe fact that these fonts work as expected lead me to believe that these are Word bugs, but i'll be glad to be proven wrong. If any of you can help me resolve these problems, I'd greatly appreciate your help. Thanks for looking!\n\n",

      "content": "1. When you say 'PostScript Cyrillic' fonts do you mean Type 1 or CFF PostScript? I recommend making the latter and supporting both the CP1251 and also the Western European CP1252. Actually, I recommend supporting CP1252 in any font you make.\n\nWord has what I certainly consider a bug which means that even if a font supports a codepage that supports the ASCII Latin subset, such as the Windows Cyrillic or Hebrew codepages, Word will switch to a default font when you try to enter Latin characters from such a font, because it is looking for CP1252 support. You may be able to input Cyrillic characters correctly with your font. Have you tried that? If it is like the issue I hit with Hebrew codepage fonts, the font switching should only happen if you try to input the Latin subset characters.\n\n2. Hmm. This ring a bell, but I can't remember what the issue is. I suspect Adam Twardoch could tell you.\n\n"
