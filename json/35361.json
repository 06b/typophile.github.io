They also do high end routing, demographics reports and sales and marketing consultation. They are presently undergoing a shift. Their main client Aliant has transfered the task of directory distribution to yellow pages. Atcan wishes to use this opportunity to revamp their corporate identity to better reflect who they truly are.\n\nAtcan, a company name which stands for Atlantic Canada, has many decades experience in the field. They use the most current software to accomplish their task and their methods are cutting edge. The also use these tools and skills to offer demographics reports to retailers in the area and they sell their experience through consulting services. They are not a typical service but for the clients they do cater to they are absolutely essential. A meeting with them quickly revealed the culture of professionalism that reigns at the Atcan office.\n\nAtcan’s priority with the design is to shed the fly-by-night look of their existing ID while making it clear what they offer.\n\nTo see the full creative process you can view the thread on HOW.\n\n[click here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081017155103/http:/forum.howdesign.com/tm.aspx?m=275135)\n\nHere is the favored finalist.\n\n[click here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081017155103/http:/i110.photobucket.com/albums/n94/ulysses01/Picture1-3.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081017155103im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-1_5603.jpg)\n\n [‹ Phone Formats?!

It seems this would be an important consideration.</cite>\n\nTake a lesson from the concept here. If not the side of a truck then some other low-end repro method is going to come along. The mark should be simple enough for about any application. Flexo and many offset printers can’t work with a dot lighter than 5%. A gradient that cuts off in a hard line is not attractive. The shape of the letters and the fit will make your point best.\n\n"
