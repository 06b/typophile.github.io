The type he designed for the Aubette Café, De Stijl Magazine, etc. was used as a starting point and then expanded upon. While this typeface was inspired by historical references, it also has the ability to invoke a contemporary feel under the right conditions. Distill will work hard whether you are designing a neo-constructivist poster or a futuristic website. Distill is a family of 12 fonts: 4 weights, each containing condensed, regular, and expanded widths. It also features several alternate characters.  \n [http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0283](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091953/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0283 \"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0283\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091953im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0267_01_3756.jpg)\n\nBandoleer from MADType is a new stencil typeface family. Inspiration for the typeface came from both Art Deco and Military sources. It comes with both a clean geometric and hand drawn version so you don't have to get carpal tunnel sketching it out yourself. This typeface is equally at home stenciled with paint on a wall or used on a music poster.  \n [http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0267](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091953/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0267 \"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0267\")\n\n",
