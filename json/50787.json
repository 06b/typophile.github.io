  "content": "I am looking for use of Granite in Web Design, mostly green granite, specifically in good looking layouts. I have yet to find a single site that uses granite on the web and does not look ancient and/or horribly unappealing. I have also tried to design some with granite on the web for different clients with little success. Any ideas of sites that use Granite as a major visual element and look good?\n\n",
