I recommend the Haab Lettera reproduction, which is superior quality Swiss printing on two pages of glossy paper. The Lambert version is intermediate in quality.  \nI didn't bother scanning any of the versions because the complexity meant that it would not be a candidate for fonting, at least not by me. Also I find the design to be rather clunkly and more of a curiosity than something people would actually use. But that's just my opinion -- perhaps a letter might work as a chapter heading in something like a steampunk context.  \nDon\n\n"
