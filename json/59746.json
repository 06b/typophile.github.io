  "content": "Hello,\n\nThis café is to be named Café Riva at Inverkip Marina, Scotland.\n\nThe proposed identity is fairly modern that uses graphic interpretations of a cup of coffee and yacht sails. You will notice that it uses Avant Garde Gothic alternatives. I love them but have never used them in a logo before.\n\n[http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva-Concept01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201051243/http:/i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva-Concept01.jpg)\n\nThe shop front picture is not the actual café, it’s just an example of how it could look.\n\n[http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva-Concept02.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201051243/http:/i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva-Concept02.jpg)\n\nThis identity is still in development and I have other ideas, but felt this one was the strongest. I would appreciate any constructive comments please.\n\nThanks\n\n",

As it stands, I think it's a little to close to sailboat than coffee. The blue might be the tipping point.\n\nAdditionally, you seem to have left out the accent on the É.\n\nOn a side note, this reminds me of the [VIA Rail](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201051243/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIA_Rail) logo but I hardly think that's a concern all the way in Scotland. Just an observation. If there any old disco fan's that hang out there it might remind them of [Boney M](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201051243/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boney_M.). They used Avant Garde \"alternates\" a lot in their album art.\n\nLastly, I'm old and I don't go to coffee shops.\n\n"

Also, I think the blue shapes surrounding the logo are a little much; the first black and white version feels much stronger as a mark. It works better on the shop signage and the blue line serves well as a graphic element (I really do see that blue line as water now) on the menu etc., but I'd perhaps try incorporating the colour scheme into that first black and white version.\n\n"

If it is a hip, young, disco, fun cafe shop. I think it would be perfect for it.\n\nSet that aside, I agree with Christ & Collin, it does have ocean feel, blue cool breeze water and sail boat. I don't know if it is only just me, but I have hard time to read CAFE, it does look like OAFE.\n\nThe blue line under the text makes it look like the ocean with white sailing boat boat float on top. What if you reverse the color, blue shape fill in the letter, and white background, no underline.\n\nI think you should put some more different version, so everybody can give you some more feedbacks.\n\n"

Have you thought about using a lighter version of the font (which I think would improve the graphic elements) & perhaps giving the 'coffee' a moka colour?

Good to have fresh eyes look at this identity.\n\nI will try out the recommendations and post them here.\n\nInverkip Marina, is one of the largest marinas in the west of Scotland not too far from Glasgow. There is a big sailing community based there along with related industries. The demographic is fairly affulent and the café will be based on a busy road. My cousin works at the marina and he thinks the café should do well. The café is basically a side line for a yacht repair business and will be located at their premises rather than near other shops.\n\nThe café has not been fitted out yet, but it will use modern materials and fittings.\n\nI will post revised concepts shortly.\n\nThanks.\n\n"

Because it is a typeface which violates the very spirit of script without gaining \\*anything\\* for it.  \nHowever, I like the colours and the idea with the sails is charming. With a more lively, sympathetic typeface, a bit more elegance, perhaps a more calligraphic approach you may end up at a really sparkling solution.  \nGood luck!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks the for comments Andreas. Yes, Avant Garde is everywhere and I shouldn't have used it but it suited the sail idea quite well. Anyway, the client has deemed this solution too modern. So it was back to the drawing board.\n\nI have now proposed a more retro and continental look with subtle nautical references. The restaurant will offer Italian style food, coffee, etc.\n\nThe interior designer is proposing a classic American style, with a minimal slightly Shaker feel. No clutter, a nice clean look.\n\nA earlier comment in this thread stated the accent was missing from the 'E' in Café. This inspired me to make it boat shaped.\n\nThe 'E' acts as pier found at marinas. Abstract I know, but most folks should see the boat shape at least. Maybe it's too big, I need to play around with it.\n\nIf the client likes the approach I will tweak it and explore more colourways, and perhaps typefaces. The figure of 8 knot in the divider line needs more work also.\n\nYou can view the concepts here:  \n [http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeR...](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201051243/http:/i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva02a.jpg \"http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva02a.jpg\")\n\n[http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeR...](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201051243/http:/i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva02b.jpg \"http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e112/smitchell7/Graphic%20Design/CafeRiva02b.jpg\")\n\nI look forward to reading your responses.

I think of a cafe to be inviting, somewhere you want to have a cup of coffee.\n\nYou've mentioned that your client rejected the first idea, because it was too modern. Although, maybe you should revisit that idea. Ask yourself what would that logo look like if it took on a different personality. Use that logo as a starting point and move away from it, change the colors, thin out the line, strip away the pieces, take them apart, and then reassemble them. Think of those elements as your palette.\n\nRegarding color, blue isn't a color closely associated with food and drink. It does not inspire people to eat. Research has shown that blue decreases one's appetite.\n\nI also agree with \"aluminum\" —using the logotype on the bathroom doors is diluting the strength of the identity. You wouldn't want to brand bathroom doors with the same emphasis as the logo that's representing food product.\n\n"

If you want to break away from it, you could use other image, as a symbol, metaphor, etc that represents the business. Look at Starbuck for example.\n\n"
