BQ, BE, Next?  \nAnd what is with AG Old face - is that Akzidenz Grotesk too, in info it says:  \nThis design emphasizes the 19th Century hand-setting roots of the original Akzidenz-Grotesk.\n\nIn the end what version is the best? I sure like BE because of that lowercase a in medium weight, especially because of how Muller Brockmann used it. Others?\n\nThanks.\n\n",

      "content": "The metal face Berthold published varied hugely from size to size.  \nFor instance, if you look at the early 1950s specimen book, you'll see that some sizes have angled endings to the terminals on S while others have a flat ending, as the clone Helvetica would. Subsequently, AG has become associated with the angled terminal on that letter and c and e, diverging from Helvetica.\n\nTransferring to phototype, most notably with the Diatronic (what a great name) system, these size differences were standardized, because one master design was used for all sizes. So the redesigners had to choose which size to use as the model, or which combination of features from different sizes, to work best across a range of sizes. Of course, there were differing interpretations.\n\nI don't think any particular version is best. It depends on what you use it for, and why you like it. If one version gives you the Brockmann vibe, and that's something you can relate to, that's cool.\n\nI used to like AG, Helvetica, Univers and Folio etc., 25 years ago, but have \"been there done that\" and am now more interested in newer ideas of what a sans serif can be, and also older ones!--like how the genre originated way back in the 19th century.\n\n"

      "content": "More than a hundred years ago Berthold (a typecaster that had acquired quite a few other firms) consolidated several cuts of typefaces (from multiple sources) in the then extremely hip and desirable style of sans serif under the brand 'Akzidenz Grotesk'.  \nThese fonts had no other relationship than a common style. But they were all the rage. Smart marketing.  \n(In a way it is one of these cases where a common name turns into a brand. Akzidenz Grotesk is a very descriptive name, roughly translates to 'Jobbing sans type'.)\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"
