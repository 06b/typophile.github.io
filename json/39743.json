After  \nsix months of intensive work planning the project and finding temporary  \nhomes for thousands of books and artifacts, the space was cleared for  \ncontractors to move in and refurbish it in mid-October. They installed a  \npartition between the new reading room and the machinery room, replaced  \nservices, and redecorated a room which has gone without improvement for  \nover thirty years. Shelving, including a nine-bay set of rolling shelves  \ngiving us 508 metres of storage, was installed last week. The shelves  \nwere filled by a band of volunteers and staff on 18 and 19 November and  \nall is now ready.\n\nThe new Reading Room is distinctly different from its predecessor. For  \nthe first time, about ten thousand books are within easy reach, either  \non open shelving or on stacks which are near at hand. The shelving is  \nopen, so it will be easier for visitors to use. We hope to be able to  \nwelcome many more new people in future, making them into regular  \nvisitors who appreciate the qualities of the material we hold and are  \neager to make use of it.\n\nWe’d like to thank the many people who have put time and effort into  \nthis project. Firstly, to the project staff and contractors who worked  \nhard to meet our tight deadline. We’re delighted with the new  \nfacilities. Secondly, to a band of volunteers who have given up so much  \nof their time to fetch and carry everything from iron handpresses to  \nboxes of trade cards, books to wood blocks around the building. Without  \ntheir help the new Reading Room would not be a reality.\n\nFor any further information or to donate to St Bride Library please contact:\n\n\\* Mike Jenkins, Chief Executive – MikeJenkins [at] stbridefoundation.org  \n\\* Nigel Roche, Librarian – NigelRoche [at] stbridefoundation.org  \n\\* Kanak Chhatralia, Fundraising Officer –  \nKanakChhatralia [at] stbridefoundation.org / 0207 353 3331\n\n",
