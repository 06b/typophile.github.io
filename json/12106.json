P22 is renowned for its work with museums and foundations to ensure the development of accurate historical typefaces that are fully relevant for today's computer user.\n\nIn addition to its in-house font design, P22 now licenses several new type designs from around the world with [International House of Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/typophile.com/wiki/IHOF). P22 grew further with the addition of the [Sherwood Type Collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Sherwood%20Type%20Collection). In late 2004, P22 aquired [Lanston Type Co.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lanston%20Type%20Co.) And in early 2006 P22 launched the [Rimmer Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Rimmer%20Type%20Foundry).\n\nP22 has been involved in a number of other projects including publishing the [Indie Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Indie%20Fonts) series of books through its [P-Type Publications](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/typophile.com/wiki/P-Type%20Publications) division. Finally, we're sure you agree that no type foundry is complete without its own record label, Atom Smash Records.\n\nWebsites:  \n [P22 type foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/www.p22.com/)  \n [International House of Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/)  \n [Sherwood Type Collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/www.p22.com/sherwoodtype/fonts.html)  \n [Lanston Type Company](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/)  \n [Rimmer Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/www.p22.com/rtf/)  \n [P-Type Publications](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/www.p22.com/indiefonts/)  \n [Atom Smash Records](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001237/http:/www.p22.com/records/)\n\n",
