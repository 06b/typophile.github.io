  "content": "Hi!  \nI am freshman and just start to use Fontlab (XP platform).  \nI try to test my first opentype font so I only add a ligature feature to my font in the FontLab 5.  \nAll things go well until I try to generate my new font.  \nI have tested the ligature in Opentype preview wnd. It's perfect.  \nBut I don't add the digital signature to my font so my font icon is not correct.  \nI wanna know:  \nIn this condition, can my ligature work in InDesign or WinWord ?  \nI tried to make it run, but failed. Later I also tried the MS Volt and my ligature runs well in it but after I ship font, it can't work in InDesign.  \nWithout the DISG, can Opentype feature still work well?\n\nWaiting for your reply and Thank you very much!!!\n\nRegards,  \nKT\n\n",

I can only check it in InDesign? Is there some text editor support ligature and other opentype features ?\n\nThanks a lot! :)\n\nKT\n\n"

      "content": "Digital signature (DSIG) need only for inform user about **originality of the font**. Ligatures controlled and used only by OT feature liga. Microsoft Word/Notepad/Wordpad, Emurasoft EmEditor and others except Adobe Creative Suite can't have access to ligatures. Also right way is placing ligatures to a private area (assign proper Unicode index for glyph) to get access to your ligature in OT-blind applications.\n\nI'm right ? Correct me if not.\n\n"
