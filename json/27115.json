(If you have ever used a Garamond revival, or a Didot or a Fournier, you are indebted to the Imprimerie.) Their collection, which spans four centuries, is scheduled to be dissolved in the next twelve months.   \n   \nThe petition, in seventeen languages, is here:   \n   \n [http://www.garamonpatrimoine.org/petition.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140309064850/http:/www.garamonpatrimoine.org/petition.html)   \n   \nI know that the inclusion of YOUR name will inspire others to sign as well. Please step up!   \n   \nPlease forgive the wide distribution of this e-mail, but do forward it in its entirety to anyone who you think will join us.   \n   \n   \nThank you,   \n   \n   \nJonathan Hoefler\n\n",
