  "content": "Hi there,\n\nA while ago I created [Compyx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234145/http:/pixelambacht.nl/2014/compyx-a-multicolor-8bit-font/), a multicolor font (using Abdobe/Mozilla's SVG-in-OpenType technique). It'll show up like your average singlecolor font in browser that don't support this yet, but it'll show up in classic green/gray colors in Firefox, and soon Chrome.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234145im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bpj6a02CMAAC85k_4593.png)\n\nYou can download the TTF/WOFF [in the blog post](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234145/http:/pixelambacht.nl/2014/compyx-a-multicolor-8bit-font/).\n\nI was wondering if you know a good place to upload this font so it can be used by more people. It's pretty much open source/public domain.\n\n",
