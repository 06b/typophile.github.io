  "content": "My father Karl Pausch, who died in 1984, created a typface called Kap Antiqua for VCG in the seventies. I remember the time when worked on it and he left me a copy of some of his originals.  \nDoes someone know something about this typeface: Examples where it was used? Is it still in use? Are there still documents or originals about this typface at VGC?\n\nMany thanks in advance for every hint!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nDr. Rolf Pausch  \nMedienwissenschaftler\n\nE-Mail:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202001035im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KP-Archiv15_5072.jpg)\n\n",
