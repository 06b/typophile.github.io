Weathered capitals feature artistry to touch off waves of mystique and experience. Almond Script is rusty and textured calligraphy as only Angel Koziupa and Alejandro Paul can make it. Scarred and wavy like an exhausted warrior, slim and delicate like a tango dancer, this typeface is a unique convergence of the rough ancient brush and the modern Latin elegance.\n\nNine out of ten packaging design experts agree: Almond Script has nothing to do with whitening your teeth, but it certainly can brand your product like no other script can. A feature-rich OpenType version is also available.\n\n**[Cafelatte](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418204939/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000214)**\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418204939im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cafe_5837.jpg)\n\nIt’s not everyday that you would want to have dark chocolate with your favorite latté. But sometimes, as out of the ordinary as it is, it can be just the ticket. Cafelatte’s design offers a somewhat unpolished calligraphic concept, reminiscent of wooden type, but finessed with the unique brush of Angel Koziupa and the Bezier wizardry of Alejandro Paul. The discerning packaging designer will certainly find it refreshing to be able to put a darker, unconventional touch on his or her design. And who says primal instincts can’t be expressed elegantly? A feature-rich OpenType version is also available.\n\n**[Aguafina Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418204939/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000248)**\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418204939im_/http:/typophile.com/files/agua_3497.jpg)\n\nSemi-formal and eye-catching elegance is the name of the game, says Aguafina Script, Koziupa and Paul’s latest creation. Graceful, but not too casual. Knowledgeable and artistic, but not too imposing. The characters flow into each other, making a very saucy script with appetizing color. The narrow lowercase allows for efficient use of space, while the long ascenders and descenders help maintain the legibility. A very unique find among scripts, Aguafina is useful for product packaging, glossy magazine work, and book covers. A feature-rich OpenType version is also available.\n\n",
