I'd like the font to be, easy to read, energetic, and to have a smidgeon of quirkiness. I don't mind paying, for the right font, as long as the price isn't too excessive.\n\nThanks  \nDon\n\n",

I really appreciate it  \n Jackie, Shatter is a bit too energetic for my liking.  \n Stephen, Wubble doesn't, IMHO, have enough energy.  \n Spire, your suggestions are pretty spot on. Comicraft has a lot of suitable fonts and I really like Zoinks, and, at this stage, is probably the one I'm going to purchase.  \n However before I do, can anyone suggest any other font sites similar to comicraft. Who knows the perfect font could be just one click away....\n\nThanks once again  \nDon\n\n"
