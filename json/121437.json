These two typefaces get most of it right, save for the squared-off |B| and |R|, and the fully flat-topped |A|:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/abril-titling/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/abril-titling/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/abril-titling/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/trivia-serif-10/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/trivia-serif-10/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/trivia-serif-10/\")\n\nI found a similar |B| in a typeface that used to be offered by Linotype, Myfonts, and Fontshop, but now I can only find dubious sources for it:  \n [http://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Napoleon-Light-Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/fontsgeek.com/fonts/Napoleon-Light-Bold \"http://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Napoleon-Light-Bold\")\n\nIbis, by Font Bureau, might be helpful for the |B| and |A| as well:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/ibis-display/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/ibis-display/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/ibis-display/\")\n\nThorowgood also gets the flat-topped |A|, slab serifs, and the curly-footed |R| right, and would only require some artificial widening and some squaring off of the |B| and |R|:  \n [http://www.fonts.com/font/wooden-type-foundry/thorowgood/regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.fonts.com/font/wooden-type-foundry/thorowgood/regular \"http://www.fonts.com/font/wooden-type-foundry/thorowgood/regular\")\n\nThese might work for Restaurant:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/search/Alcalde/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Alcalde/fonts/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/search/Alcalde/fonts/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/westside/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/westside/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/westside/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/french-clarendon-n2/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/french-clarendon-n2/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/french-clarendon-n2/\")\n\nAhrens is most definitely hand-lettered, but these script faces capture the same general feel:  \n [http://www.chank.net/freefont\\_detail.php?sku=1080](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.chank.net/freefont_detail.php?sku=1080 \"http://www.chank.net/freefont\\_detail.php?sku=1080\")  \n [http://artandsignstudio.com/signwriter.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/artandsignstudio.com/signwriter.html \"http://artandsignstudio.com/signwriter.html\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/search/az+cupcakes/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/az+cupcakes/fonts/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/search/az+cupcakes/fonts/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/no.-seven/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/no.-seven/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/no.-seven/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/wonder-brush/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/wonder-brush/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/wonder-brush/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/praise/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025058/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/praise/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/praise/\") [Swash]\n\n"
