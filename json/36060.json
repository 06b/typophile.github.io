I think they all knew I had practically been giving my work away.\n\nMaybe you just need to do it and get it over with.\n\nYou'll like the feeling you get when you make the jump to where you ought to be. Less self-loathing and more focus on quality work.\n\n"

They call, we talk about a project, I give them a price, and either they accept that price, or I never hear from them again. No negotiations. It's making doing business a real bore.\n\n"
