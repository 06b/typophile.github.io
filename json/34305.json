At least use a richer/darker green something closer to a tyipcal Forest Green for the “Green Fields” type.\n\nI do like the hill and tree illustration, but the sun and clouds looks too childish and unrealistic. I’m not sure the sun actually has straight lines shooting out of it. I’m visualizing something with a lot more color (yellows\\>oranges\\>reds) and maybe even a gradient or two.\n\nAnd the lower case co. next to the all caps ARTS doesn’t seem right. either use all caps or all lower case.\n\n"

For instance using a darker, richer green for the type and filling the white area possibly with the more yellow green you are using for the time now.\n\nI also agree about the “ARTS co.” area. It feels a bit like an after thought in how the type was handled (not to mean offense, just that it seems very much as if it were the last bit you added). I think all lower case may help.\n\nOverall I think it is worlds better than the original (which for some reason seems NASCAR-esque to me (slanted type and color bars probably)\n\n... \\_.\\_. ... .. ... \\_\\_.. ...\\_ ...\n\n"

My friend is selling mostly glass art. Glass art being...mostly pipes and bongs and that sort of thing. Not art supplies for kids. SO I will be completely reworking his logo again. Again retaining the sun thing he has going on and wants to keep. But making it a lot more crunchy granola (this is Austin after all) and less like a scene in a children’s book.\n\n"

The intent of the site is unclear to me. Is it a site for online artist portfolios? The domain name contributes to the confusion, and the lack of a descriptive tagline perpetuates it.\n\nThe current logo looks like a lawncare business and it doesn’t scale well. The thin lines would drop out if it were scaled down to fit on a business card. It also looks very dated. The initial “improvements” you posted suffer from the same 1970s look, as well as the inability to scale. Adding more colors created a new problem: lack of contrast.\n\nThe next round of revisions is a lot more fun to look at, but the logo still doesn’t give an indication of what the site is about. “Arts” doesn’t seem descriptive enough to me. If it were me, I would give up trying to include the hills and the sun, and concentrate on using the logo to convey the purpose of the site. With that in mind, I would first scrap the domain name and replace it with something that says art instead of agriculture.\n\n"

Hence the reference to “Green.” Fields is his last name. Pay no attention to its online presence, that will be replaced to reflect the merch in his store which is mostly glass pipes. He’s going to sell his own artwork in the store as well. I tried to talk him out of the name (mostly because it doesn’t roll off the tongue) but it’s not something he’s wiling to consider.\n\nHe also doesn’t want to lose the sun. I may do some more treatments with a different version.\n\n"
