Eric Gill worked closely with Johnston on the Railway Type project and the later Gill Sans bears more than a passing resemblance to Johnston. Without grabbing Gill's biography I have a recollection that he worked so closely with Johnston that he drew a lot of the Railway Type designs for him. I could be wrong on that though. There are obvious differences, but in spirit it's frequently very close. Well, bar the diamond i and j dots and Gill Sans' interchangable 1I and l.\n\n"

But, IIRC from my own research on Perpetua, Eric only attended 3 meetings in the beginning of the development.\n\nI think Johnston is much more Geometric and adheres too much to the circle for my taste.\n\n"
