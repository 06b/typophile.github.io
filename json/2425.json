Although they are likely lined up geometrically, it looks like productions is too far left.   \n   \nIn its present form with the current alignments, I don't read it as \"a dupuis\"--the \"a\" looks like a seperate symbol, that stands for the alphabet, not necessarily a character in the name.\n\n"

      "content": "The way you have \"dupius\" and \"productions\" the same horizontal width looks strange in this font. as the curve is so extreme on the \"d\", the vertical line of the \"p\" seems to make it look as though it is farther to the left than the \"d\". The change in font listed by Daniel might help this, or you could shrink and maybe right justify the word productions. As well, this would allow for the speech bubble to be in reference of the word dupius, and if you make the \"a\" the same size as dupius, you should get better readability through the whole name. Here, this is easier than trying to explain in words:   \n   \n ![Dupius2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019080835im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/22493.jpg)\n\n"
