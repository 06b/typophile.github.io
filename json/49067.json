      "content": "The only duplicated letter in the logo is the ’a’, and it seems to be identical, so that makes it look like it’s probably a font. More letters would be more conclusive, but it has an amateurish look about it. Casual lettering like this could practically be done by anyone, and is so cheap and easy to have made into a font, that it could well be a custom font that we’ll never find. The spurs on the ’q’ and ’J’ are what keeps this from being ordinary hand-printing.\n\nMy biggest problem in looking for this is deciding what category to search for it under. I looked at several categories of hand lettering at Dafont with no luck. I was guessing it wasn’t a commercial font, but I just don’t know.\n\nMaybe someone else has an idea?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
