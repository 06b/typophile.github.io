  "content": "Hi All,\n\nThis is my debut post on typophile, and I'd like to post a question about Gentium, the free font I suppose most of you know about.\n\nTrying out this font, I thought it looked strikingly crappy in Word, compared to when you print it (the same page from Word). This difference may be common, but it seems greater for Gentium. I think it's beautiful on paper, but it's just horrible and not very legible in Word.\n\nSo I wonder, how come? What is it about Gentium that causes this?\n\nThe difference I'm talking about is for example smaller for Verdana or Calibri, typefaces designed to be legible on screen as well as on paper.\n\nJurriaan\n\n",

I think if in the future we have screens with smaller dot pitches of over 300 dpi, screen type will get more legible (the contrast for example is already good enough I think).

The fonts were probably autohinted. An autohinter can be tuned to give decent results in more predictable situations, like most traditional upright designs, but when the same algorithms are applied to the italic designs, they often make incorrect decisions, and the results look worse than unhinted at display sizes. The issue is that the autohinter is applying hints in either the horizontal or vertical direction within the character, so it doesn't know what to do when it finds an oblique stem. In the lower case \"a\",. it obviously made a very poor \"choice\"  \nHuman hinters can apply diagonal hint instructions to alleviate those problems, but obviously this is a time consuming process.\n\n"
