The utensils seem to centered in a composition determined to be assymetrical. What if you rotate the utensils about 5 degrees counterclockwise and have them \"rising\" out of the space just above the last as combo? And I might perhaps thin the thickest bits up just a bit to more closely match the thick/thin variation in the letters. But, all that said (not much I think) this is very nice.\n\n"
