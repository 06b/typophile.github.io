  "content": "I want to know what people think about contextual variants, as seen in arabic, in latin scripts. I am trying to design a typeface that consists of different letterforms according to their context. In otherwords, an a would look different depending if it was interacting with an a straight edge letterform, a curved letterform etc... My hypothesis is that if we can eliminate some of the unnecessary positive and negative space between letters, we can facilitate a more comfortable reading experience. I was wondering if people had any insight? resources that I might consider looking into? Or any examples where this has already been done.\n\nthanks!\n\n",

      "content": "My thought is that it would not make for a smooth reading experience because people haven't been trained to read that way so it would take quite a bit of exposure -- and retraining -- to get them used to it. That shouldn't be taken to mean I think it would not work or that it shouldn't be done.\n\nA good way to find out would be to actually make such a font or a small family, then perhaps have a study done by researchers or scientists to validate the merits of such an approach.\n\n"

      "content": "Many fonts have contextual alternates, mostly to avoid unsightly collisions. A recent success is Ernestine, which makes pairs like rv, rw, ry look better by trimming the left serif of the latter glyph so that the bodies can be moved closer together. But you need to keep in mind that the different spaces between letters can be a big part of what facilitates reading. Quickly differentiating letter shapes is important to reading, and just like ascenders and descenders help the reader recognize word shapes, so do things like the space in the lower right of the r.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>an a would look different depending if it was interacting with an a straight edge letterform</cite>\n\nBut an a is read, because it looks like an a. How would different a shapes be an improvement? Connected scripts have different letter shapes to facilitate the connections itself, not to improve the legibility of the single letter (I think). I am not convinced that structurally different shapes as contextual alternatives or forced ligatures (people have tried this before) can be an improvement for Latin.  \nAt least this is how I understand your approach. Small corrections for certain letter combinations are already getting more and more common in modern OpenType fonts.\n\nBut maybe you can create some sketches of that approach first? Would probably be easier to talk about it, if we can actually see and read it ourselves.\n\n"

      "content": "This is an idea I have played around with, aiming to regularise the shape of smaller white areas between terminals and adjacent shapes. I sometimes find the angularity of triangular shapes that occur when oblique terminals are adjacent to vertical stems, or vertical terminals are adjacent to curves, visually distracting. I've no idea whether his has any impact on readability, and am not claiming this design approach as aiding reading. I just wanted to explore the potential for producing a more even pattern of white space between the letters. Obviously, this approach is primarily relevent for sans serif types, and perhaps more so for display settings than for text (where the particular white space areas may be too small to have significant impact).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012030029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cochin_3732.png)\n\n"

But to simply design a typeface in which this feature is present, and where it turns out to be unobtrusive, and at least not impair readability, is a first step that should not be dismissed as worthless.\n\nThe example shown of changing the shape of the letter \"c\" shows that the benefit to be expected from this is the same as that from good kerning - a more even color of the text.\n\nPeople have lived with typographical methods that permitted essentially no kerning, from which we can conclude the effect of good kerning is subtle. Sometimes, _doing it right_ is its own reward, and designing types as they should be designed won't have enough of an impact to bring one fame and fortune - or even significant recognition from one's peers.\n\n"
