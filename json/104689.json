She had brought her children, and her 9-10 year old son was particularly obstreperous. She would tell him to stop his yelling, going to other tables & bothering people, etc., but it was just the one sentence & then back to chatting with her friends. The pattern happened over & over, and the boy kept right on making trouble.\n\nAs we finally finished our meal and left, I told the mother that she'd just given her son a lesson, that when he became a teenager, raging hormones & all, he could ignore a woman telling him \"no.\"\n\n"
