A post-modernist approach might be to argue that the world is (as hhp says) too fuzzy to fit into the modernist perspective.   \nOne of the problems with post-modernism is its natural position hiding behind the coat-tails of the king's new clothes. I'm sure it would be possible to say worthwhile things from a post-modern perspective, but too often its a cover for lazy thinking, which is immune to criticism because any complaints are obviously from a rationalist, modernist angle, which is just incapable of understanding the post-modern view.\n\n"

Or even hooliganism.   \n   \nPoMo will mature only when it starts trying to understand the boundaries between the knowable and the unknowable. The problem with Modernism is that it's as mature as it can get (as a philosophy, although inherently never in application), but in terms of humanity it's only half the picture. Obviously, I'm a post-modernist! :-) Modernism is for kids.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

That's why it didn't really catch on - it refused to grow up, through critical introspection and objective analysis. A new movement can start chaotically, but can only sustain itself through discipline.   \n   \nThe good news is that there's a new Emigre now, and looking at some recent font releases, maybe, just maybe they're on the golden PoMo track now (although all I for one really see so far is faint signals). If that's the case, it sure would be nice for them to admit -and analyze- their confused past. What's scary of course is that intelligent PoMo wouldn't sell very well at the moment. Well, intelligent _anything_, really...   \n   \n\\> humanity is key   \n   \nOne thing I would elaborate on that though is this: humanity isn't just formal humanism. The heart of any merit PoMo has (or could have) is the acceptance that humans are only half conscious. A serious, selfless perspective on communication is severely limited by restricting \"humanity\" to chirography, base animal emotions, or anything else: as much as possible needs to be considered, although necessarily imperfectly. And that's where Modernism implodes: it suffers from the classic Western chimera of Total Control. Give it up, people - it'll never work.   \n   \n\\> Bringhurst   \n   \nLike most any other scheme, I find his classification useful, but imperfect. Two places it fails:   \n1) It treats type design as an Art, and that's less than half the picture.   \n2) Being based on existing culture, it cannot really cover anything _new_.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
