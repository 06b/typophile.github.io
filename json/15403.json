  "content": "Hello typophilers,\n\nit’s been a long time since my last post  \nand i missed being around the block.\n\nSo, here I come up with a series of posters  \nI did for a small exhibition of unpublished  \nworks of mine created during the last  \n5 years.If your way happento cross  \nThessaloniki you could contact with me  \nto visit the exhibition. It will be open  \nuntill midof November (maybe it will  \nlast even more).\n\nAbout the posters, I used two layers:  \na constant one with the information  \nin handmade lettering  \nand the background layer  \nwhich is changing, taking different  \nphotos I shot around the city or  \nin friends’ houses.\n\nThe posters are not trying to describe  \nthe exhibition. They are a theme  \nby themselves, though, inevitably  \nthey give a hint of my graphic style,  \nwhich is what you are going to watch  \nin the exhibition.\n\nBy the posters I wanted to address  \nto people who live in the same (urban)  \nenvironment as me. The photos present  \nthis environment, which at this point  \nis filtered by my eyes. So, actually  \nI state my existence in this place  \nwe share.\n\nchristos\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TSOLER\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/files/TSOLER_1.jpg) | 67.31 KB |\n| [TSOLER\\_2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/files/TSOLER_2.jpg) | 69.26 KB |\n| [TSOLER\\_3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/files/TSOLER_3.jpg) | 95.19 KB |\n| [TSOLER\\_4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/files/TSOLER_4.jpg) | 72.43 KB |\n| [TSOLER\\_5.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/files/TSOLER_5.jpg) | 81.31 KB |\n| [TSOLER\\_6.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/files/TSOLER_6.jpg) | 78.45 KB |\n| [TSOLER\\_7.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/files/TSOLER_7.jpg) | 81.01 KB |\n\n [‹ Typographic Painting](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/node/15101 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Elizabeth Horne Gift Voucher ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042350/http:/typophile.com/node/15420 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

My favourites are  \nKarv Sans, Slabb and Eliza (with its “Dorothy” variation),  \nbut I really miss a PDF with all characters.  \nDo you plan to upload one in the future?\n\nCongratulations and please tell me what “kia ora” means?  \nIs it a maory phrase?\n\n―christos\n\n"
