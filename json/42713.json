  "content": "Does anyone know of a font which contains the London underground roundel as a character? I am working on a book which requires the icon in each of something around 1000 entries. I've found P22 Johnston underground extras, but the only roundel it contains is one in which the bar doesn't run through the centre of the circle, and which is also too heavy for my purposes.  \nAny suggestions gratefully received.\n\n",
