      "content": "It’s too generic. It could be for a design firm anywhere in the world.\n\nAlso, the ratio between the icon and the logotype is out of proportion. The icon is way too large.\n\nI don’t think the color treatment will translate into black & white. Remember, a logo needs to work in all forms of media, including newsprint and fax.\n\nWork on some more concepts and also provide a little more background information on what you want to achieve. That will help us give better crits.\n\n"

      "content": "Sebastien, I agree that the proportion is out of balance. If you plan to use the ’W’ symbol as a scalable entity anyway, why not put it into a proper size relationship with the type for the logo? It can always be enlarged or shrunk when used in a pattern.\n\nI _do_ like the ’W’ for its simplicity, and think it could translate into the pattern element you desire. But it is very dependant on its color right now to distinguish the four strokes, as David mentioned above. (It’s a nice color palette, though!) I also prefer the side-ways version... it offers a bit of abstraction to something otherwise very straightforward.\n\n"

I understand the flatness & like it but a logo meant to be for business people should maybe be warmer if feeling. I didn’t want to completly change the idea so Ithought of a varient... I like the colors too. But the flatness seems a little to static & unmoving to me.\n\n"

Why is that? what is the problem with “business people in Belgium”?\n\n2. How would you describe “Wallonie Design” to someone who has no knowledge of its existence? 10-15 words.\n\n3. What will “Wallonie Design” likley be in 5 years? 10 years?\n\n4. Try to explore not just symbol-name combination; try: (a) name only logo. (b) monogram/acronyms.  \nThen pick the best.\n\n"

It is a competition and I don’t really know a lot about Wallonie Design. What I got from the “brief” is that they want to bring design to manufacturers and service providers in the south of Belgium (Wallonie). Could be by means of conference, helping businesses commissioning work, etc.\n\nThanks again, your input is genuinely helping me.\n\n"
