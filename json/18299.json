In V2, these demands are  \nsatisfied with Mike Hebrew web which may be used for reading email and looking at Isreali web pages. It is more square than the Mike Hebrew family and so my be used  \nat a smaller size. Adding Mike Hebrew Web has enabled me to avoid compromises with the  \nother members of the family.\n\nI would be particularly interest in views from Israelis on the use of Mike Hebrew Web.\n\n",

I have now increased the gap in the Heh.\n\nI imagine the font would be used for decorative effect in small doses.\n\nHowever, I have the Mike Hebrew Web as my default font in a browser  \nand in response to this experience I am going to add  \nMike Hebrew Web Bold in the next release. The online newspapers  \nHaAretz and Ynet require a bold.\n\nMike  \n [http://www.cunliffethompson.com/font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414154751/http:/www.cunliffethompson.com/font \"http://www.cunliffethompson.com/font\")\n\n"
