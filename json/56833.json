  "content": "I was working late when I heard a near riot breakout in the alley. I got there in time to see Futura and News Gothic pulling their furious friend away. Avenir and Century Gothic were a few feet away helping their beaten friend to his feet. I think it started over the amorous intentions of a young designer. Another day and time the outcome may have been different because they are both stunningly strong fighters, but it was obvious that there was bad blood and that Trade Gothic had just kicked Gotham’s ass.\n\n",
