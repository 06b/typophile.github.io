  "content": "Attached are three pdfs. Each is a sample cluster of words for three monoline variations on Gill Sans. These are inspired by Gill's serif faces but not meant to be sans versions of his serif faces. Instead, they're meant to be subtle variations on the classic Gill Sans – each with a bit different personality. One is a bit insular, staccato, plain. Two has more open counters and curves, and is hopefully more lyrical. Three is more robust, swaggering.\n\nPlease feel free to weigh in with your opinions. Enjoy!
