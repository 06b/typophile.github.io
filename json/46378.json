  "content": "So, I had particularly annoying day with client revisions and a coworker and I got into a discussion about how much input clients have at larger agencies. I work at a small firm ( \\< 10 people), in a small market, and the philosophy is: no matter what the client wants, give it to them.\n\nIs this the same at larger agencies? I recognize that no matter where you work the people that fit the bill will always have last say, but what about when they’re running with scissors? What if they say I want my logo fonts changed to Lucida Calligraphy and Comic Sans???? \\<—Reason for this post.\n\n [‹ New Fell Types and new iKern site.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907013309/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46301 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Calgary: June meeting ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907013309/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46517 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Justify your typefaces and why theirs are wrong for the brand for whatever reason. If you let them run all over you, they won’t respect you and you’ll be stuck doing production work instead of designing.\n\n"

I think the skill set in some organizations can manage the client, and in many ways you have to, since ultimately, we won’t produce anything unless the client signs off first.\n\nIf your creative and marketing presentations on a campaign contain “researched detail” on the effectiveness of your proposed imagery, copy, graphics, type choices upon the target audience, you just might get away from facing the clients “personal preferences” for color or photos, etc.\n\nI have had comments from very big clients on very large interactive projects asking us to change the shape of a “button” on the global navigation. “Yes sir, we will look into that with our Information Architect and Creative Director. But you see, sir, they specifically selected this particular shape since the click-through rate just happens to be 12% higher than your suggested shape, sir.”\n\nBusiness is business, and art isn’t.\n\n"

Once it looks easy, the client wants to play too.\n\nHopefully, we can all get to the point where we get to be a little more picky about our clientèle.

Your job as the design firm, is to make sure the client picks the best solution. If the client ends up dictating the project where the solution is compromised, it’s less the client’s fault and more the firm’s fault for not selling them the right solution.\n\nA big part of good design is SELLING good design. ;o)\n\n"
