School in a local kind of cultural radio station.   \n   \nWe are looking for some topics and ideas for the program (we have a first chance to try and will continue depending on the quality and success) so I wondered if anyone has a sugestion.   \n   \nOur main problem as G.D. in the community is that our work is not valued, it is perciebed as an artistic ornament for products.   \n   \nThanks\n\n",
