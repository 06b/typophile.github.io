My opinion is that this work is not a font, but that these stamps are made from a hand-drawn original. I think this is at least very similar to the script fonts sold by Emily Lime foundry, which are drawn by Emily Connors.\n\nYou can find her work at MyFonts.com. Carolyna is one that shows many similarities, I think.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Not reading, Mike...\n\nLooking at the Emily Lime fonts, like [Emmy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120011/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/emily-lime/emmy/?refby=bowfin), I see similar numbers and letterforms, just made more casually. If this is her work, which is my current theory, this sans serif font is a more polished version she uses for the stamp line.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
