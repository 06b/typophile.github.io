  "content": "Recently (March 5) I gave a talk with the above title at the École de design of the Université du Québec à Montréal in their series _Enjeux actuels en Design_. (The original theme for the series was \"interactive practices in design.\") This was at the invitation of Alessandro Colizzi, who teaches there.\n\nMy talks are usually tightly 'scripted,' and against a backdrop of pdf-style 'slides.'\n\nIn case some of you are interested in reviewing or commenting on what I had to say, here is my text and the slides:  \n [text](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619231806/http:/www.enneson.com/UQAM/uqam_ge+eitvc+design_script.pdf)  \n [slides](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619231806/http:/www.enneson.com/UQAM/uqam_ge+eitvc+design_slides.pdf)\n\nThe pdf of the slides will open up as a full screen set of visuals, so you'll have to advance slides by using the side to side arrows on your keyboard. Press: 'escape' on your keyboard to see it in the normal pdf environmnet.\n\n",

      "content": "Peter, I find the Fourier transform pictures of text intriguing, but frustrating as I don't know how to 'read' them properly. I know that a Fourier transform decomposes a function into its separate harmonic components, but I don't know how to relate that to the pictures of text blocks.\n\nDo you know of any tutorial on line which explains how to read such pictures?\n\n"

The web site is where I drew my inspiration from, after a post by Raph a year or so ago. The paper is in a way complementary, but makes a different point.\n\nNick, I'm not sure this is the presentation I'd want to give in my home town.\n\n"
