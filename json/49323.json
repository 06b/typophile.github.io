I purchased the font, but haven't received it -- there's nowhere to download it and I've gotten no emails. I'll give it a few more hours before panicking and resorting to a different typeface, but does anyone have any advice about how purchasing fonts works on the site?\n\nThanks! Gracias!\n\n"

I pressed \"comprar\", paid paypal, and then had to re-enter the url to go back to the site (no forwarding or button to return), and no sign of download. I'm assuming I get an email with attachment, but it's been a few hours since I paid.\n\nAnyhoo, any info would help! I can always use a non-Chilean face, since no one but me will probably care.\n\nThanks!  \n-\"Aunt\" beth\n\n"
