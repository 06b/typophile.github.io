Knoll, Ikea, etc. You might find that putting a table in the logo is extremely literal, especially since the word table already exists. Consider the stucture and versitility of the table and the structure and versitility of the type.\n\n"

Some of the other logos are not very legible either, like the dot matrix thing. I would keep exploring this one.\n\n"

      "content": "Mike, you really need to check out the Knoll logo, it really says alot about their furniture by just using simple san serif typography.   \n   \nThink about the reasons people are buying office furniture. 1. They don't want it to break. 2. They want the style to last forever. 3. They want it to be comfortable. 4. They want it to be versitile. 5. They want it to be cheap.   \n   \nNow your logo should problably be able to describe at least 4 out of 5 of those topics or it will be unsuccesful. Good Luck\n\n"

I understand what you are saying about the Knoll logo David, but I know my client and he wouldd honestly laugh at me if I presented versatables in helvetica, and wanted some money for it. I think with versatables, style is out of the picture....all that really matters is function and it being a solid product. I'll keep at at and see what happens.\n\n"

      "content": "Mike:   \n   \nI don't think David meant to use Helvetica specifically and I'm not sure that you were being literal either, but a point I'd like to make regarding presentation to clients and positioning yourself with clients is this�   \n   \nPosition yourself as the expert in regard to design, then back it up. Talk the talk, walk the walk, look the look, do whatever you have to in order to give your client confidence in your abilities, then earn their respect. This is done by doing your homework (research and sketching). Follow David's advice and find some successful industry logos (Knoll, Ikea, Design Within Reach, Herman Miller, etc.), then collect attractive applications of those logos for presentation purposes. After you've sought this inspiration, combine it with the knowledge you've gained about your client's products/services, personality and objectives and put your pencil to paper. Once you've done this you are very likely to develop some significant logo concepts on the computer. Finally, between the concepts (even if they are just logotype) and the research, an even slightly level-headed client will not laugh at your concepts.   \n   \nTake it for whatever it's worth. I just hate to see a talented designer submit to his client's limitations so early in the design process. Come up with a great concept which has proven relevance.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

You have the T that could be just a leg of the table or even look for a \"cool\" table surface and yes, keep it simple is the best.   \n   \nI know it's not an easy task to \"sell\" your idea to the client, I've just had a case where the logo concept was totally subverted & destroyed. \"Put some wings\" on those letters they said.   \n   \nI've remembered Psyops ARMCHAIR font that can be a starting point (they have a flash try that I've used and print screened 2 variations), check some examples I've made.
