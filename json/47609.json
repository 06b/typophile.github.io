The thing is the client doesn’t want them on a roll, he wants them die cut on a full sheet so he can print the mailing addresses on with his home laser printer. should I just spec full sheet label paper with die cuts or do printers have access to precut stock? I don’t know these things.\n\nDoes anyone have a suggestion for a good printer or a place I can find a list of printers? they need not be local so I’m not concerned about where it is, as long as it’s in the US.\n\n [‹ Suggestions for a \"British Raj\" typeface?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122012238/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47595 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typesetting course ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122012238/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47614 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I found the best way to seek out good printers was to simply ask my tutors in college, they are probably from your area and will already have a personal relationship built up with a particular printer.\n\nWhen it comes to your printing specs just ask the printer! On my first real job I talked to a good 5 printers and each time I grilled them for information. Not just about my upcoming project but anything that came to mind. They should be more then happy to help and answer all your questions.\n\n"
