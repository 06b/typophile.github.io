The film is Russian, not Cuban, but is a landmark in cinematography and shows what Cuba looked like visually just after the revolution. About a year ago, a film came out about how I Am Cuba was made. It is a Brazillian production, shown as I understand it on the Sundance Network and at festivals, but not yet available, to my knowledge, on DVD.\n\nNestor Almendros, a Cuban cinematographer who left to work with some of the great French directors and ultimately in the US (he won an Academy Award for Days of Heaven) wrote a book called Man with a Camera, in which he talks about his years in Cuba. He also made a film about Cuba that is available on DVD.\n\nJulian Schnabel, the New York painter, made a film, after his Basquiat, called Before Night Falls. While shot in Mexico, the recreation of post-Castro Havana rings true. I should say that this film, about the persecuted writer Arenas, has been criticized by some people as right-wing/anti-Castro.\n\nFinally, a couple of years ago, the Museum of Modern Art in New York ran an exhibit called Fashion in Photography. The exhibit, for which a catalogue has been published that is readily available, includes a number of photographs made in Havana by Philip-Lorca di Corcia. One of his photographs in particular, of a woman and other patrons in a bar, is extraordinarily evocative of Havana.\n\nCheers\n\n"

It is an extremely. important film, contemporary with the period that you are studying, and you will learn a great deal from it about what Cuba, including Havana, looked like at that time. There is even a sequence about the printing of revolutionary leaflets.\n\nAnd if you aren’t familiar with it, Ry Cooder’s Buena Vista Social Club is a must.\n\nGood luck.\n\n"

Schnabel brings a painter’s eye to film, and Before Night Falls has wonderful performances by Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp.\n\nIf you like Before Night Falls, check out Schnabel’s Basquiat, with David Bowie playing Andy Wharol and a young Jeffrey Wright as Basquiat. Nothing to do with Cuba, but interesting in its own right.\n\nBefore Night Falls is a good antidote to the politics of I Am Cuba. I Am Cuba is important because of its extraordinary camera work and use of film stock, especially infrared stock.\n\nFor your purposes, I Am Cuba is also important because it was shot during the time that you need to know about, and much of it shows Cuba and Havana as they actually were.\n\nPhilip-Lorca di Corcia’s work is not confined to the MOMA exhibit. If you don’t have access to the MOMA catalogue, check out his work on the web.\n\nIf you see Buena Vista Social Club, it may interest you to know that Ibrahim Ferrer died last August, aged 78, just after a tour of Europe.\n\nIf you are interested in film,it is very interesting to watch I Am Cuba and Nestor Almendros’s Days of Heaven within a short time of one-another.\n\nCurious about your reactions to this stuff.\n\n"

      "content": "If that is the project you are working on, what you will get from I Am Cuba is an accurate depiction of the architecture, dress, etc. of the time.\n\nIf Norbert’s Havana Journal article is correct in saying that Garcia’s film gives the middle class, and especially students, a prominent role in the revolt against Batista, you will find that I Am Cuba is at least partly in tune. One of the film’s story-lines focuses on the University of Havana.\n\nGiven what the Havana Journal article says, I find it interesting that Almendros, in his autobiography, says that he returned from New York to Cuba in 1959 because he supported the revolution and that, at the time, the revolution had not declared itself communist. Indeed, he says that in 1959 Havana cinemas were showing the latest French New Wave films including The Cousins, The 400 Blows and Hiroshima Mon Amour. By 1961/2, Almendros decided that he had to leave Cuba due to the emergence of a dictatorship, censorship and concern for his own security.\n\nUnrelated to all this, and probably irrelevant to your project, there are a couple of things about I Am Cuba that are likely to jump out at you.\n\nThe first is the use of sophisticated, highly choreographed camera movements. These were achieved with very simple equipment, not complex cranes and fancy stabilizing devices like the Steadycam (a device that didn’t exist, at the time, even in Hollywood). As hard as it is to believe, it is said that some of the movements were done by having the camera passed by hand from one person to another.\n\nThe second thing that you will notice, in this black and white film, is that there are scenes in which the shades of gray are wrong. This is not due, as a young film student suggested to me recently, to poor Russian stock. It is due to the use of infrared stock, which turns light skies dark and green sugarcane leaves very light.\n\n"
