The version I licensed for a project a few years back contains 194 kern pairs! And that is consistent with a thorough analysis that Kent Lew provided in this thread: [http://typophile.com/node/459#comment-2948](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612185941/http:/typophile.com/node/459#comment-2948 \"http://typophile.com/node/459#comment-2948\").\n\nClearly, there have been updates.\n\nIt strikes me as a little odd that the earlier release had the raised “3.” I can only speculate that it was recognized as a mistake and therefore corrected in a subsequent version.\n\n"

In any case, I hope that one  \nday somebody will fix the spacing of Mrs Eaves too.\n\nI’ve actually heard a rumor that James Montalbano  \nonce did exactly that for some client (undoubtedly with  \npremission from Emigre).
