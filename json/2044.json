  "content": "Hi all,   \n   \nI've been having a problem with my ascenders and descenders brushing up against each other when lines of type are set in my new typeface. I'm using FontLab, and from what I can tell from reading the manual, my problem lies in adjusting the line gap. When I do this, regardless of the amount I put in, the baseline never changes. I'm completely stuck. Any suggestions?   \n   \nPretty please? ![Screen grab of FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102085941im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/20331.gif)\n\n",

Thanks!\n\n"
