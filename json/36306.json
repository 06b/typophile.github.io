How was this done?  \nI've tried Illustrator & Photoshop tuts found on the net with semi-acceptable  \nresults but they still looked 'traced'.  \nDoing these manually is a bit rediculous, I know.\n\nAnyone?\n\nThanks  \nJim\n\n"

It would be relatively simple to space them out on a grid then adjust their sizes to the brightness of a linked image. It is the nature of metaballs to distort their shapes as their surfaces come within proximity of another metaball, which should create the geometric inversion you're looking for.\n\nThere probably is something that does that but I can't think of it. Best I've been able to manage is to generate a super-oversize halftone in Photoshop as dimitre did above and autotrace it.\n\n"
