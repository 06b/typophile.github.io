  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm having a small problem when generating my font with Studio 5. I'm new to this program and after looking through the manual with no luck and after I did some search o the internet with no luck also I thought to give it a try and ask here.\n\nI drew my fonts in Illustrator and they look nice, smooth curves, few points and everything. I import them in Studio 5 and they look very nice also. I hit generate font, install the font in windows and when I try typing with it to use it... the curves don't look nice anymore. Something happens along the way and I just can't figure out what. If I convert the letter to outlines in Illustrator it gets a lot of points also, like 50 instead of 15 when I drew it. The letters look nice in both Illustrator and Studio 5, but they don't look so nice after I generate it as a true type/open type.\n\nI have a feeling this might be a silly question for the experienced but I'm at the beginning and I didn't know where to turn to.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n",

      "content": "Here are three instances of the endings of a letter. The first one is the clean one made in Illustrator. The second one is how it looks like after generating it as Open Type TT/True Type in Fontographer and the third one is after generating it FontLab Studio 5. Also I've tuned off autohinting in Fontographer before generating the font. Anyway, the curves are not smooth, not like the original vector drawing.\n\nThanks for taking a look. I just don't know what to do.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420170419im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sample_4543.jpg)\n\n"
