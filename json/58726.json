  "content": "Creating a new font in FontLab.... I've set up Mask and Background layers (based on an old font) in all glyph cells of the new font. Although many of the cells of my new font do not currently contain outline glyphs (for example the \"onehalf\" fraction). I would like to use the Mask and Background layers as positioning guides while drawing new outline glyphs.\n\nBut each time I use the Glyphs \\> Create Glyphs command ( for example - to quickly get my digits and slash into my \"onehalf\" fraction cell) I loose my Mask and Background layers. They are now deleted from my \"onehalf\" fraction cell, but this is precisely where I need them as a positioning guide.\n\nIt would be quite tedious to add the Mask and Background layers back in each time. Better to generate them all at once in the beginning.\n\nIs there anyway to prevent FontLab from deleting the Mask and Background when using the Create Glyphs command?\n\nGracias.\n\n",
