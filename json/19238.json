Ulrich Stiehl told me that he has already checked that neither Linotype/Monotype/FontShop nor [www.fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829165836/http:/www.fonts.com/ \"www.fonts.com\") nor [www.myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829165836/http:/www.myfonts.com/ \"www.myfonts.com\") supply this font, but perhaps a small typefoundry has digitized the font Melissa and sells it under another name.  \nI'm looking for a special occassion to the \"Melissa Inline von Letragraphica LG2320\" from 1977 designed by Douglas Sheldrake\n\nPlease look to the inserted image for the right Melissa font.  \nMaybe there are other fonts with the same name \"Melissa\", because there are also other completely different fonts also called \"Melissa\". For example, Compugraphic called its forgery of Zapf's Melior as \"Melissa\".\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829165836im_/http:/typophile.com/files/melissa.jpg)\n\nIts no problem to buy the fontset. Please let me know if somebody can help me.\n\nThanks for your concerns.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nLouis van der Veer  \nNetherlands\n\n",
