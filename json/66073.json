  "content": "Hi there,\n\nattached you can see a blackletter typeface.\n\nAs i am not very familiar with blackletter typefaces i was hoping someone might be able to 1) identify the typeface itself or 2) identify the historic origin or 3) make a suitable suggestion for an alternative or even a suggestion for any beautiful blackletter off-parameter.\n\nAs said i am not familiar with those folks myself. I know about a book called [Fraktur mon amour](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/www.fraktur-mon-amour.de/de/) which i unfortunately do not have though.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nregards, steffen\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tp\\_typeid.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/typophile.com/files/tp_typeid.jpg) | 8.03 KB |\n\n",

Other foundries had their own versions of this style, like the Manuskript Gotisch that Georg has shown above. At the beginning of the 20th century, [Morris Fuller Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Morris%20Fuller%20Benton) designed a version for ATF.\n\nMore information about the history of Old English typefaces can be found in this [Linotype Font Feature](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/www.linotype.com/2195/oldenglishfonts.html).\n\nToday, there is a number of digital ‘Old English’ fonts:  \n [Monotype’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/monotype_old_english_text_std_plain/) (and [Mecanorma’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/old-english/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D28%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DUngl%25C3%25BCcklicher%2520bayerischer%2520Kronprinz%2520%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D32)) is pretty wide and loose.  \nThe [URW version](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/old_english/?&sample_text=Ungl%C3%BCcklicher%20bayerischer%20Kronprinz&sample_size=32) is lighter, with the ‘i’ dots shifted a bit to the right. It has the long s (ſ) as default.  \n [Bitstream’s version](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/cloister_black_regular_ot/?&sample_text=Ungl%C3%BCcklicher%20bayerischer%20Kronprinz&sample_size=32) is called ‘Cloister Black’ and can be easily distinguished by its sporns on ‘b’, ‘h’, ‘k’.\n\nFurthermore, there are numerous ‘spin-offs’, e.g. [Avebury Black](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/www.typedesign.com/fonts/aveblk.html), an ultra-black and wide display version by [Jim Parkinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014144316/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jim%20Parkinson).  \nF\n\n"
