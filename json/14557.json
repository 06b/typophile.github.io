  "content": "i’m looking for a postcript laser printer to use with my powerbook for printing proofs of my college work, and other projects. i don’t really know where to start though! had a browse of a mac specialist site i’ve used for other purchases, but there were at least 50 different models to choose between.\n\nwe do have printers at college, but only 4, and they’re shared between the entire graphics department (a good few hundred, there’s 55 in my pathway alone). plus it’s not open during the holidays, which doesn’t help. so rather than queue for an hour or so i think it’s time to take the plunge and fork out the money.\n\ni’m on a typo/graphic pathway, so something that deals with type quite nicely would be good.  \nand also, preferably something that can deal with fairly thick stock (up to 200gsm).  \nmy budget isn’t that great, £200 or £300 max, as i’m a student...  \noh, and something that works well on mac os X would be handy too!\n\nthanks...\n\n [‹ OpenType, now more open](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811070515/http:/typophile.com/node/14606 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [If Typography was a Video Game ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811070515/http:/typophile.com/node/14515 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It claims to take card but I’ve not tried it.\n\nEd.\n\n"

      "content": "We had this discussion not too long ago, and I ended up buying an HP 1320. I think it is more flexible with regards to stock, and also has a built in duplexer. However, and for whatever technical reasons, I find that the quality of the output suffers noticeable when using the duplexer. So when quality counts, I still do manual duplexing. I would say that it renders text quite well at its best quality setting. Its graphics printing is probably average for a 1200dpi laser printer. I do not know whether I would recommend this or not, since I haven’t directly compared its output to other similarly priced printers. The one Ed bought seems to be a better value overall, especially if you can get the Samsung on sale.\n\n"

It’s easy to maintain and couldn’t be simpler to replace toner etc. Oh and most importantly it’d fit your budget too!\n\n"
