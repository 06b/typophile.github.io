      "content": "Interesting!\n\nBut, like in many modular/geometric typefaces, some letters cause problems in terms of distinguishing them from another. Especially D≠O and V≠U. BTW, where has zero gone? ;)\n\nRegarding inconsistency… In some of your glyphs you avoid diagonals at any cost (e.g. V), in others you don‘t (X, Z, 7). Maybe you could either find a way to avoid them entirely or let other glyphs also “profit“ from breaking out of the strictly squarish grid.  \nTo me, the glyphs with a single stroke instead of the paper-clippy doubled stroke tend to stand out a bit too much (esp. S, 2 and 8). Maybe you could try to include some paper clips on these? Or how about overlapping the two shapes of the 8?\n\nAlso, the glyph widths seem dissonant to me – e.g. X looking too wide, H, T and 7 too narrow etc.  \nBut to judge this, a pangram or short sentence would be helpful.\n\nKeep it up,\n\njörg\n\n"

      "content": "Nice. I feel the letters should be really close together. This will create regular clusters of verticals here and there with the wide spaces of the letters in between. As it is, the spaces between the letters seem like letters themselves..I have not thought this out completely but yes, sample sentences with various spacing would help. The 8 is clever, but it looks flimsy with its two large unconnected pieces - unlike the logic of the other letters.\n\n"

Also, your design is not monospaced, so look at the proportions:'T'looks too narrow, 'J' too wide, things like that.\n\nYou have a good idea, just follow it through. I like the basic design.\n\n"

As the \"clippy looking things\" become more uniform my O & D, V & W, K, H, X & 8 are kind of difficult to tell apart. I was wondering if anyone knows of some fonts that totally avoid diagonal strokes or have solved some of the problems i've encountered successfully. Just looking for some inspiration.

Flipping the D around a horizontal axis might make it more D-like since the outline will then 'start' at the gap top left as one naturally writes it by hand. The tiny gaps where horizontal meets vertical in the black image gives an interesting 3D effect. In the black panel also, the curve that joins the two parallel lines is slightly pointy rather than a perfect semicircle - a shape you might consider for the font as a whole.\n\n"

      "content": "Maybe if you extended the doubled up line to or above the top on the /D/ and very little of that on the /O/ or maybe put it on the bottom....\n\nI don't like the /G/. It looks like \"...the lazy 009.\" You could easily make a capital G with your system, and especially since it is currently the only lowercase letter I would change it.\n\nThis is a really cool system that works well for a lot of the characters, but I'm sure you've noticed that the way the Q breaks the mold makes it stand out as the best letterform of the set. I think you need to break the rules more in order to make this a truly great font and to solve your differentiation issues. As it is now, I'd place this in the category of Electronics-inspired fonts—of which there are thousands—but if you are really going for string, paperclips, and neon lights, it should be a bit freer. At least use an angle or two.\n\nThat's my 2 cents...\n\n"
