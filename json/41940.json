  "content": "Hello all.\n\nI'm not a designer or typographer, just an editor. I edit a small-scale UK magazine. As well as covering current affairs we review films and music, but it's a pretty intelligent read -- sophisticated but pretty sober. We're relaunching next month, going from a mono interior to full colour.\n\nObviously fonts are a pretty big deal. It's the designer's call, but I got a few books and read up just because typography interests me. I also read a bunch of blogs and forums.\n\nBut here's the thing. I can't understand why Mrs Eaves wouldn't be a brilliant body text for us. I know it's pretty common now, and I know it draws attention to itself, but I like that it's full of character. In comparison most other things look bland, particularly the Baskerville alternatives that I get presented with.\n\nThe designer is with me to a certain extent. He says that he loves the way it looks, but that I should understand that typographers have a problem with it as a body text. Well, I guess I do, but only insofar as it wants to be seen. I do think it's readable despite all that.\n\nIf we use it it'll be 11.5 on 11.5, with column widths of around 75mm. We'll be printing onto good-quality 90gsm satin.\n\nSo, if you think my subscribers will benefit, please convince me that I'm wrong (with alternatives). The only other font I've seen that I really like is Fabiol, and I reckon you'd think that was worse...\n\nThanks.\n\n",

      "content": "I've set a book (over my protest) in Mrs. Eaves. The designer insisted on it. To my eye, it is so open & gappy you can drive smallish trucks between the letters. When you look for type for body copy -- text -- don't look at individual letterforms first. Look at sentences, or at least groups of words. Once you find fonts where that is comfortable, then look at letterforms if you wish.\n\nYes, it is readable. I once had a famous designer call me & exclaim \"I took all the word spaces out of the text, and I can still read it!\" I suppose you could. But why would anyone want to?\n\n"

The funky spacing and generous overshoots are really cute in small doses, but compound them with the high-contrast of the text and you’re making a recipe for annoyance. Also, keep your printing techniques in mind; if this magazine is coming out of a not-so-great press on low-cost paper, as small magazines often are, the hairlines in a Baskerville will start to break up and disappear, especially if you use a color that isn’t very dark. Topping it off, there’s a very historical feel to any Baskerville design, and it’s going to look very odd as body copy in a contemporary music and film magazine.\n\nConsider reserving Mrs. Eaves for flavor here and there in short articles, especially when the point size can be bumped up to compensate for magazine printing. But using it as body copy throughout probably won’t work out too well.\n\n"

There are myriad reasons, such as such and such, why you should listen to your designer.\"\n\nHow does that harm the designer?

That's also what the designer believes (or how he flatters me) and he seems keen to get my input. Of course I discuss this with him, I'm just canvassing for a little opinion. Also, I wonder how much of this stuff comes down to fashion. I've heard a number of things said about Mrs Eaves that just aren\"t true, and they appear to have been said as much in reaction to its popularity as to its inappropriateness.\n\nEqually, not all designers have typography as a strength, and some advice from people who take it seriously has to be worth seeking.\n\nBear in mind that I was asking you to convince me! I wasn't looking for ammunition to use against my designer.

I had an editor recently who insisted the type be miniscule because that would make it look \"contemporary\". Another client who won't allow purple because he read somewhere that purple doesn't sell. I felt sorry for the designer of my mother's book after she showed me the galleys and I marked up everything that didn't work.
