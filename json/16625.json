  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am a student of City College of San Francisco. I am learning type design and practicing how to use the FontLab. I designed a typeface which I haven't named it yet but wish you all can give me a feedback of how I did. The type was drew with Sharpie fine marker. I wrote on regular paper and created in many strokes, I scanned the lettering and traced them from the Illustrator.\n\nThank you!\n\nWai Har\n\n",
