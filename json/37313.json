  "content": "’ello all\n\nI was curious as to what type gurus like you use as their main typesetting/layout program? I have been using Adobe’s Indesign for like 4 years now and i’m pretty comfy and settled with it as it gives total control over type features. I cannot see any other software atm that matches it, even newest of Quarks, imho.\n\nAnd if anyone has made the upgrade to version CS3 of Indesign, is it that much of a revolution over CS2?, considering that i need to upgrade to an intel-based Mac for the program to run smoothly or whatever...\n\n [‹ Dan Rather's CBS Lawsuit?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924064709/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37341 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [propeller sign ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924064709/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37388 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Since I work on InDesign, I’m not going to give my subjective opinions. However, I can say that version CS3 is basically the same speed as CS2 on the same machine. The Intel Macs do run faster than PPC Macs, so it appears as if InDesign CS3 runs “smoother” on them, but you won’t see much difference on the same machine.  \nThe new features are listed at [http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/upgrade/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924064709/http:/www.adobe.com/products/indesign/upgrade/ \"http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/upgrade/\") .  \nSome text-related details that aren’t called out are: CS3 handles OpenType mark positioning and justification of marks better than CS2 and composed Unicode works better — these help Vietnamese and Thai. We also improved our handling of some obscure polytonic Greek details.\n\n"

I’m sure there are some major advances I haven’t found (and may never find), but it’s only been a few weeks.\n\nI prefer the new interface in the CS3 versions of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign (Illustrator hasn’t changed as much as the others).\n\nCS3 runs fine on older PPC Macs, it’s ’Universal’ so it runs natively on both PPC and Intel.  \nI’m using a 3.5-year-old PowerBook (1GB RAM) and it works perfectly.  \nFrom friends I have talked with, the main reason to upgrade is if you already have an Intel Mac, because CS2 runs like a dog on them.\n\nHowever, if you need to persuade someone that you _need_ a new Intel Mac then I’ll keep quiet ...\n\n"

I wish InDesign had kerning tables but I need to learn nested styles, I think that seems like a great tool.

But of course you know what happened to Quark, and eventually I switched to InDesign CS on my G3 so that I could have updated typesetting features that Quark wasn’t offering yet. After Quark 3.31, InDesign seemed like some Microsoft program—clunky as all get out. I still haven’t got totally comfortable with it after three years of daily use. I might just go back to Quark. Hopefully InDesign CS3 is better. The printers I use accept either Quark or InDesign, and most now prefer pdf anyway.\n\n"

Works for me - and my printer enjoys the files too. I have only one customer who demanded I make new mechanicals for them in InDesign - so I bought the CS (haven’t upgraded to even 2 yet!) and worked my buns off for them. Fortunately their printer still accepts Quark, and had even upgraded to Quark 7 - so he and I get along fine.\n\n**Meanwhile Patty** : _I wish Quark let you really lock objects and guides._  \nCan’t help you lock objects by guides really do lock these days. Quark now gives you, what we once paid for, XPert Tools - among them is XPert Guides - real easy - pull your guide to where you want it - click on it twice - lock it in - and if you are like me, change the green to blue...\n\nAnd you know, giving ems and strongs - is the closest I’ve come to old fashioned typesetting to date...\n\n"

Often I experimented with narrower columns of type pushed to one side, with drawings, etc., in the space created. Page numbers I’d embellish with coloured pencils with a graphic suitable to the topic. More effort usually went into the design of my projects than the research. I’d spend two weeks designing a cover and one night actually writing the text. For Christmas in my last year of high school I got my own typewriter—-a Smith-Corona manual portable. With that I figured I had university beat hands down! How times have changed!\n\n"

They’re still not perfect, but they add a whole new layer to production of table-heavy documents. For documents that I need to keep in CS2 format for some reason, I often build all the tables in CS3, then break the links to the styles and export the document to INX, then re-import into CS2: perfect tables in much less time.\n\nCS3 runs peachy on my PPC G5, btw.

Compugraphics masters were either 6 pt or 24 pt (which ever they were, Merganthaler was the other) so all point sizes were blown up or reduced from that master. What made Alphatype so wonderful is that they had several digital versions of the same face in different sizes - so when you chose say, 32 pt - you were getting it from a 36 pt master - or closer to the look of the original hot metal face...\n\nAhhhh\n\nI still enjoy a good Haber rule!\n\n"
