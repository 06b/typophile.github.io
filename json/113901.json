And actually, this sample all looks like Avant-Garde Gothic using some stylistic alternates and ligatures: [UT](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134044/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-book/glyphs.html#glyphs/540757/356), [NT](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134044/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-book/glyphs.html#glyphs/540757/342), [V](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134044/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-book/glyphs.html#glyphs/540757/302), [M](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134044/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-book/glyphs.html#glyphs/540757/292). Birth of A Hero is also a (illegal?) roughened version of Avant-Garde Gothic... Better go with the original...\n\n"
