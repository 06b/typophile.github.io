It's called _[vyaz](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013112318/http:/www.paratype.com/help/term/terms.asp?code=369)_. It is discussed and shown in a great number of Russian (and non-Russian) books on paleography and early printing. One good source that comes to mind is Зернова А. С. _Орнаментика книг московской печати кирилловского шрифта, 1677-1750_. Москва, 1963, but the titles are many. A fairly good listing of Russian books on type and typography can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013112318/http:/www.whitemouse.ru/font/b1900.wmb). By the way, Paul, the sample you have attached to your post is just god-awful.\n\n"

It's been 6 years since i was there now, so i can't remember whether there was any [vyaz](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013112318/http:/typophile.com/wiki/vyaz) in the mosaics in that particular church or not. i remember thinking that that style of lettering was particularly exquisite. i've been kicking myself for not buying a photo book on the spot, but wondering if i could still find one. can you recommend any online bookstores, Maxim? Oh, and I bought a ring with the inscription \"Господи Спаси и Сохрани Меня,\" (Lord, save and keep me) but i've lost it now. I wonder if i could find that online too...\n\n"

Just compare it with the [real thing](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013112318/http:/www.dni.ru/upimg/m_13656.jpg).\n\nAnd, speaking of a good, classical _vyaz_, have a look at the lettering on the [Ivan the Great Bell-Tower](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013112318/http:/www.cominf.ru/kremlin/images/glavakol.jpg) in the Kremlin (1505–8).\n\nNow the good news. It looks like your ring _was found_ by one Evgeny Kutuzov, a fan of the popular Russian actor [Nilkolay Karachentsov](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013112318/http:/www.karachentsov.ru/root/from_people/)...\n\n"

The compressed letterforms used in vyaz' begin life in Greek uncial lettering, and are related to the style of lettering often employed in Orthodox icons. In vyaz', the letters are compressed even more, and made to interlock in a variety of ways (shared stems, stacking, enclosure).\n\n"
