Interesting posibility for a display font.   \n   \nLook at Tiki Wood, here:   \n [http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=TIKICD-FO&sub=view](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024060938/http:/houseind.com/house.php?kit=TIKICD-FO&sub=view)   \n   \nBest,   \n   \nmh\n\n"

This might sound contradictory, but   \nyou need very rigid rules\\* to pull off this kind of design if   \nyou don't want it to end up looking amateuristic. More later.   \n   \n(\\*) Check out some Rian Hughes designs for comparison.\n\n"
