Handwritten type often gets \"stereotype\" so i need to make it more alive.\n\nI hope anyone can help.\n\nBenjamin\n\n",

Now, contextual alternates (which work automatically in the latest versions of Adobe software) make typesetting with Handsome look even more like real writing. Not only that, but the range of “pens” has been extended to six styles, with Thin (much like a “Fineliner”) and Extra Bold (rather like “Speedball Fat”) versions at either end of the weight spectrum, Classic (a super-elegant version of Nib) and Rough, which simulates the effect of a rollerball or fine-tipped felt-nib pen on ordinary paper, with a subtle “bleed”.\n\n"
