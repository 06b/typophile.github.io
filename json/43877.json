Just look carefully, It's a big book but I belive there's no type specimens besides that particular section.  \nI can't remember the name right now, but i'm sure you'll find it in there. Although the cover lettering it's a outlined version of it.  \nI'll check that out later this evening.\n\n;)\n\n"
