  "content": "I was just wondering what some people thought were the best serif faces ever, and/or the trendiest serif face ever? This is partly for a project I'm working on at school where I have to design a specimen book for the fonts of my choice. The concept for the book is \"the fashionable serif\" and all of the book will be based on fashion. I'm going to creat t-shirts with the specimen on the front and the name across the back like a baseball jersey. Anyways, any thoughts on the best serifs would be great.   \nI'm particularly fond of Goudy.\n\n",

But Perpetua isn't just some anachronistic affectation: it's timeless. Well, at least timeless in relation to Western culture.   \n   \nPerpetua is austere, without being oppressive. It has a serious grace that doesn't need to prove itself. In comparison, Adobe Trajan is a Roman legionnaire who's been spending way too much time in Bay Area Starbuckses.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Rolling Stone Magazine uses a beautiful version that they commissioned for their body face.   \n   \nI also like Parkinson (Jim Parkinson), also based on Jenson.   \n   \nGolden Type (William Morris), Centaur & Arrighi (Bruce Rogers, Frederic Warde) and Adobe Jenson (Robert Slimbach) are also worthy interpretations of the Jenson design forms.   \n   \nI'm working on my own design, Architrave, which is partly (and loosely) based on the Jenson model, and is currently showing in the Serif Critique forum.   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
