However, it only saves a few KB, so I'm not sure why one would bother.\n\n"

      "content": "No, the outline references are a different situation. You asked about bitmaps. Bitmaps were the pixel fonts contained within suitcases that were used to render text in OS 9 and before. This only came into play if you didn't have ATM-Light installed, which under OS 9 would have been very unusual. On the early, pre-ATM Macs, if you didn't have lots of bitmap sizes text wouldn't render as nicely.\n\nThe outline references can also be modified by Font Doctor with it's Move Fonts feature--basically a clone of an ancient utility called DA Font Mover. I would not really recommend this either. In fact, if you collect fonts out of Suitcase Fusion, they will always be separated into one face per suitcase. This is partly related to Suitcase Fusion's face-level activation. Fonts that are correctly named for family style-linking still show up in modern applications as a family. However, in an OS X environment, it is no longer necessary to have them occupy the same suitcase file. It's better if they're separate, like OTF fonts. Then, as in your example, if you want to give someone just the Bold weight it's easy to do so.\n\n"
