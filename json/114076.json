  "content": "Hi everybody, I am trying to find a font similar to JAF Bernini Sans which our team loves but we are doing a website that has a lot of similarities to Medium.com and since they use that font we want to have a different font so that we don't feel so much like we are copying them.\n\nThis is to be used for the web so its important that it renders well on different screens. And one thing we love about JAF Bernini Sans is that it looks great on bold headlines (like on Medium.com) but also works great for small text (which is the font used on typographica.org for their small text).\n\nSo if anybody has any recommendations for similar fonts that will render well I will really appreciate your help.\n\nAnd here is the link to JAF Bernini Sans so you see the font:\n\n[http://justanotherfoundry.com/bernini-sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150307043333/http:/justanotherfoundry.com/bernini-sans \"http://justanotherfoundry.com/bernini-sans\")\n\n",
