  "content": "Please pardon the garbled title, it describes pretty accurately what I’m currently wondering about… (and my state of mind, probably, too.)\n\nI’m designing/typesetting a booklet and have come across some words (in languages like French and German) that take optional feminine endings. In the typoscript they’re set in parentheses to show that both forms are included. This is not unusual, but rather ugly:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415065752im_/http:/typophile.com/files/parens-big_4976.gif)\n\nIs it possible that there might be a way to use smaller parentheses here (these are from the smallcaps)? Or am I crazy? Do these look out of place?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415065752im_/http:/typophile.com/files/parens-small_5178.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415065752im_/http:/typophile.com/files/parens-french_5981.png)\n\nI’d appreciate feedback, or any ideas / tales of precedent for how this might be typeset in a way that is both recognizable, and not too disruptive/ugly. Thanks!\n\n",

And even if very few laymen could consciously put a finger on the full-size parens bothering them, they would still benefit from the smaller ones.\n\nOne thing to worry about no matter what size parens you use, but especially if you use \"unexpected\" ones: many designers don't includne kerning for things preceding a left paren (or things beyond punctuation following a right paren).\n\nBTW, optionality is often indicated with square brackets, not parens - but those would generally be more jarring.\n\nhhp\n\n"

But check out the kerning: in the German text example, it seems to me that you need to increase the kerning a little in some cases: in ...e(n) and ...r(in), for example, the e and r and nearly touching the parenthesis, and its seems that some more space is needed there.\n\n"

In linguistics one often encounters things that are either optional or contextually dependent, surrounded with parentheses. Since parens are mostly cap-height or ascender height, the effect is jarring. See this list of suffixes, for example: _‑ch_, _‑k(w)_, _‑x(w)_, _‑(ʼ)n_, _‑ts_.\n\nThere are pairs of Unicode parens for superscript and subscript elements which are very useful for phonetic transcriptions that use a lot of superscript and – to a lesser extent – subscript modifiers. These are far more readable than their full-sized parenthesis counterparts: ‑k⁽ʷ⁾, ‑tɬ⁽ʹ⁾, tʃ⁽ʰ⁾‑, ‑l⁽ˤ⁾, ‑t₍.₎s‑, ‑ŋ₍₊₎ versus ‑k(ʷ), ‑tɬ(ʼ), tʃ(ʰ)‑, ‑l(ˤ), ‑t(.)s‑, ‑ŋ(₊). (Pretend that those examples are all in an appropriate typeface rather than mangled by your browser.) Having a similar pair of parentheses for x-height elements would be a major typographic improvement, though I imagine it would take some time to catch on given that the superscript and subscript ones are only beginning to see regular use.\n\n"
