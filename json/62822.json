  "content": "Two questions:  \n1) What's the tradition wrt the spacing of bold-type text?  \n Was it set with more spacing than medium-weight text?  \n2) Is it only me[^1] or does bold text in most fonts become  \n more readable if some spacing is added?\n\n[^1]: I have a problem with peripheral vision so it might  \n very well be just me. However since my field of vision  \n is narrow I typically want blocks of text to be narrower,  \n not wider.  \n/BP\n\n",
