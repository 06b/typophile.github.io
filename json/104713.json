      "content": "These are hints that are used to control vertical alignment of features that do not involve horizontal stems. The obvious example would be the top and bottom of a _sans serif_ letter I. There is no serif to function as a horizontal stem, and hence nothing to which to link a standard stem hint. Ghost hints are used here to attach the top and bottom of the letter to vertical alignment (blue) zones.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809175340im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ghosts_6193.png)\n\n"
