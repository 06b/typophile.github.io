  "content": "Hello all—\n\nJust wondering. I’m thinking of finally making my own Font family but I was wondering:\n\nWould it be too much to ask to do all the work myself but to ask another to simply convert the .ai vectors into an actual font using the appropriate software? I have everything I need... my hands and Illustrator... but I don’t have a font program and as this stage in the game it’s far too much to invest in.\n\nThat was my only question. I’m not quite sure how much work it’d be to take ready-made letters and then, bring them into the correct software.\n\nMuchas Gracias—\n\n",

Plus characters will need to be re-drawn along the way. You’re seeking a patient saint!\n\nYou never know what people are willing to do though. Maybe there’s a business niche being missed for out-sourced kerning and hinting.\n\n"

If they like the design, most of these places will develop your drawings into a functioning typeface. There may be some independent type designers around here that would do the same for a fee, and/or split in royalties. It really depends on the appeal of your design. You might want to post some word settings to see if folks are interested.\n\n"

      "content": "Kyle, there are multiple reasons to design in a font program rather than Illustrator, including: 1. You can easily preview your letters in combination with other letters, in words, at will. This is critical to a good font. 2. There are problems transferring from Illustrator to a font program, so it is easier for all concerned to start in a font program. Google with preface of site:typophile.com, and you will find threads on it. 3. The drawing tools in font programs themselves make it easier to adjust curves for letters. I think that anyone who does it will tell you that investing $99 for a basic program is worth it. And also get “Learn FontLab Fast”. Then when it comes to kerning and all the technical stuff and expansion of character set, etc., you may, if it is good, be able to get a foundry to do it with by sharing profits, or, if not, paying them to do the work.\n\n"
