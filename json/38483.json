  "content": "Sort of.\n\nGeorge Williams has extended FontForge to support Raph Levien’s Spiro curves.  \nUnfortunately, the process to install everything and make it function correctly is quite opaque to me.  \nFor purposes of licensing and patents and other things I don’t understand, the Spiro libraries are not included in the basic install of the latest FontForge, so some other stuff I don’t readily understand has to be done to get them all working together.\n\nThere is a Gobuntu build recipe at [http://understandinglimited.com/2007/10/26/ff-spiro/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091029153712/http:/understandinglimited.com/2007/10/26/ff-spiro/) which looks like a bunch of UNIX gobbledygook to me.\n\nIf anyone knows how to get it working on Mac OS X 10.4 X11, please share with us. I’d be much obliged.\n\n",

If you know any Fink gurus, you might also talk to them.\n\nIn any case, it looks like this job will take considerable time and patience. The fact that the instructions ask you to get FontForge from CVS suggests that there hasn’t yet been an official release with Spiro support. When such a release becomes available, the install process may get simpler.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
