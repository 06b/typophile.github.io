Alternatively, type the pair into the preview part of the panel and click on the right glyph of the pair; this will highlight the pair in the kerning list.  \nClick on this kerning pair's line in the kerning list; do this even if it is highlighted already!  \nIn OSX, hit the 'back' key. In Windows it might be the 'delete' key, I don't know.\n\n"

It is important that you open the script in a text editor first and assign your own identifier tags which identify your classes as leftside, rightside (and exception). Else the script won't work. Also see the notes in the text file.
