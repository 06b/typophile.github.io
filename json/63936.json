  "content": "I am addicted to neo sans and tech today haha. Here is another concept created today let me know what you guys think. I used the L to make a path in the symbol. I really feel like the path is too rounded at the bottom left and making that less rounded will help the shape work. Let me know what you guys think.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023005508im_/http:/typophile.com/files/leadmesh3_6590.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Yup. But even without it there's nothing \"leading\" or \"meshy\" about the second set of marks. The first set is somewhat better as it implies following, but the L in the arrow is lost to the presence of a turn in the road, which implies sudden change of direction, which in turn carries a bunch of negative connotations.\n\n"
