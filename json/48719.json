Why does the guy at the top left not have his arm behind the guy at the top right?\n\nI’m also not sure that the combination of 4-fold rotational symmetry and a German name is a good idea - the negative space <cite>sort of</cite> looks like a swastika.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

The implementation was a bit of a nightmare here, though I’m still convinced that the idea itself should work quite well, if it is implemented with more attention to detail.

So I thought including a human element in the logo would be a good way to go.\n\n[Webdesign Hamburg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122111949/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n"

I think your latest post is interesting. although the space between the “i” and “m” looks too loose to me.\n\n“I like it a lot but it makes the company look like a watch business, no?”\n\nbut with the name Time Zeit won’t people automatically think of watches and clocks?\n\nIt may be over done and too complicated for your mark but the time 9:00 - 5:00 “9 to 5” typically represents a work day (here in the states anyway. I would assume other countries have a similar phrase) I’m just throwing this out there to get you thinking about time, people and work in more meaningful ways.\n\nThe posting prior to the straight typographic solution, had lost the swastica look to me (and actually looked more like a button). That is what happens with symbols, people attach cultural and personal meanings to them. I think you deftly altered the mark to erase any connections to a swastica. How do you feel about that design? I get the sense that you prefer the 4 people concept over the logotype.\n\n"

I also don’t think that reducing the number of men to three is a good idea - it will look a lot like the ubuntu logo then.\n\nWhat does your one colour version look like?\n\nAn idea - if each of the four guys had two hands, there would be a total of twelve dots around the circle, like a clock. Don’t know if this will work, look good, or whatever, but just a thought.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
