Set the layer effects to Bevel and Emboss, and select Emboss and choose down as the direction. Adjust the depth and everything until it looks right. Subtlety goes a long way here.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020005823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/faux_emboss_5886.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Fred Goudy's fonts were arguably the first to imitate a letterpress effect, especially Kennerley (1911).  \nAlthough he was working with metal type, there was sufficient distance, in terms of resolution, between his subject material of relatively crude Renaissance text typography, and the large, sharp letters he was able to create with refined early 20th century printing technology, to allow an objective historical perspective to be expressed in letter details which were informed by the trace of process.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020005823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Phoenix_6689.png)\n\nThis is a display setting of Kennerley from 1920 (you can see from the text show-through). Note the blobbyness (in imitation of ink spread) and flex of the serifs, the drastic thinning at the joint of \"h\", and the fly-away tittle, after Jenson.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020005823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Poly_5829.png)\n\nPoliphilus was conceived at Monotype in 1923 as a photographically-engineered simulacrum and facsimile-maker of Renaissance typography.\n\nSo to a certain extent such types incorporate in their design the artefacts and effect of letterpress printing, in whatever medium they are rendered, be it letterpress, offset, or screen.\n\n"
