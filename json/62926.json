  "content": "Hello everyone. I am a digital illustrator who recently branched out into freelance design work. I am not too advanced in using text in illustrator. I am recreating a logo for a motorcycle company that has a similar look to Harley Davidson's logo. My problem is I can't get the text to arch in the same way the text that says 'Motor' and 'Cycles' in the Harley logo. I know the Harley logo might be custom but how do I get text to arch so smoothly along that kind of angle? Any help would be appreciated!\n\nAndrew\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [HarleyDavidsonLogo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201105229/http:/typophile.com/files/HarleyDavidsonLogo.gif) | 23.23 KB |\n\n",
