  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI have a problem with various font files on one of my systems. They appear perfectly on one system, but on the other the \"BoldItalic\" is actually \"Thin\", the \"Hairline\" is \"Normal\" (etc etc etc.... it varies with the font in question).\n\nSome fonts are from Adobe Font Folio OpenType Edition (the original one), and one is \"Omnes\" by Joshua Darden. They appear perfect on my laptop, but as I don't use them on my laptop but on my desktop, it's a PITA! :D\n\nThe only difference between the two systems is that the laptop (where the fonts are fine) is XP SP2, whereas my design machine is XP SP3. I don't know if this has anything to do with it...\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nMany thanks,\n\nMartin\n\n",

Just tried it on another XP (SP3) partition on my workstation, and when the fonts are NOT installed, double clicking on the file name (previewing the fonts) works fine.
