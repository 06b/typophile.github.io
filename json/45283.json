The 'Koller' one is taken from an engraved name plate, the other one is from an old Tamiya RC car decal.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024003914im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Koller_4124.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024003914im_/http:/typophile.com/files/upset_5142.jpg)\n\n",

I looked through the Solotype Catalog and saw a script called Davenport (p.86) that looks like it might be similar to the style used, but not enough letters were shown to see if it was more than similar. I also scanned through the Nick Curtis fonts, hoping it was something he had revived, but didn't see it.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
