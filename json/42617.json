Try making it 600px wide, and get rid of the whitespace.\n\nFrom what I can see: get rid of the gradient at this point in the process. Also, work on a version without the tagline - integrating a logo with a tagline is dangerous, since clients often want to change a tagline.\n\nSeems like a good start - I look forward to seeing it reposted!\n\n"

      "content": "Where it’s definitely “creatif” it’s also over designed. The word mark is interesting, but once you start adding the other elements it gets crowded and overly complex. I agree with Beth’s suggestions. For the initial, start with a straight black and white design, minus taglines and revolving elements (like the Xacto).\n\nFocusing on the wordmark, the “TiF” seems compressed and smooshed onto the end, and I think the “F”’s arms could extend further out. The balance and rhythm seem out of whack.\n\nAs for the Xacto, you could use this element in several renditions including a version with a pen, pencil, paintbrush, etc... But right now it’s a very heavy bottom element and could be thinned and elongated.\n\nThe font choice for your tag line is too different, the majority of your design is very angular, the C being the only noticeable curve. Maintain this look. It’s hard to justify a curved font with this logo.\n\nI know I’ve been pretty harsh. The logo has a distinct look, but it’s at a point were it should either be pulled back or pusher further. Keep up the good work, enjoy the process and make mistakes!\n\n"
