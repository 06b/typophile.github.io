That is to say, it does nothing to address the problem that caused the artificial boom. The reason we're in a 'crisis' at this point is because economic law, as it tends to _always_ do, is now proposing an actual, feasible solution: the liquidation of bad debt.  \nIf the congress thinks it can monetize its way out of a recession, they just as well repeal the law of gravity while they're at it.  \nNow notice the words we're using: Bailout v. _Rescue plan_, Bust v. _Market correction_, Worthless junk v. _Illiquid assetts_. Notably, one of the 'toned-down' terms perfectly describes what is now occurring and exactly what we need: a market correction; and not surprisingly, that is precisely what our congress is trying to prevent, even at the peril of its reelection. \n",
