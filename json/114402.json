  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am currently working on a logo design for a bespoke furniture company based in Oslo, Norway.\n\nThe client wants to communicate a sense of solidity and modern design, just as the furniture they design for their clients. I showed him this concept and he liked it. I would like to know your opinions about it and suggestions on how to refine it (kerning etc...) .\n\nThank you very much for your attention,\n\nPierluigi\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419092254im_/http:/typophile.com/files/arquitech_6418.jpg)\n\n",
