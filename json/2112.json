For one thing, it requires grammatical sensitivity to work really well.   \n   \nBTW, don't focus on Javal's specifics too much: he was a stellar pioneer, but for that reason it was too early for him to be very exact about the details of readability.   \n   \n--   \n   \nBTW, one can't doubt that Clearview works very well for the intended purpose: highway signage.

      "content": "\\> why is most highway signage sanserif   \n   \nPart of it is cultural, but there's also the difference between legibility and readability, in terms of the reader having time to decipher a short word in the fovea (by compiling the letters, which have to be highly decipherable in adverse conditions of weather and lighting) versus immersive reading. Sans forms are more decipherable during deliberation. And note for example that highway signage is loosely spaced, while that's anathema in a book.   \n   \nBTW, one practical consideration for setting text on a fire extinguisher is that it's on a narrow cylinder, so you want a narrow font (unless you set the text along the length, which might however momentality confuse people), since you don't please having to twist the thing back-and-forth to read lines.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "\\> why is most highway signage sanserif   \n   \nThe simpler and more realistic answer to this question is that, at least in the US, highway signage comes down from both sign painting and an engineering template lettering. Sans Serif glyphs are easier to paint, and to render via a template.. In the case of Standard Highway Alphabet Series B,C,D,E, Emod, these were derived from what is essentially Leroy lettering, with some of the round terminals squared off.   \n   \nClearviewHwy is a sans because it would have been impossible to get highway engineers to consider a serif, hell, it was almost impossible to get them to consider ClearviewHwy at all.\n\n"

If the lights are out, it will even talk to you.   \n   \nWe're a little bit along the way with the preferences users apply to web pages (as well as Text Zoom).   \n   \nLettError's Twin font, with the selection of glyph alternates being database-driven, is another step forward.   \n   \nEven without a dynamic interface, there are options, and could be more. Shania's latest album was recorded in Country, Pop, and Dance (europe only) mixes, color-coded. Many books come in large-print options. Harry Potter came with alternate adult and child covers, but the guts were the same. On-demand publishing should be able to offer readers a choice of settings. \"Would you like that in Bembo or Times, or, for the really adventurous, perhaps a sans serif?\"\n\n"
