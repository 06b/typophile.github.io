  "content": "I'm designing a 250-or-so page Hebrew book. It's my first, and as I'm not used to reading long stretches of Hebrew text, I'm wondering which font to use for the main body copy.\n\nThe obvious suggestions were FrankRuel, David, Narkis, and Hadassah. Of those four, I most prefer the Narkis for the bodycopy and FrankRuel for the headings. Any additional suggestions to consider?\n\nJust as good, are there particular editions of these standards which excel in anyone's opinion? I've seen Hagilda's FrankReul and it looks quite beautiful. I'm also taken by FontBit's Hadassah Chadash, as well as Oded Ezer's Meoded Serif (both only as display faces). Thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414014110im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-4_6111.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414014110im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-5_6385.gif)\n\n",

They have a superior version of FrankRuhl. Also, Scott Keofsky's Milon has many advantages over FontBit's New Hadasa.\n\nWho is doing the typesetting?\n\nOnly modern texts, like those used in Israel, use Narkiss for the body text. If your audience is the Mishna Brura crowd, Narkiss is not a good choice.\n\n"

And it will be marketed almost exclusively in Israel. Almost zero nikkud, and I'm setting the type from a Word doc provided by the client.\n\nWhere could I see Scott Keofsky’s Milon? Thanks\n\n/\\/\\\n\n"
