  "content": "Hi.\n\nSuppose I have purchased a typeface which I wish to rework with a script I have made, to make a totally different typeface based on the original, like here (comic sans):\n\n[http://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%204.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014230254/http:/www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%204.jpg \"http://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%204.jpg\")  \n [http://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%205.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014230254/http:/www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%205.jpg \"http://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%205.jpg\")  \n [http://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%206.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014230254/http:/www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%206.jpg \"http://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%206.jpg\")\n\nSomething similar actually done by Umbrella TF:  \n [http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000144#specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014230254/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000144#specimen \"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000144#specimen\")\n\nIs it legal and what license restrictions apply here?\n\nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "Usually, you are prohibited from taking a font you have licensed and using its outlines and other data to make another, whether that new creation is very similar or very distinct from the original. You can typically modify the outlines of the font in a program like Illustrator, but you usually cannot make a font out of your modifications. You can usually create a new font based on a previous design if the original is a printed specimen, i.e. not first created in digital form.\n\nI've emphasized that this is what I believe many _(not all)_ [EULA](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014230254/http:/typophile.com/wiki/EULA)s require, but as Tiffany said, you should examine the license agreement of the foundry you are considering licensing the font from and e-mail or call them if you have any questions.\n\nAs for the recommendation, you should try searching Typophile first (I know I've seen a thread about rounded type recently) and then make a new post in General Discussions if you want more or more specific recommendations.\n\n"

However, some foundries, such as Adobe, do allow you to modify their fonts and use them internally for other work.\n\n"
