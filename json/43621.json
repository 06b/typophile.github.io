I hope you understand what I'm trying to explain.  \nI'm looking for some fonts like that for a project and will really appreciate if you could help me starting out giving me well known (and maybe less) fonts of that kind so I can try searching around. I'm missing some vocabulary too, is prismatic engraved really apropriate words to usually describe those fonts ?  \nThanks.\n\n",

Here are some examples at myfonts to illustrate :  \n [goudy handtooled](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109014254/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/goudy-handtooled/)  \n [burlington](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109014254/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/burlington/)  \nI need some bases to start, any well known types of that taste ?  \nI'm looking for something bold (well, not too much), with great curves, scripty, elegant.\n\n"
