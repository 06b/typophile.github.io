To me, they could have started with Helvetica Neue, replaced /o by a circle (link with icon?) and tried (and failed) to make this type memorable by tweaking /a.  \nBTW, what the font did they use to write \"a [...] company\"? Avenir x DIN? Could be a track to follow...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123348im_/http:/typophile.com/files/google_company_6558.jpg)\n\n"
