  "content": "I'm very new to this forum. Hello to everyone.\n\nFor my final work (bachelor) I made a geometric sanserif typeface, for which I created 3 posters. I wanted to use typofoto as it was a technique widely used in the 1920's, the 'time' of geometric typefaces. After reading LetterLetter I also wanted to imitate the look of the first specimens from the 18th century. I used photo-etching, made plates, printed and used photoshop to layer them. I wonder if I achieved the right effect and ask for some help - I would like to make it look more 'nowadays', but don't really know how to do that. Any comments?\n\nPosters are on these links:\n\n[poster1](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310021818/http:/i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd64/playground15/pero.gif)\n\n[poster2](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310021818/http:/i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd64/playground15/cherry-1.gif)\n\n[poster3](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310021818/http:/i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd64/playground15/creation.gif)\n\n",
