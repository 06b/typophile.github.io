So in that spirit, I built this quick flash app to make your own Obama-style graphics!\n\nLink: [http://rocdove.com/blog/obama-graphic-generator/109](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019144828/http:/rocdove.com/blog/obama-graphic-generator/109 \"http://rocdove.com/blog/obama-graphic-generator/109\")\n\nAnyway, thought typophiles might get a kick out of it. If you come up with something clever, post it! I'd love to see what other people come up with.\n\n-Brendan\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019144828im_/http:/typophile.com/files/changethistext_3737.jpg)\n  \n(my submission) \n",

Sort of like how Apple didn't invent putting a reflection under everything, but it took off after they started doing it. That's how it seems to me anyway.\n\n"
