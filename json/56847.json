  "content": "I'm curious if it's worth it to try to make it to Justified West, aside from an opportunity to hang out with a large collection of Type nerds. I need to justify, (ha!), the expense of registration and accommodations, if only to myself.\n\nThe parts all look interesting, and all of the speakers are cool looking dudes and dudettes of Typophile, but only one of the parts directly relates to my own profession as a web designer, which is Zara's part on mobile typography.\n\nWhat could I possibly say to my boss to try to get him to chip in on expenses? Is there anything I might be missing out on if I don't go?\n\n",
