  "content": "Hello All,\n\nI am new to typography and I am trying to create a font set with Fontlab. But I am having trouble making the capital letter “O” evenly wide in thickness all the way around.\n\nFor example, if I draw the black circle/oval in guidelines of (0,0) to (400,1000) and the white circle/oval in guidelines (100,100) to (300,900) I get an oval shaped “O”. Then the mid-points of “O” i.e. the vertical mid-point measurement from (200,0) to (200,100) and (200,900) to (200,1000) is 100. Similarly the horizontal mid-point measurement from (0,500) to (100,500) and (300,500) to (400,500) is 100. So the width of the character line at these points is 100 but the width of the character line at other parts is not 100.\n\nDoes anyone know how to make the “O” even all the way around at 100 units thickness.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ So how do I learn this whole encoding thing?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705163831/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45286 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Installing AFDKO ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705163831/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45236 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Move the circle to anywhere along the inner contour between the top or bottom and one of the sides. Adjust the curve of the outer contour until it touches the edge of the circle. Move the circle further along the curve and adjust the outer contour as needed. When one quadrant looks okay, note the lengths of the control nodes of the outer contour in the adjusted section. Use the same values for the other three sections. In this method, the inner contour controls the overall shape. If you prefer the outer contour, you would adjust the inner contour instead. Note, however, that this will result in corners at the top and bottom of the inside of the O, which you probably don’t want.\n\n"

Then, do Contour \\> Paths \\> Make Parallel Path... with a setting of 100 units. (Depending on the direction of the path, you may need to change it from left to right or right to left. Also, the path directions will need to be corrected after the procedure, since they will end up going the same direction, which you don’t want.) If you don’t add the extra nodes, the result will be identical to your initial example. The extra nodes force the distance to be the same all the way around (or at least closer to that ideal).\n\nHere’s how it looks:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705163831im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/ellipses_4523.gif)\n\nThe one on the left is your original O, the one on the right was constructed starting from the inner contour with extra nodes added and the Make Parallel Path command.\n\n"

If this is true, the further away you are, the smaller the shapes will appear, and the more overshoot you will need. I’m not so sure about this. I’ve never noticed O’s appearing smaller relative to flat-sided letters when they were farther away. In any case, if it were true, it would be impractical to do anything about it, given that type may be set at virtually any size and viewed at any arbitrary distance.

Adobe Illustrator places the extra nodes closer to the top and bottom, which presumably are the optimum places to put them.\n\nThe extra nodes may not be strictly necessary. It may in some cases be possible to draw a curve with only the top, bottom and side nodes that is very close to the same as the one with the extra nodes. But there is a limit to the kind of contour you can make with just two control points. You cannot make every possible curve that would fit between the two nodes. In fact, as William pointed out, even a circle can only be very closely approximated—not a perfect circle—when described with Bézier curves. If you can’t get the curve you want, you may need to add nodes. But don’t use more than you need.\n\n"

Rather I felt that\n\n1-Illusions are not quantifiable and a beginner (like me) can over-do this fine-tuning and the result would be just as ’wrong’\n\n2- In some scripts like Arabic, or for some fonts that are less than mainstream in design, or some uses like advertising or illustration, illusions may be acceptable. They may even enhance certain glyphs in close-viewing situations or in certain combinations with other glyphs by providing visual variety in unexpected ways.\n\n"

      "content": "Vladimir, the illusion rules are partly quantified, but there is a whole lot that hasn’t been quantified yet. For example, generally, overshoots are said to work in the 2-3% range. But it is also argued that they should be different for bold characters and pointed characters. And Matthew Carter has said that he generally thinks that the S needs slightly less overshoot to look balanced.\n\nI think knowing the general guidelines is very useful, but equally important is not to view them as iron-clad rules, but instead to rely on your eyes.\n\nThis is assuming you want the balance such guidelines are aimed at achieving. Your design may not want such balance, particularly in a display face. For example if you have a ’bouncy’ baseline, you might want to have a character look shorter. Or if you wanted it to look brutally mechanical, you might want the heaviness that geometric equality of horizontal and vertical can give in roman script.\n\nI think the ’rules’ do change to some extent from script to script. In the Roman script the rule is heavy verticals and thin horizontals. Our eyes are accustomed to that, so violating that looks heavy, whereas in another script with different underlying ’rules’ it won’t.\n\nSo there is a mixture of the universal—the way human visual perception works—and partly conditioning by the usual rules of the script.\n\nOverall, I think the thing is to be aware of how what we see and what is on the paper or screen are significantly different, and then to make a conscious decision on how to deal with the differences to get the effect we want in the viewer.\n\n"

I am currently finalizing an Arabic font that has all its line widths equal - I wonder what is a good description for such an attribute: doesn’t ’mono-width’ refer to equal overall width of the glyphs between their sidebearings? Indeed some portions of my glyphs appear thicker or thinner than others because of illusions, but somehow I find that acceptable. In large sizes I like the clean ’absolute’ or ’pure’ look of the outlines. Are there any good Latin or other scrips that have equal outline widths?\n\n"

      "content": "\\>Are there any good Latin or other scrips that have equal outline widths?\n\nI don’t know of any, though there might well be. I just checked Avant Garde in the big sizes you can display on Font Shop and even there the O seems to be slightly thinner on the top and bottom compared to the sides.\n\nThere are reversed-contrast fonts, though. The ’Old West’ slab styles are like this, though they are kind of novelty display faces. The most famous reversed-contrast sans is Antique Olive, and a more recent one FF Balance. I don’t like either of these personally, but they are well crafted and have a certain look.\n\nI don’t read Arabic script, but here would be my guess: equal weight of horizontal and vertical strokes will still make the horizontals look heavier than the verticals, because that’s the way the eye & brain work. But since the Arabic script is generally heavier in the horizontals, it might well not cause the problems it does in roman styles, and the letter forms may still look “normal.” So I can conceive of it working fine, though I really don’t know.\n\nAn interesting comparison might be the recent Hebrew typeface Erica sans, whose name is a tribute to Eric Gill’s sans. Hebrew script also follows the heavy horizontal light vertical rule—maybe it’s connected with right to left writing? And generally I think doing the latin script rules in Hebrew letters looks awful. But somehow the designer here brought it off brilliantly, and this face won a TDC award and is now very popular in Israel. You can read an interview with the designer [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705163831/http:/www.oketz.com/iontef/).\n\n"

On the other hand there is the strictly geometrical kufic which has equal width for both. The Arabic in Arial font follows the general rule but the Hebrew there has thin horizontals and thick verticals!\n\nThis thread started out with a discussion of a perfectly round O, a feature of Johnston’s London Underground lettering and Gill’s adaptation.

When an inner contour has the reverse direction of the outer, where the two overlap is subtracted so you get a proper O shape with a hollow centre. If both contours run clockwise or both anticlockwise the inside O will be filled- there is a little arrow on each contour that shows the direction. Study the Fontlab 4.6 manual for alternate ways to reverse the contours for example by trying “set PS direction or Set TT direction” buttons if they exist, as they do on the 5.0 version. Good luck.\n\n"
