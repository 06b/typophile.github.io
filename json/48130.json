But I don't know much about typography, so I'd be very grateful if somebody could tell me the name of the font and/or the name of this _kind_ of font (is there a family into which it belongs?).\n\nMany thanks,\n\nSam\n\n",

The 1970 ones are closest to what I'm after, but they have a slanted bar in the 'e'. Ideally, I'd want a straight bar.\n\n[Harry](http://web.archive.org/web/20120414235017/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1B.html) is pretty close too, but has a curved descender on the y, whereas I prefer a straight descender.\n\nThe hunt is on!\n\n"

Unlike the font in the headphones publicity, it has no stem (is this the correct term?) on the r, but that doesn't bother me.\n\nPS. Lex, I meant to thank you in my last post, for getting the ball rolling! Thanks :)\n\n"
