  "content": "I am leafing through the beautiful ATF Specimen book (from 1912), and find myself slowly falling in love with the delightfully quirky Cheltenham family.  \nThe only digital version I could find (ITC) seems to've lost much of it's charm (along with a handful of ligatures and text figures.) I recognize the merits of the new design, homogenizing upper and lower cases for modern sensibility, but miss the quirk. At least they kept that funny lower-case g :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020034239im_/http:/typophile.com/files/chal_4865.png)\n\nAre there other recreations, more faithful to the original design?\n\n",
