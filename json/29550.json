  "content": "The font used on Air Force One is usually said to be Palatino (for example, [http://typophile.com/node/19363](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228174021/http:/typophile.com/node/19363 \"http://typophile.com/node/19363\")), but it doesn't really look like Palatino to me. For instance, the serifs in Palatino are flat vertical or horizontal lines, while the serifs in the AF1 font are at a 45 degree angle (except in the arms of the E and F) and look like arrowheads. Is it a custom US government version of Palatino, or is it some other font completely?\n\nThe attachment is a portion of the full photo, which can be found at [http://www.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/021126-O-9999G-023.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228174021/http:/www.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/021126-O-9999G-023.jpg \"http://www.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/021126-O-9999G-023.jpg\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [af1 text.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228174021/http:/typophile.com/files/af1%20text.jpg) | 16.1 KB |\n\n",

But the video was revealed to be an elaborate hoax. The first clue: the typeface on the fuselage isn't quite right! (Apparently Ecko rented a jet and painted it to resemble the Presidential plane.) There are other clues that are more obvious to airplane geeks. The video is done well and it's worth watching if you can appreciate a craven PR stunt.\n\nSkylar\n\n"

It seems quite likely to me that this lettering was not made using a font, considering what it is being used on, so anything we suggest would just be a way to make something similar. I agree with Lex's pick, and also Oldstyle No.2, which may have been the typeface that Binney Old Style was based on.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
