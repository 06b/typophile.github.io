  "content": "So I was looking through my font list and I found that I have 3 separate versions of Garamond. I have [Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312204039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Garamond), Garamond Premier Pro, and Adobe Garamond Pro.\n\nBeing rather new to the world of typography I was wondering what the difference(s) between them was. So I put the three styles next to each other and I noticed some differences in stroke weight, stress, density and so on but I figured I would see if there was anyone on here that could explain to me what is so different about the three.  \nPerhaps its a stupid question.\n\n",

It's the same concept like when you start looking for a new car and then ultimately buy one, almost immediately after the purchase you see your \"new\" car everywhere. It's almost like everyone owns it. Really, it's the moment you become aware of something you weren't really aware of until you started focusing on it. I didn't know what that was called, so I came up with my own word for it.\n\n"

There might be some slight differences contour shapes between the early Adobe versions and the Pro and Premium versions. The main difference is the number of extras that the newer versions contain.

The two Adobe families mentioned in the OP are Garamond Premier Pro and Adobe Garamond Pro. Adobe Garamond was one of the first Adobe Originals, designed by Robert Slimbach and released in 1989. It was later converted to OpenType and renamed Adobe Garamond Pro.\n\nGaramond Premier Pro is a completely separate Garamond revival, also by Robert Slimbach. It is less regularized (Adobe Garamond had to be designed to accommodate less powerful software and hardware of its day) and has four optical sizes. Garamond Premier Pro also has Greek and Cyrillic.\n\nThere is no \"Premium\" version. They both support CE languages, so they both have the \"Pro\" suffix.\n\n"
