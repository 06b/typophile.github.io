I did, but I'm stubborn so I finished it off after the class. Its just been sitting on my computer since then. The other day I noticed it and I kind of like it, but I'm still unsure what to make of it to be honest. What do you guys think?\n\n[http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/Jumpsuit/scalion-1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416034833/http:/i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/Jumpsuit/scalion-1.jpg \"http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/Jumpsuit/scalion-1.jpg\")\n\n",

      "content": "Interesting texture which makes a 3D effect, but you should keep the same perspective. It's not a good idea to turn the a upside down to form an e. Shorten the upper end of the t. Otherwise, an interesting typeface, no reason to ditch it. Well - I'm not quite convinced of the small bowls of p, o, g etc.\n\nAndreas\n\nPS: same problem like a/e with p and d - and I forgot to mention the m.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the feedback Andreas. You gave me flash backs. heh, this was done in illustrator and I was so tired of doing the line work the e was the last letter and I just said screw it, and flipped the a over to call it good. I agree about the bowls of the p, o, and g. If I was going to revisit (which I could depending on the feedback) I'd adjust those letters, amongst others.\n\n"
