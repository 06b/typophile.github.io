To me, it seems formal enough for business essays and articles, etc... but also adds a mild touch of unique style...\n\nBut googling Tanger Serif doesn't bring up the various reviews normally found regarding other main stream typefaces...\n\nWas curious is anyone has had any publishing/design experience with Tanger Serif... and what their opinions might be...\n\n",

AFAIK some foundries pays extra $ to get featured in the distributor's email newsletters.  \nAnother factor may be the \"news-nest\" of a font... almost nobody reviews old fonts, although there are many beautiful hidden gems. For example, this is one of those gems: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/zapf-renaissance-antiqua-sb/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140717154936/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/zapf-renaissance-antiqua-sb/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/zapf-renaissance-antiqua-sb/\")\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the comments thus far... but maybe my question was mis-worded. What I was attempting to ask was NOT 'general information' about the Tanger Serif typeface (mostly what is found is written by the designer or Typolar corporately).\n\nBut rather, my question was about how other professionals rated or viewed the typeface. To my novice eye, it is an interesting typeface with a bit of character that mainstream formal typefaces do not seem to have. I tend to like unconventional serifs such as Mamontov by omtype or in this case Tanger Serif, even for formal corporate business reports, etc.\n\nSo... with the various typography blogs out there, I haven't seen much (if any) written about Tanger Serif, and was curious why this might be. Is it due to bad design of the typeface? Or bad marketing by Typolar? Or perhaps even that design professionals tend to remain loyal to 'safe' or 'mainstream' alternatives (such as something from Adobe, Linotype, et. al.) ?\n\nHope that clarifies my question. Thanks.\n\n"

Used by everybody and their neighbor's dog's groomer in the 90s. But seriously flawed. Exhibit #2: The \"typography\" (using the term quite loosely) of Avatar. I could go on until Pangaea reforms.\n\nhhp\n\n"
