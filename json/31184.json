  "content": "I'm looking to purchase an entire font family soon. But as you all know, it's an investment. I'm torn between Scala Sans and Freight Sans. Basically, I'm looking for a family that has a wide range of applications (from text to signage). Also, which one of these fonts do you think has the best companion serif design? (I'll purchase this family in the near future) Which one is the best value for the money? Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance  \nIvan\n\n",

For example, isn't there a lot of competition for an old style serif with short ascenders? For humanist sans? Are people in love with the design? Is the completeness a key feature? Eg are people buying the all the variations?\n\n"

After trying to pair various combinations I started to look for a not too expensive family with both. I liked Freight text's italic k and r and the clean shapes of the sans. In the end it's all subjective, I just liked the font. I might not have bought all varieties had that been an option, but now I'm happy it wasn't. Still looking for an project that would give me an excuse to buy the Micro.  \nI didn't realise it was such a popular one when I bought it.\n\n"

As for Freight's popularity, these all factor in:\n\n- The sans hits all the right notes for contemporary typography: large x-height, open forms, wide, nothing too quirky but more humanist than geometric.  \n- [Darden's documentation and samples](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211617/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/shop) lend it a lot of credibility.  \n- The Micro weight is intriguing.\n\nAnd here is Freight as featured in the [QBN Typecase](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211617/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/sets/72157594511485997/) and [_Font 004_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211617/http:/www.fontshop.com/features/fontmag/004/004_contents.cfm):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211617im_/http:/typophile.com/files/376074014_9e2c847691_o_4410.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211617im_/http:/typophile.com/files/freight-in-font-magazine_3540.jpg)\n\n"

I see that having a good sans with the serif is a real plus--and I think it's pretty difficult to pull off well, so hats off to Joshua Darden.\n\nStephen, what's interesting is that your rather complete list is pretty short. By the way I'm surprised you didn't include Scala & Scala sans in your 'pairs' list, as I think this was the first one so designed and very successful, no?\n\n"
