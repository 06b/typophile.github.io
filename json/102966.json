May be they started from a hand-drawn alphabet or a [handset type](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420014655/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/vectors/handset-type), built the sentence and scaled some glyphs to increase the handwritten feeling... Whatever it is, I don't know such a type. What's the sample origin?\n\n"
