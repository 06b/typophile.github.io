I'd like to keep the typeface for my name pretty neutral (probably a geometric sans). Do you think there's a better alternative? Is overuse of a typeface a reason to reconsider using it?\n\n2. What do you think about the size of the mark in relation to the type? Currently, the weight of the type is equivalent to the weight of the M's serifs.\n\n3. Kerning good?\n\n"

I would stay with a sans face, but one with a bit more life and movement in it for my taste.  \n2. I think the mark is too large, however I don't know what you are trying to achieve and so I can only make comments based on my own prejudices & personal preference. I believe there should be a bit more of a contrast between the two elements. Both are strong and dark and the overall feel is heavy - not that this a mad thing, it could be what you want.  \n3. Letter spacing is fine.\n\n"

Is there a hard and fast rule?\n\n@Graham: For me at least, the difference in styles between the mark and type is enough contrast (a rich, curvy Bodoni vs. a simple geometric sans). I also like the fact that there is something to tie the two together (the weight of the type and the weight of the mark's serifs).\n\n@David: I will definitely try that alignment. Sounds like it will work. I'll also look at tightening up the RT.\n\n@typerror: Ideally, I'd like to have both a vertical and horizontal version of the logo, so I will be looking into both.\n\n@chris: What about the type turns you off? Any suggestions?\n\n@penn: I see these really black Bodonis with super skinny serifs all over the place. I would also worry about having the logo fall apart at small sizes if I were to thin out the serifs. I'll give it a try, though.\n\nI'll post the results of the revisions.

Frankly, the name just doesn't look at all like it belongs with the mark. I'd like to see you switch out the Gotham for something a little less conflicting.\n\n"

There's absolutely no relationship between the two, and that doesn't work for me. Seems like the unsolvable problem here is finding a way to get the two elements to come together as one. Could it be that they're repelling each other, for all or some of the reasons I mentioned above?\n\nBut, alas, I am not the authority, and surely there's some subjectivity in every critique.\n\nI can't be the only person here with this opinion.

I hope it is.\n\nThe mark is beautiful and actually looking through all the revisions you've made, I like the very first lockup version the best. Although, I can see that there are problems with the alignment and compatibility the two elements.\n\nHave you considered that maybe the mark doesn't ever need to have your name next to it? It's strong on it's own. I think you could work it out so your name never has to be part of the logo. Your letterhead, for example, could have the mark in one corner and your name with contact info along the bottom or in another corner. That will make your mark into a beautiful icon that needs no explanation. (I mean icon in the \"iconic\" sense, not as in something you would click on your computer)\n\nAlso, Gotham is a really wonderful typeface to use in your identity, but I think it would be beneficial if you experimented with others to see what happens.\n\nAnalisa\n\n"
