      "content": "I agree with Filip. The ampersand on its own is rather nice, but it doesn't quite match the overall feel of the letters. The letters have a bit of a hewn look to them — not exactly rounded, but not straight either —&nbsp;whereas the ampersand (at least in the heavier weight) is extremely rounded and softened. Interestingly, the light version captures this feel better, though it does need more openness.\n\nAll in all though it is looking nice. I especially like the glyph with the leaf.\n\n"
