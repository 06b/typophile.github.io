      "content": "Hello from Trek,\n\nAs previously asserted here on Typophile, the Trek wordmark is custom typography. It was designed by Joe Sutter, formerly of Milwaukee's Hanson Dodge + Sutter, who found inspiration in the classic Honda logotype. Having worked on the identity for our new world cup mountain bike team, I can confirm that _WORLD RACING_ is indeed set in Herb Lubalin's Avant Garde Gothic— [ITC Avant Garde Gothic Std Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031221248/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_avant_garde_gothic_by_adobe_std_book/) to be more specific.\n\nKen\n\n"
