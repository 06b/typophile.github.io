  "content": "I was wondering if anyone knew the typeface used in the West Side Story logo. Is it a true stencil font, is it an altered typeface or has it been constructed from scratch? I assume that the distressing has been done after the fact...\n\nMany thanks to all.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [west-side-story.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023194021/http:/typophile.com/files/west-side-story.jpg) | 247.38 KB |\n\n",

If so, the distressing might be genuine.  \nThe \"stencil\" lines are too thin to have been functional in a real stencil, but the designer may have added them to suggest the stencilled labels on packing crates at the docks along the Hudson River.\n\n"
