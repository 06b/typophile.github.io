I think people just wanted  \neverything faster and faster, so there was no time to draw  \nnice dropcap letters, there was no time to do something to  \nperfection...which evolved to a point where you  \ncouldn't reduce letterforms anymore and it seems,  \nnow we start saving on letters, simplify a whole  \nlanguage...but where is this going? do we simplify a  \nlanguage to a point where we're not using words any  \nlonger and just grunt at each other?\n\nsmile\n\nby the way: as a none native english speaker txt language is a pain  \nin the ass.\n\n"
