  "content": "Hey all   \n   \nI was wondering what you guys and gals use for general metrics/kerning checking.   \n   \nSeveral years ago, I used to have several text files that I used as \"contact\" sheets that I'd open and change the font to check out the spacing, metrics, kerning, etc.   \n   \nWhat do you guys (and gals) use for this -- or what \"tricks\" do you utilize for checking your metrics?   \n   \nTIA,   \nMaury\n\n",
