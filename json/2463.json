      "content": "Andrew I have a problem with the name. Cyber Camp sounds like a porno site. I think you need the word camp with cyber and a slogan that puts it in context. But that is marketing not just design. In terms of what you are working on it looks fresh and very sharp and pointy. No problems with your Cyber's\n\n"

It has just completed its 4th year,   \nso if the porno association has been made, no one has complained about it.   \n   \nWhile learning computers is certainly the focus,   \ngames and crafts are done throughout the day sessions.   \n   \nRandy, can you explain your idea further.. It sounds interesting. The wood   \nlettering is cliche, but I'm open to the idea.   \n   \nSigned,   \n   \nLost but curious\n\n"
