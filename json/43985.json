  "content": "Working on a font, & suddenly a green shadow appeared. I can move the glyph out of the way, but the green outline stays (see below). There is also a little green dot in the upper right corner of the character window.\n\nI “selected all” & moved the glyph 400 units in the picture below There was an control extra point where the “1” is, but removing it didn’t make the “green” go away. What’s going on?
