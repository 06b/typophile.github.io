Wether that be telling you directly or pointing you somewhere where that information could be found.   \n   \nThis is why people are not responding, Elithabeth. This part of the forums is for the identification of fonts, and kind members of the forums have done this for you, taking time and trouble, without payment.   \n   \nIt is not for finding illegal fonts.\n\n"
