The \"Typop\" logotype looks cool, to be sure, but I don't understand what it means either.

It seems an unnatural abbreviation, void of any reason other than arbitrariness.   \n   \nIf even we don't know what it means, how can we expect an everyday viewer to understand it? And if they don't understand it, I don't see how it would effectively communicate or promote Typophile.com.   \n   \nJust my opinion. I love the letterforms, but I don't think the design works.

For what reason, I'm not sure.   \n   \nTypop is just a clever shortening of typophile, and the 'Pop' part finds echoes in Pop Culture, Sub Pop records (nirvana's original label), Yum Pop clothing (hypercute japanese flava), and of course, Pop Tarts breakfast treats. Pop is just a cool word. It pops.   \n   \nThese are Tshirts, c'mon now.   \n   \nPeople aren't going to see a shirt with a website address printed on it and sprint to their browsers. We have a highly specialized auidence What this is more about is finding a Tshirt that \\*we\\* will REALLY ACTUALLY BUY, something we wouldn't be ashamed to wear because it is, for lack of a better word, cool.

Having a contest like this, as some kind of annual contest that provides Bandwith Revenue, will ensure that Typophile is around for a long time.   \n   \nEverybody wants that.   \n   \nI don't know if the judges have a mandate, but I hope that they pick a 'cool' design that typophiles will buy as opposed to an obscure design that people hate.   \n   \nWho wouldn't want that?   \n   \nMaybe we have different ideas of what the term 'cool' means. I don't mean 'trendy' or 'lowest-common denominator', I mean something people, us, would BUY. Maybe the word 'appealing' is better. (retro-strategizing® the use of the trite word 'cool')   \n   \n\\>\\>Tanya: This contest offers a unique opportunity to create something for a specific market.   \n   \nExactly. Design with a purpose. Consider your audience. Because it's a contest, consider your judges. And consider the utility that your design will provide. So, somebody, anybody, knock off the current favorite designs with something amazing, something typopgraphic, something that won't need retro-strategized® in the morning.   \n   \nbj\n\n"

As long as the design has a good concept behind it, catches somebody's eye and springs curiosity the person will come to visit this site and maybe buy a shirt whether the shirt spells Typophile, Typop, Typhopile, Typhileop, etc...\n\n"

If you mean conversation at the workplace (where it can be presumed that other people are also interested in fonts), then you don't need a shirt - you just tell the guy about Typophile when you get a chance.   \n   \nIn general, you see a cool shirt, it motivates you to remember it, and perhaps soon do something about it. Like visit the friggin' site!

If you don't like the fact that nobody has commented positively on your designs, then do something better. It seems that you are trying to harm the process, a process that doesn't care much for the designs you have submitted. Are the two related?   \n   \nDo you care about Typophile, specifically, or is this 'just another forum' to you?   \n   \nYou should care. You are the most prolific Typophile here. Millions of pixels owe their life to you.   \n   \nit's simple, this site needs funds to survive. they get thousands of hits. that eats bandwith. that costs money. they are NOT putting money in their pockets. their putting money in their IP's pockets. Of course they want new people to come. Do you really believe otherwise?   \n   \nIf you want to try to hyperanalyze every pixel and find sinister motives, then that's your choice. That's what these forums are for. But don't forget what you always talk about: consequences of behavior.   \n   \nI know I could never expect to get a last word in, so I'm going to go have fun today. fyi, it's nice today in our neck of the city. maybe i'll see you at the park.   \n   \nbj\n\n"

I am working on several designs for this competition. I hope to win like everyone else. The money could come in handy too.   \nI disagree with Tim Lee who said whoever wins is not that important. Why should some one enter this competition. I saw all the designs. Some people don't care it seems if they win or lose. I would have put the names on thse inital posts. That way you would have more quality over quantity. People wouldnt put their name on some of the designs. I dont exactly know how to capture the essence of typophile. Its a forum to discuss type and design. There are a lot of those on the internet. I'm unsure about what the judges are looking for. Some of them are type designers so the type should be topnotch. NOt Arial or Times. I agree with Joe Pemberton that putting a dot com on a shirt (like www.dotcom.com) is so \"three years ago\" Every one three years ago was proudly wearing their dot bomb shirts on casual Fridays and weekends. It was a big joke if you ask me. People walking into the grocery store wearing their dot bomb shirts. It was like showing off. Now you wouldnt be caught dead wearing a dot bomb shirt. As for people visiting the site. I don't think non-designers give a whip. But every designer should at least stop by. That would be my target demographic. Especially a lot of these web designers who track Arial or Helvetica tight and think that is design. Then if you are at a party with other web designers then I would wear it. If it was a party with the regular population I wouldn't wear it. I think if the winning design is reeeeeely good then people would approach and say nice shirt buddy but I dont think theyd pull out a pen and write down www.typophile.com and then get home and check it out first thing. Thats a stretch. I think peoplemake fun of any shirt now that says www.something.com. Do I haaaaave to do that I look foward to seeing my designs posted. It seems like theres a huge backlog.   \n   \nciao,   \n   \ndave\n\n"
