  "content": "Hi,\n\nI would like your opinion on what's \"the best\" lightning strike font around. By lightning strike I mean very angular, electrocuted letters, mimicking the movement of a lightning. Think 70's disco music or 00's \"electro clash\" record sleeves...they use this style a lot, but I was unable to find something as of yet.\n\nThank you so much! BTW, this site rules.\n\nHave a nice day,  \nGeleon\n\n",
