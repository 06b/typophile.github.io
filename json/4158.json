In all caps text (when no small caps is avail.) or in \"uppercase\" numbers, it's either too high or too low if the pt size is less than say, 9ish. Is there a setting somewhere? (I'm currently using com-opt-shift-+/- for individual baseline shifting.)   \n   \nIn the picture, the numbers range from 6 pt to 13 pt, with the left setting at the unchanged height, and the right hyphen only one bump up.   \n   \nDoes InDesign do baseline shifting in basically the same way as Illustrator?   \n   \n ![hyphen comparison](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051100im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/32813.gif)   \n   \nThanks!\n\n",

You can raise and lower any character in less than one point increments by opening up the Character Attributes dialog box and entering the fraction in the proper slot.   \n   \nYou can call up the dialog box either by dragging down to Baseline Shift from the \"Style\" menu or use the keyboard shortcut (command-shift-D) on Macs.

      "content": "I often have to set an ISBN number, which I'm pretty sure should use regular hyphens. (?)   \nDoes Bringhurst say \"(ie, the minus)\"? I think at one point he mentioned the minus generally being slightly wider than a hyphen. He probably gives the percentage of an em that it is. I was using a font awhile back that I couldn't find a real minus sign for, so I kerned two hyphens together (not sure if that was the best thing to do, but it looked right). The shorter hyphen is especially noticeable if you put a minus sign next to a plus sign. -+   \nAlso, although he suggests shortened ens to set off words.. I was wondering.. is that more of a British thing? He called using unspaced ems \"victorian\" but.. well.. I like them better! The spaces seem like they draw too much attention. (?)   \nA few questions in there, if I'm lucky someone can answer all of them.   \n   \n\\>\\> Kristin, that's exactly what I was looking for. Command shift D... got it!   \n   \nThanks again!\n\n"

      "content": "Brian --   \n   \nISBNs are generally set with hyphens, just as phone numbers and other strings like that. I generally track them open a few percent, to make the number string more readable.   \n   \nThe minus is generally very similar in length to the en dash. The main difference is that the vertical alignment of the minus is on par with the other mathematical operators and the figure style -- i.e., raised higher for lining numerals.   \n   \nIf you need to create a minus for use with a typeface that does not have one, you're better off modifying an en dash (scaling horizontally to achieve the proper visual length and baseline adjusting to get the proper alignment) than you are kerning two hyphens. The primary reason for this suggestion is that the hyphen in many typefaces is not always a purely horizontal stroke, whereas the en dash almost invariably is. Also, you can set your modifications of the en dash into a character style to easily apply repeatedly, whereas the hyphen kerning will have to be done manually on an ad hoc basis.   \n   \nBringhurst presents a very solid set of well-thought-out guidelines; however, he is not god. Some things should be taken with a grain of salt.   \n   \nBringhurst's recommendation of spaced en dashes is a mostly British convention (or possibly European, on the whole). It is, however, very unusual to American eyes -- and completely unacceptable to many American editors and publishers.   \n   \nMoreover, I believe the debate about closed or open setting of em dashes continues to simmer in American editorial circles, much like the age-old debate about the serial comma. The current convention seems to lean toward closed. On the other hand, I happen to work often with a publisher whose style is open.   \n   \nI personally prefer a compromise of thin spaces fore and aft.   \n   \nAll of these dash questions were considered when I designed my Whitman typeface. You can read more about this on pages 18 & 19 of the Whitman specimen, available as a PDF at [www.kentlew.com/Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051100/http:/www.kentlew.com/Type/).   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>recommendation of spaced en dashes   \n   \nIIRC Bringhurst says the em was a Victorian innovation, like bold type. Both he thinks are generally a violation of even color, and certainly not to his classical tastes.   \n   \nPersonally, I think the British convention that Bringhurst prefers has a more even look on the page. Nathan Matteson suggested to me in a critique that it is best to thin space the en dash. This did seem better - I think maybe it doesn't stretch with justification the way the word space does.   \n   \nWhat do you think of the en dash with thin spaces idea?\n\n"

      "content": "William --   \n   \nI think that spaced en dashes introduce as much, if not more, air into the line as em dashes. Think about it: assuming a 250 unit space, you get 250 + 500 + 250 = 1000 units width (the equivalent of a traditional em dash) with the disadvantage of half of that being pure air.   \n   \nYes, the counter argument is that often the space may be less than 250. But I remain unpersuaded.   \n   \nWith thin spaces, the en dash is completely insufficient to do the job required. Most uses for which the em dash is employed have the quality of a break in thought, whether for amplification, parenthetical comment, or enumeration. As such, the function is to separate.   \n   \nThe en dash, on the other hand, is generally used to show a connection between a range of numbers.   \n   \nThe en dash is a connector; the em dash is a separator.   \n   \nIn fact, the most common argument against the closed setting of em dashes is that it seems to connect that which it is supposed to separate. The opposite camp maintains that open setting introduces too much air.   \n   \nI agree with both positions, hence my preference for the compromise.   \n   \nAnd, in fact, I do prefer an em dash which is not the full traditional em -- more like a three-quarter em dash, actually. Some contemporary fonts are beginning to use these instead of a full em. Matthew Carter, for instance, has placed an em dash of ~780 in Miller and Fenway, for instance. These also include a hair space built in to the sidebearings. Following his lead, I designed the em dash in Whitman at 800, similarly hair-spaced.   \n   \nI think this is a better solution than Bringhurst's (with all due respect).   \n   \nFor typefaces that do not include these niceties, I once described a workaround in Quark for Cheshire Dave (here on Typophile, I'm pretty sure). It involves defining the flex space to operate as a thin/hair space and creating a character style which scales the dash to 75-80%. With these two elements, one can then search and replace and convert an entire document easily. (I'm sure something similar could be done in InDesign.) You can search for the thread for more detail, if you're interested. If you can't find it (and if this summary isn't complete enough to give you the idea), then I could probably be persuaded to repeat my instructions.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

Ever since I read it in Bringhurst, and looked again a page, the em dashes have stood out like sore thumbs. There just isn't anything on that scale in the type, so it is disruptive in my opinion.\n\n"
