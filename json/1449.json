I only regret not being able to be in three places at once for some of those presentations. I really wanted to see more. That's probably the best complaint they can get.   \n   \nThe food, well... I guess I understand now why I've never heard of one going out to a Canadian restaurant. I preferred Leipzig. If I weren't allergic to seafood, I might have enjoyed the food more.   \n   \nSo now that it's Monday, check out the announcement from [Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516140949/http:/www.adobe.com/).\n\n"

I'm naturally shy and intimidated by crowds, and I find it very difficult to walk up to people and say: \"Hi! Who are you?\" I would have liked to have met more people from the on-line forums ... oh, well. Next time.   \n   \nFor me, the best talk was the Kevin Larson/Gerald Unger combination re: Word Recognition & Legibility. Lots of good information, I'm just sorry hhp wasn't there to cross swords w/ Kevin :o) I also thought the font business series was good.   \n   \nVancouver is beautiful, and the weather was fantastic. It was very difficult to stay indoors; more than once I was tempted to steal a sailboat, head West & keep on going.\n\n"

Over sushi with Cyrus, I was complaining (as is my wont) of the stale state of typography in mass market magazines available at airports, but mentioned that there was one exception, but I couldn't remember the magazine name or identify the headline font, so I drew him a couple of characters. \"Oh, was that Natural Health?\" says Cyrus, \"That's the first issue and a new face I just designed.\"   \n   \n6. Best quote? \"The choice of type is based on reputation and trends, rather than any kind of logic.\" - Roger Black\n\n"

It's a nightmere.   \n   \nThough I still do my presentations in InDesign and present in Acrobat. That's what I did for mine at ATypI. Can't do without the typographic sophistication. No kerning?

However, if you have Acrobat 6 Pro, you can export PDF from PowerPoint and have it even map transitions to their closest PDF equivalents. I haven't played with this much, since I think fancy transitions are often a distraction, so I can't say how well it works.   \n   \nKeith:   \nI agree wholeheartedly that PowerPoint is great for managing structured presentations. That's why I still use it even though the typography sucks so badly.
