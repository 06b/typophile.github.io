Amongst the stack are some groovtastic Computer Arts Project mags, one of which is CA's 100th birthday issue. The issue celebrates iconic pieces of graphic design. And there it was - an unwittingly cold cruel typo...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022148im_/http:/typophile.com/files/milton_gi_aser_5809.png)\n\n...and in Milton's own stencil font too :(\n\nEither that, or there really is an iconic graphic designer named MILTON GI ASER.\n\n",

The evil thing was seen only for a short while before being yanked and corrected long before going to press. I didn't know there were two 'a's in national - but I do now!\n\n"
