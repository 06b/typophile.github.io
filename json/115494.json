  "content": "My headline is in Engravers MT (not Gothic, St, Regular or Roman, etc.). I would greatly appreciate a suggestion for a full bodied, serif font that would allow me a full paragraph and several weights in sentence case that could substitute out this font. Engravers MT offers lovely, distinguished, old-fashioned serifs that create a vintage feel. I have found Narziss and Promotor, but I think one or two of these are free and have no varying weights, which is key.\n\n",
