I didn't have any clear idea or sketches before i started, i just sat down and started drawing beziers.\n\nAs you can see, there's no metrics or kerning to speak of yet, and the hinting is horrible, frankly because i don't know how to do that stuff yet! First of all i wanted to get some feedback on the character widths and the general design of letters. Are there any letters horribly out of sync with the rest, that are too skinny/thick, etc.\n\nIf you have anything else to add, go ahead! Any and all insights will help!\n\nOoh, also, would it be correct to label this a neo-grotesk? That's just my uneducated guess. :)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [yellow\\_sample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043929/http:/typophile.com/files/yellow_sample.pdf) | 39.37 KB |\n\n",
