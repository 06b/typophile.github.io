  "content": "Hi,  \nPlease, can anbody update or correct my memory:  \nI faintly remember having read that in acient times among printers there was the tradition that up to three errors in a book would be regarded as \"okay\". The nickname for an error was \"turtle\" or, since I think the story took place in Italy, \"tartaruga\". Therefore a printer created his mark showing two turtles so that in the rest of the book only one more turtle (= mistake) could be expected. In doing so he referred to his superior quality.  \nI cannot find this story on the web. Is my memory wrong? Has anybody heard of a similar story? Thanks in advance for helpful suggestions!\n\n",

If the printer found the errors prior to printing, why wouldn't he fix them? Or is this mark just used in advertising the book?\n\n"

That would be \"Printer's Errors,\" not \"mistakes.\" Author's make mistakes.\n\nI wonder if the practice of reprinting with greater than three errors applied only to books where a page took up a single leaf? Or was it extended to editions with folded pages -- folios, quartos, even octavos?\n\nAnd what if additional errors were discovered after some customers had already purchased the sheets & paid an illustrator to draw in any drop-in letters? Or worse, taken the sheets to his favorite binder? The printer couldn't just supply a fresh \"page,\" then.\n\nI sense a curious story, but not universal...\n\n"

It turns out that Aldus Manutilus really used the _same typeface_ for De Aetna and the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, except that for the latter the _capital letters_ were replaced with a new set.\n\nThat suggests that someone might attempt a revival that, instead of being two separate typefaces, like Bembo and Poliphilus, respectively, might be two versions of the same typeface, with different upper-case letters only.\n\n"
