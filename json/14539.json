You can discover much about shape, line quality, balance, composition, contrast, materials and techniques from life drawing. All of this is acutely relevant to graphic design. I recommend it to anyone who spends too much time on the computer. You can do it at home if you have a lazy partner, roommate, dog or child, though instruction helps a lot.\n\nHand skills work well in combination with digital tools.

The illustrator side of me always draws everything I do FIRST on paper, before I ever touch the computer. Doing this first really helps me see the big picture before I start doing the fine details. I think many designers use the computer \"only\" which I think can really limit creativity. This is not to say that everyone is the same, there are many desginers who can go straight to the computer...but as a recent student myself, I've seen quite a bit of the former.\n\nDavid's onto something too, while I don't think its completely necessary to follow the drawing exercises-studying the typefaces is certainly a good idea. Designing with Type by James Craig or Elements of Typographic Style by Bringhurst might be good places to start learning. I also can't stress life/figure drawing classes enough. This will also teach you a lot about form.\n\n"

Our first day in art school lettering involved \"sidling\" a lower case \"f\" in Franklin Gothic from our type books through parchment paper with a soft pencil. Of course, few passed the test because we were all lunkheads incapable of seeing the delicate ambiance of the font. This seems like necessary work to learn type, but it seems unnecessary to prepare a comp with the availability of computers. Clients understand finished comps much better than sketching. This reminds me of an illustrator I once met who refused to give up marker comps; destined to be left behind because he only used his computer for billing.\n\nSDK  \nSusan Kirkland  \nSDKirkland Master Designer  \nAuthor of  \nStart & Run a Creative Services Business ISBN 155180607X  \nView my work and excerpts from the book (click the book icon) at\n\n"

Frankly, I would have loved to go to one of these schools where they teach current methods at all, let alone to the exclusion of ancient methods. My teachers made us do a pile of thumbnails, a rough half-size marker comp, a tight half-size marker comp, a tight full-size marker comp that looks exactly the same as the tight half-size marker comp because all the demanded changes have been made already, and then for the final comp we had to spec type on film negative to make rub-on transfers with an accursed Omnicrom toaster thing. I once chose Kabel Extra Bold for a headline solely because I knew I was expected to cut 24pt letters out of colored paper with a blade. This was in the 1990s, when all design jobs were already advertised entirely in terms of what software you knew. You can see why I never became a fixture of the industry.\n\n"

I think there are several kinds of drawing going on here.\n\n“Building up” refers to a technique letterers would  \nuse in which they first drew a stick outline of the shape,  \nthen proceeded to color or “build up” the letter until  \nthe form matured.\"\n\nThis is from the old days and no one does it much anymore because the accuracy of the result is so distant from the type that really happens, that it's useless. I tell young designers and old ones too, that type sketche, even the really nice ones on napkins, are about the same worth: draw it for real if you're gonna take that much time, or buy the damn typeface for a fraction of the cost of drawing even one headline...\n\nAnother letterdrawing is all and only about the contour, so there is no \"build up.\" The letterdrawer concentrates all of her efforts on the contour by shifting back and forth on the two sides of the paper, using a light table to compare the results, erasing and shaving until the form is PerFect, all on one side or the other, and then transferring the contour to its final place and filling in a separate operation.\n\nAlso, watch your wrist! I learned as a child, to draw tiny little segments of lines in a nervous motion, rotating the paper for the optimal angle and generally using the hand as a stationary compass attached to the wrist. Then, I went to Aaahhrt School, and they unlearned me from this, teaching me that the wrist should be free! and the paper should be bound. This is fine for nak'd body drawing, but since very few people are shaped like letters...Well, then I went Linotype, and learned that my child'ood method was what was required, except, with a light table you can use both sides of the paper.\n\nEven later, Ed B. Nuts taught me that due to the need to prove to skeptical people that you do in fact have a job, you'd better also learn to make credible letters with a fork, on a napkin or table cloth. This too has served me well, and works especially nicely with a smaller, 3-tined salad fork, a padded table with a nice white cloth.\n\n"

For me, \"sketching\" and \"drawing\" are two completely different experiences, or areas of engaged processing.\n\n_Sketching_ is more like brainstorming by eye & hand.  \nIn some instances I have a concept in my mind's eye that I need to materialize on paper or screen in order to expand, refine or reject.  \nIn other instances, my hand is governed by no preconception and is allowed to freely explore, wander, and conjur hoping that it triggers visual clues to explore, teasing ideas out of the subconcious.\n\n_Drawing_, by my own discipline, is setting aside the \"mind\" and letting the EYE guide what my hand should follow. Looking, looking, drawing, erasing, looking and drawing... in this way my mind develops an awareness of shape, form, and space by witnessing this process. One of my drawing teachers always told us to draw the _other side_ of the figure or apple, the part unseen. This was hard to fathom at first (and even harder to draw once you understood). But eventually you begin to _see_ not what your mind tells you, but subtleties that only your eyes can pick up.\n\nSo, for me, I can _draw_ a typeface by observation, and can _sketch_ an idea for review.\n\n"
