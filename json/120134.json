Actually I found the exact one but this freebie was blatantly close to Refreshment Stand, I took the conclusion to consider it as an illegal rip-off. That's why I decided to silence the match name and to credit Refreshment Stand for being the source of your sample.  \nTop the rip-off freebie, bottom Refreshment Stand with main difference for your sample is /o-/m connection.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141005160422im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_3961.png)\n\n"
