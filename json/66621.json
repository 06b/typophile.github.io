  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am looking for Western-style typefaces that are not the typical saloon-hot-iron-brand typefaces. These typefaces will be used to design a contemporary magazine advertisement with a Western-style flare.\n\nHere are a few examples of what I like so far,\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/applewood/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106221240/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/applewood/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/applewood/\")  \n [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/device/chase/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106221240/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/device/chase/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/device/chase/\")  \n [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106221240/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/\")\n\nAny research help, or advice about using these or other Western-style typefaces together, is greatly appreciated.\n\n- corey\n\n",

You seem to like the distressed woodtype variety. I would just search woodtype at Myfonts.com and see what comes up.\n\nMaple doesn't scream western, but it has a certain flavor:  \n [http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106221240/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/index.html \"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/index.html\")\n\nLetterhead fonts has some nice display faces. Font Mesa also has a few.\n\nGood Luck!\n\npbc\n\n"
