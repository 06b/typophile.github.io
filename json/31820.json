The image isn't very good, and even at 150% of the original size it's hard to see details (I tried tweaking contrast etc but that's about the best I could get), but I think there's more than enough there for a first appraisal.\n\nIt would be great to see other samples from around the world.

      "content": "Well, I can comment on my recent redesign of my school's monthly paper. I ended up using Mercury Text Grade 2 for the body text (and Farnham Display for the headlines). Being a novice at news design and having just read Bringhurst, I decided to make the body text 9 pt on 11 pts leading. When I hear about news design nowadays, I often hear of much tighter spacing, usually between .5 pt to 1 pt.\n\nAlthough my choice of 9 on 11 might have diminished our ability to put enough words on the page, it ultimately ended up to our benefit. The reason is that the generous leading significantly lightens the typographic color of the page, so publishing a page of largely text, without many subheads, graphics, pull quotes, etc. to break up the gray monotony (which is usually condemned as being intimidating) ends up not feeling too oppressive. So ultimately I've been happy with my decision -- I think that it's ultimately made the paper more accessible to flighty student readers.\n\n"

There has been a general brightening up of the pages with lighter type, larger type, and wider columns in the redesigns. Ragged setting is used more, generally on opinion, rather than news.\n\nKerning is all by machine, but the machines are getting better. I know most people here would consider it attrocious, but compared to what it was in the past.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe best story about newspaper typography came in the early days of computerized typesetting, on a paper using a proprietary system, I think.

      "content": "Erik, etc\n\nYour scanned sample is interesting. Much more 'magazine- like' to my Australian eye – tight leading, very condensed, wide column. Even though I dont read Spanish(?), I find it a little difficult for my eyes to just flow through. If I wanted to read 'all' the content I might find it a little difficult, but if I was just 'scanning' the information it would probably be OK, or even very easy.\n\nThe development of newspaper typography/layout, is always an intriguing one. As always there are cultura, media and technical considerations.\n\nMy observation of newspaper design in Australia and to some extent in Western Europe and the US over the last 20 years is that if proprietors or editorial administration have 'commercial' or 'branding' interests, as well as funds, there will be onging considerations of their publication’s design. There will be thoughts about typographic fashion, concerns for a fresh style, or perhaps fine-tuning of an expected look for a particular publication. Even publications which are intended to appear conservative and so relatively unchanging (eg. the traditional dense look of 'The New York Times', the slightly fresher style of the UKs 'Guardian') have ongoing typographic 'tweaks'.\n\nIn Sydney, The broadsheet 'Sydney Morning Herald' has had ongoing makeovers in the past couple of decades – in part, because of the where digital design could allow quicker production by less staff. The first change I really noticed was relatively subtle with introduction of sans-serf headlines and a dense high x-height serif setting of the text. I'm not sure, but I think the designer borrowed some of the look of what was then newly designed Guardian as well as what was happening in some more progressive US newspapers. The new look allowed for more hyphenations (automatic!) to fit text in traditionally small columns (and so less white rivers) and there was a little more white space around images, etc. This is where the 'design' would have been discussed with 'editorial' staff. I think they also introduced a slightly whiter paper to aid in image contrast. Some time around 2000 the look was modified with a new set of similar but different text fonts, a more dramatic titling font, and wider columns – all intended to be more readable for a general audience that were developing better skills in interepreting layouts and interesting looking fonts (largely an influence of our 'magazine' culture I suppose). There have since been some ongoing (degenerative?) changes.\n\nThere are a couple of independent Australian design companies that specialise in editorial designs (ie. magazine, newspaper). One is de Luxe and Associates. James de Vries and his team have done some good solid work over the years with mostly Australian and Asian publications. They consider overrall design, including who will be setting the publications and how effectively the proposed design can be maintained, or developed. If anyone is interested their site has some interesting comments within their Editorial \\> Neswpaper project samples:\n\nA sample of a site comment is:\n\nProject: FPC Couriers  \n“Mid-2006, we undertook one of our most ambitious projects yet – to redesign an entire suite of local newspapers. As well as the six existing titles, we also had to accommodate a “footprint restructure” and evolution of new titles.  \nOnce the designs were completed and the processes behind them fully realised, they were then implemented across multiple offices, each with their own different set of staff and requirements. Once this was achieved, staff (including editors) were briefed and trained, with early issues monitored to iron out any wrinkles.”\n\nCheers. Graham\n\n"

Still, it is far from perfect. I know newspapers in general have to grapple with space issues, but Folha is often guilty of excessive negative tracking.\n\nI recall reading something you (Hrant) wrote somewhere about a newspaper face that you found too humanistic. Would you care to expand on that a little?\n\nMost Brazilian typographers (an extremely rare species) and pseudo-typographers seem to be ignorant of text faces that are not romantic or romantic-leaning post-moderns (or Times Roman, of course). This affects a lot of books and almost all newspapers printed in Brazil.\n\nWhile I realize there don't seem to be a whole lot of newspapers out there using radically different typefaces from the ones commonly found in this country, I for one would be glad to see a little more humanism in newspaper and especially book typography in Brazil. But perhaps you have convincing arguments as to why Brazilian newspapers could be going in the right direction.\n\n"

      "content": "OK Erik, sorry about not picking up the text sample as Portuguese – I was in my scanning mode. My initial 'abstract' reaction was that the font and setting had an Italian, Spanish or French feel.\n\nAs far as a day-to-day appreciation of newspapers, I usually take a glance at the design then just move on and read the thing. Following my initial comments on the Sydney Morning Herald, I had a good look at it over the last couple of days and realised that the design had in fact changed over the last year. And to a designer's eye not for the better. There is apparently a new editor with new ideas. Maybe his changes are considered better from a 'branding' or 'reader-appreciation' viewpoint. Heads have now reverted from the sans serif, Interstate, which I had liked, to the serif, Minion, which makes it all very ordinary. Charter has been maintained as the text font, though set without apparent logic as either justified or ragged (depending on who is setting it I think).\n\nI spoke to my friend James de Vries about his own recollection of the design development of the SMH, and as it turns out, it was actually his company that did the redesign in 2000. He is disappointed that his original designs have not been maintained or built on. Following some public debate about the new design in 2000, some adjustments within the first weeks of publication included an increase in the text size from 8.8pt to 9.2pt. His site is [www.de-luxe.com.au](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017170747/http:/www.de-luxe.com.au/ \"www.de-luxe.com.au\"). He also mentioned a current design project where he has commissioned Christian Schwartz in NY to work on a family of serif and sans serif fonts – modifications of some existing ones I think.\n\nCustom type action in Australia? From my perspective, not much goes on at all. There is always someone fiddling with existing fonts and a couple of collectives that 'pull a few faces', then they just slip away. A few names that come to mind... Australian Type Foundry, Jack Yan, Letterbox / Stephen Banham. Very few (if any) hard driving font designers.\n\n"

Do PDFs ever shove letter spacing around like that? Does even any layout program? That one baffles me.\n\nIf you are interested in samples, FontBureau is a leading supplier of fonts to newspapers (including in Latin America) and they have samples of their newspaper fonts on newsprint, which I'm sure they will send you on request.\n\nAlso typophiler Nick Shinn has designed a number of newspaper fonts and I'm sure would respond to a request for samples.\n\n"

It must be some out of whack justification software or defective version of the font or something. I'd like to know just to avoid it ever happening to me! Any ideas out there?\n\n"
