My guess is that this is actually derived from Rotis Serif to begin with. Note the balled ends of the ’a’, ’r’ and ’c’, it would be much more difficult to add these to Rotis SemiSerif than to simply remove the serifs at the bottoms of the serifed characters. Beyond that the charactes have been squashed vertically with the curves of the ’a’ and ’c’ having been completely redrawn. I also suspect a stroke has been added to the arms of the capital ’T’. You can see what I’m yapping about visually below.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014011015im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tarmac_4602.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "No problem. ;^)\n\nThe suffix STD only means it’s a Standard OpenType face, a typeface with a limited character set that doesn’t take advantage of advanced OpenType features. That’s purely technological and has nothing to do with the design. The suffix Pro stands for ’fat’ OpenType faces with extended character sets, like small caps, contextual ligatures, Eastern European accents, Cyrillic, Greek and so on. Read more about it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014011015/http:/www.fontshop.com/support/opentype.php/).\n\nPretty sure it’s a custom designed logo inspired by Rotis SemiSerif.\n\n"
