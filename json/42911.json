First, the ideas that students think are great are often things that people with the technical skills have had, and realized are flawed.\n\nSecondly, if you could make money with ideas (and not the execution of them) I would be a rich man.\n\nLearn the technical skills, and then the ideas can be realized, and you will discover the many that don’t work, and can start to build your reputation with the few that do.\n\n"

I have immense creativity when it comes to ideas but lack execution skill. I am a student and can not pay a professional photographer to take great pictures or actually make a product because of not being able to mould a product out of plastic etc. What happens then? There are certain restrictions being a student.\n\n"

Most designers don’t do their own illustration, or photography, or molding of plastic packages; they pay productions specialists to do it. For school projects, don’t try to do that stuff—do other stuff instead. When I want great photos, I scan them or use stock, when I have to design a package I reuse existing components. But I don’t worry about ideas that I can’t produce—I just think of something else instead.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>Isnt that bad using someone elses photographs?</cite>\n\nNot at all. A graphic designer’s job is to communicate by bringing various sensory elements together in a way that works technically and aesthetically. Nobody expects a designer to do her own photography—after all, just getting good at one area of photography can take years, much less being able to photograph everything from still life to portrait to urban architecture. If I wanted to do really great outdoor photography in downtown DC the camera alone would cost me tens of thousands of dollars and I wouldn’t even know how to use it—so using other people’s work is the only option!\n\nThere are plenty of photographers who understand this and post their work on sites like Flickr and sxc.hu just for student (and low-budget) designers to use. And in most countries there are “fair use” exceptions in copyright law that allow students to use other works for non-commercial purposes.\n\nIn the commercial world, all these specialists are pretty well compensated for their work. They also often get credit (ever notice the name of the photographer alongside an image) or get paid extra to leave their name off the work. So it’s really a win-win situation.\n\n"
