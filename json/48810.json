  "content": "Call me crazy, but somehow, 'Engravers Gothic' ended up in my type library, and I can't remember ever putting it there. Does this come with the Mac OS? Was it installed with Adobe Creative Suite? Or some other software? Just curious if anyone else has an explanation. Also, in Linotype Font Explorer, \"Engravers 2\" appears as the Font Family name. But individual font weights are called \"AT Sackers Gothic\". Any explanation for what that's all about?\n\nThanks!\n\nDanny\n\n",
