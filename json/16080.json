His first avocation was history, which may well explain his love of classical letterforms, historically significant typefaces and fuddy-duddy typography in general. He did however spend a lifetime in technically advanced reference publishing. In retirement, he decided to spend his next life as a type designer. His type designs, both text faces and display fonts, are distributed worldwide by several independent type foundries. He has been happily married to the same woman since 1964, lives outside Stockholm, Sweden, and has two daughters and a grandson. His atypical interests are history, small arms, photography and hiking in the mountains of Lapland.\n\n(info from [Fountain](http://web.archive.org/web/20140411195951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fountain) website)\n\n",
