We here, at astroluxtype shout a resounding yes!\n\nSure, you can find the apex of fine font design that will have your mind and eyes burst with joy at the level of sophistication and craftsmanship they exhibit- Koo Koo Puff Condensed and Light Condensed are not one of those fonts. But if kooky goofy is your thing, we're selling it at the astroluxtype booth.\n\nKoo Koo Puff Light Condensed is the companion font to Koo Koo Puff Regular Condensed. Both fonts includes an upper and lowercase glyph set. It has a different upper and lowercase “O” from the original Koo Koo Puff Regular Condensed. Spacing metrics are looser, as well. The font is not a match for Regular Condensed, it is a separate font. Both are headline display faces, for optimum usage it is recommended, not be set smaller than 48 points in size.\n\nLook to astroluxtype’s Sugarbang! as the first in a series of fonts inspired by vintage product packaging, Koo Koo Puff is the second release in the Cerealboxx series. The third font is in the fridge getting cool now, watch for it in the future.
