This could take up to a full day or more.\n\nThis maintenance was not for fixing bugs or addressing feature issues - and yes we are aware of the problems you listed above and are working towards solutions. We were simply upgrading to a faster server - which was supposed to take 30 minutes but our lovely friends at MediaTemple decided it should take much, much longer.\n\nThanks\n\n"

      "content": "What's with messing with the URL structure? It appears that the /cms/ thing is perhaps a staging area? I hope so, because if you thought that your Google indexing was bad before, wait until your entire site is de-indexed. Automated 302 redirects are helpful, and if the move is permanent, full 301 redirects are essential.\n\nAs a side note, if the /cms/ change isn't a staging area for the server transfers, it's a poor URL design structure that does little to help the end user. A URL re-write could be used to make things more user, and SEO, friendly.\n\nJust some thoughts, in any case. Take them for what you will.\n\n"
