  "content": "I am designing a logotype for a firm that plan to arrange theme dinners held in various spectacular places. Examples of food could be 'scandinavian' or '18th century menus'. Examples of places could be an old castle or a closed-down railway station.   \n   \nSo the arrangements will have a 'adventurous' quality. Therefore the design elements of the identity (fonts, colour, symbols) must have a hint of exotic places, third world, globetrotter, unexplored land ... you know ...   \n   \nI know what colours to choose from and what symbols and patterns. But do any of you know a font with the desired exotic quality to it?   \n   \n--   \nSoren O\n\n",

      "content": "I'm wondering if -- assuming these are high end affairs -- that maybe you should brand it as high brow rather than exotic. There is a restaurant chain called [Rainforest Cafe](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307105049/http:/www.rainforestcafe.com/) that attempts to provide an exotic ambience by pretending to be a jungle or rainforest. Your client sounds a lot cooler, but I wonder if trying to find exotic fonts will take you down the same cheesy road that Rainforest Cafe did. Good luck!\n\n"
