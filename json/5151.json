An example is the end-of-line \"e\" which had a long extension below the crossbar. Remember, letter and word spacing was done by eye and on the fly; sometimes the end of a line came unexpectedly so little tricks and alternate letterforms came about to save the day. Later these variants became normal and sometimes could be used to distinguish individual hands.\n\n"

I made some illustrations for what they might be worth.   \n   \nA browse through some calligraphy instruction manuals show pretty consistent construction (I'm not a calligrapher but the books had letters in them...):   \n   \n ![letter construction](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826124347im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/37065.jpg)   \n   \nHere's a detail from an illustration in Fairbank's _A Handwriting Manual_:   \n   \n ![mercator detail](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826124347im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/37066.jpg)   \n   \nThe highlight box shows typical construction of ss, ct, and st ligatures. Of note, but not highlighted is the flourished st ligature above the highlight box in the word 'est'.   \n   \nFairbanks asserts that 'Joins are undoubtedly agents of speed'. This seems logical in the italic hand but here is an example of the ct and ss ligatures in use in a book hand (Fairbanks, Plate 2 detail):   \n   \n ![psalter detail](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826124347im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/37067.jpg)   \n   \nI guess it would preserve speed here too, though it looks as though there is no pretense at flourish or decoration here.   \n   \nI noticed (but did not scan) the text in Morison's _Letter Forms_ which is set in Digital Fournier. The ct and st ligatures have lost most (not all) of their chirographic thick and thin and seem to be more sculpted into the serif on the c and s and into the top of the t (as contrasted with the lower left highlight in the last Psalter example).   \n   \n_...sometimes the end of a line came unexpectedly so little tricks and alternate letterforms came about to save the day_   \n   \nWhich is true and many letters that don't have crossbars end up with crossbars or a horizontal exit bar when this happens like the lc n occuring at the end of a line that needs justification to the one preceding.   \n   \nI hope any of this is useful.   \n   \nJon\n\n"

Although in the Camp method, instead of a loop to the top of the stem I guess you'd just get a continuation into the bar - which however I have never noticed happen.   \n   \nThe Mercator ligation seems a bit mannered, no? It makes me think that, yes, the original motivation was chirographic facilitation, but then formal sensibilities kicked in. This, even though you're right in alluding to the fact that slanted/cursive writing is faster/less\\_formal. But the Psalter sample is much more sobre, and it still have ligation, albeit logically more reserved instances.   \n   \n\\> Morison's _Letter Forms_ .... more sculpted   \n   \nAnd to me those thin joins are awkward and distracting; sort of like the \"perfect\"-circle OS zero.   \n   \n--   \n   \nAll this makes me realize that \"discretionary\" isn't a really good term. For one thing, originally it was apparently an issue of facilitation (not caprice), plus it makes me ask: is the \"fi\" ligature in fact more important than the \"ct\" and \"st\", or is it perhaps that _an \"f\" with a strong beak is in fact itself \"discretionary\"?!_   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The examples that she shows are consistent with this. Her style also doesn't ligate except in tt, ra (which looks cool) and the ear on the g lending itself as the dot on i in a gi combination.   \n   \nThe Mercator ligation does seem mannered especially in the word est and in the ct, though I think in the st ligation using the long s makes it look more natural.   \n   \nI think that the thin joins in Digital Fournier are definitely distracting. I asked my lady to read a page of the text and tell me what she thought, and she said those connectors on the s and t make me crazy. So in my informal survey, we're not the only ones.   \n   \nI have to say that ct and st ligatures can sure look cool. I like the idea of them. I think that the space between the letters having an arcing top could be nice like in the psalter example. I'd definitely consider including these ligatures in an italic companion to a text face.   \n   \nPersonally, I think that ff fi tt _are_ more important.   \n   \nAs for the 'discretionary' descriptor, the employement of any ligatures would seem to be at the discretion of the typesetter, as their design is at the discretion of the type designer. Not really wrong but...   \n   \nIt may be more useful to make a distinction about how **critical** a ligature is. In this regard I would say that fi is more critical than ct, as fi affords greater opportunity for letter shape collision and murkyness than st. Also since the st _is_ a chirographic descendant, I would argue that it's existence is less critical and more appropriate to italic forms (though not exclusively). I think I would enjoy seeing a text face where the ct and st looping isn't as sculptered as in Digital Fournier, but more integrated as in the psalter example. And I could imagine that it could look very attractive...   \n   \nJon\n\n"

      "content": "\\>If a 't' follows, you are now in a good position to loop upwards to the top of the stroke.   \n   \nSorry Victor, the writer is in a difficult position.   \nTo make the typical ct or st join according to the technique you describe, one has to push upwards (bottom right to top left) from the end of the c or s, digging the pen into the paper.   \n   \nHowever, it IS possible to do such a \"backwards\" stroke, keeping the pen barely touching the paper, and the stroke brief.   \n   \nAnd it's a skill worth mastering, because the alternative is to bring one's pen back to the same spot three times, and each time to halt and raise/drop the pen: once at the end of the final \"c\" stroke, once at the beginning of the \"t \" diagobal upstroke (see Camp, in above JW post), and once again for the beginning of the \"t\" crossbar. This does not feel like good, flowing calligraphy, and I think this is one reason why calligraphy has developed the \"ct\" and \"st\" ligatures, to avoid this constricted series of motions.   \n   \nAnother chirographic reason: from an aesthetic point of view, the combinations ct and st are unsatisfying, because the horizontal strokes at the top of the \"x height\" are close, and yet one cannot render them as one horizontal joining stroke (as in ti and fi), because that would mess up the c/s (for the same reason that one does not top-join ci and si as ligatures). So, finishing the c/s with a flourished ligature provides a sense that the character has been concluded purposefully.   \n   \nWhy did the ct and st ligatures persist in type when so many others were dropped?   \n   \nBecause the humanist t with its very short ascender is a weak glyph. It looks quite similar to r and c in old-style faces from Bembo to Caslon. The ct and st ligatures add distinction, in more ways than one.\n\n"

So there is definitely a reason to incorporate the more difficult strokes into one's style.   \n   \nInterestingly, a determining factor as to whether one executes a difficult ligature in a single move involving pushes, or splits it to avoid them, is how much ink is left in one's pen, and how smoothly it's flowing. If one has recently dipped, it's easier to do push strokes.\n\n"

However, you will notice Nick is not speaking of the \"long st ligature\" but rather the \"ct ligature\". Follow? That the \"ct ligature\" is crucial to avoid confusing the \"c\" as if it were in fact an \"i\".   \n   \nYou know something, most typographers have forgotten this when printing medical texts, military manuals, modern scientific and mathematical texts not to mention legal contracts.

What is your source? The \"Wizard of Ozz?\" Not that I disbelieve you. Just that I would like to understand the nature of the objection myself. Unlike yourself I have \"a more than considerable hot metal understanding'. I have \"a working mans perspective\". In other words this system is crapolla.   \n   \nThere were many inventions and logotype schemes. Setting ligatures, (logotype) in hot metal \"does not save time\". If they did the non union shops would have welcomed them, yes?   \n   \nThe more ligatures, the more memory, the more travel of the hands, arms or body. Remember, Chinese often set type using roller skates. [http://lanstontype.com/ChineseWindow.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826124347/http:/lanstontype.com/ChineseWindow.html) Maybe the British Unions did not think \"roller skating was part of their job description\".   \n   \nThe California Job Case has spaces for ligatures, (logotypes). Believe me, they were not located in the major traffic zones. They were kept \"out in the back forty\". The boxes were so tiny it was hard getting your fingers into them, often the \"labour hoot saving logotype ligatures\" would jam themselves tight against the sides.   \n   \nMemory failure is certainly a consideration, if one did not realize at first they were setting a ligature, (logotype) they would have to think, stop, distribute the characters and then go for that obscure box containing _\"time and labour saving logotype, if only they had known they needed one, remember where it was, and had not loaned their roller skates to the baby sitter\"._   \n   \nSo don't go all \"romantic, poetic and nostalgic on me about hot metal\". I can't stand to see a grown digital junky weep.   \n   \nGet the picture.   \n   \nTell me how many ems per hour was set with that silly scheme you have dug up. I can't wait for you to remember all those combinations and where they go. The hoot word breaks would be interesting to watch. Want to make a wager, how about a \"race\"?   \n   \nAnyway, that said, I am glad your are interested in this sort of thing. If I ever get to my material I would welcome a more elaborate discussion on the many different inventions. Don't take this as a criticism, it is a backhanded compliment.   \n   \n������������   \n   \n   \nNick   \n   \nYour calligraphy is pretty good.   \n   \nSo good you have clearly illustrated why no one would ever have mistake a \"c\" for an \"i\".   \n   \nThank you.\n\n"
