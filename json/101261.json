  "content": "Hi guys,  \nMore than 15 years ago, I was fiddling around with a logotype for my cousin's company. I want to do some edits to the logo, but I can't seem to be able to ID the font and I have no further info on where to find it.  \nIn spite of my recommendation, my cousin used the font at some point in time, to product body text in a brochure. It looks awful, but it might just be my life line, since I can provide you with sample text to cover almost the entire alphabet .  \nI am attaching it hereby, with thanks in advance for helping me out.\n\nBest regards,  \nVictor\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [alp font CAPITALS.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015221944/http:/typophile.com/files/alp%20font%20CAPITALS.JPG) | 204 KB |\n| [alp font.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015221944/http:/typophile.com/files/alp%20font.JPG) | 237.92 KB |\n\n",
