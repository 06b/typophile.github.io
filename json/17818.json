The font was changed recently.\n\nThe closest I’ve come so far is ITC Conduit, but there are still quite a few differences.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/gee1.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/gee2a.jpg)\n\n",

I actually like Blender, it’s more subtle, but I can see a little too much of Radio in Pemba. I’m attaching a comparison of Gridnik (in black) vs Blender (in gray). They are definitely very similar.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/blendnik.jpg)\n\n"
