In HTML there is no other use of a double-click, than bypassing a FontShop redirect. ;-)\n\nBut it works for me in any browser or newsreader. I don’t know enough about FontShops redirect mechanism to tell you why this works. Maybe it’s just a bug and the redirect doesn’t work if you fire multiple calls to the website, or maybe they included this trick on purpose as a backdoor, so the guys in Berlin can look at their international sites once in a while ...\n\nRalf\n\n"

Having worked at FontShop and been involved directly in oversight of web development projects there, I can attest to the fact that trying to find out what fonts users have installed on their hard drives was never on the extremely long dev wishlist. The good people at FontShop have more important things to think about, like how to market typefaces, service customers, and take care of designers who choose to work with them.\n\nCookies are a fact of internet life, and not typically intended for nefarious purposes (at least when browsing the online shops of reputable companies).\n\nWith regard to the issue of being directed to your home country/region’s website for font purchases, the folks at FontShop have struggled with that and are really trying to build a good user experience while adhering to contractual agreements with the various local FontShops.
