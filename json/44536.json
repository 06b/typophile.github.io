  "content": "Not sure if I'm just missing something but when I build paragraph styles in InDesign and apply them to text the style definitions are applied to the text. I've been able to then modify the style definitions (say change the typeface, size or color) and have those modifications appear in the text where ever that style was previously applied.\n\nHowever now I'm finding situations where I modify the style, but the text that already has the style applied does not change to show the modifications.\n\n1. I'm in InDesign CS3, but I've now had someone tell me its happened in CS2.  \n2. The paragraph style doesn't have the \"+\" by the name to show that the text using it has been modified outside of the style definition.  \n3. This is not text I'm cutting and pasting or placing from an outside source. This is text that I've created directly in the InDesign document.  \n4. I don't have the file in question, but I don't believe there were any Character styles applied, though if there were, it seems it should only leave those characters alone, not the whole paragraph.  \n5. Even though the changes don't show up, selecting the type in questions shows the correct style is applied in the paragraph style palette. Editing the style shows the changes are there.\n\nAny questions to help me figure this out I'd be happy to address. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\n",
