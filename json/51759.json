So, here is my attempt for: regular letters (capital and small), old style numbers, latin ligatures and plucky try for cyrillic ligatures. I really want to know your opinion about them. Also, and for this typeface at all. Each comment will be valuable!\n\n[Lanita Latin](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417143956/http:/ipopov.net/vector/wip_lanita_1.jpg)\n\n[Lanita Cyrillic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417143956/http:/ipopov.net/vector/wip_lanita_2.jpg)\n\n",
