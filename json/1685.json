However two parting shots.   \n   \nFirst, John H., an Israeli liberal who is an old friend, and was there in 48, said that what Israel did then was not terrorism, as it was only directed against the military. However, he does view the attacks now against Arabs in the occupied territories as terrorist.   \n   \nSecond, Hrant, all of your analysis seems to support the 9/11 attacks on the US.

Even the bombing of the King David Hotel was clearly a strike against the British military command centre there, and the Irgun actively sought to avoid civilian casualties by alerting the hotel, the neutral French consolate, and the Palestine Post newspaper ahead of the bombing. None of the warnings were taken seriously.   \n   \nCharges are made that Palestinian civilians were targeted during the '48 war, in order to encourage them to abandon their villages. Frankly, I don't know enough about the evidence to comment.   \n   \nIn my previous message, I was talking about the perception of the Haganah and Irgun campaigns by others, who see only the apparent success of a struggle of illegal, geurilla organisations to win a country for themselves by killing people and blowing things up. Who they were killing and what they were blowing up are details that don't necessarily register in such a perception.\n\n"

And when somebody in the US for example votes for a president based on the hope that that president will \"kill the bastards\", he becomes an active part of the problem._   \n   \nSo do you think, after WWII the Nurenberg courts should have hung every German who joined or even voiced any support for the Nazi party? Or do you accept that people can be wrong, and can be brought to understand that they were wrong, and can change their ideas.   \n   \nActually, no, I don't think leaders and members of _civilian_ governments are legitimate targets in war (this is not true of military states; and I'm not sure where Bush's status as Commander in Chief leaves him). I don't like Tony Blair, and I don't think the invasion of Iraq was justified even on the grounds that he attempted to justify it, but I don't think that makes him a legitimate target for military action. He is a legitimate target for international legal action, along with any other civilian leader.   \n   \n_Why do you think terrorists focus on killing \"non-combatants\" in Democracies?_   \n   \nFor the same reason that terrorists target civilians in non-democratic countries: because they're soft targets.   \n   \nAccording to your previous messages, the USA practices terrorism on a vast scale, but if they're attacking non-democracies such as Iraq, what is the point of terrorism? If you genuinely think that the US deliberately targets civilians, why would that be? It's not like the Iraqi people had any influence on Saddam Hussein's policies.\n\n"

      "content": "Gerald, from the other thread:   \n   \n_Are saying that Iraq was a terrorist nation?_   \n   \nYes, as clear from the targeting of their own civilian population, especially ethnic and religious minorities but also political opponents.   \n   \n_That Bush and Blaire were morally justified in attacking Iraq because of that?_   \n   \nNo, unless they're willing to attack everyone, everywhere who deliberately targets civilians. They're neither willing nor capable of that, so it is unsound as a justification for attacking a particular country.   \n   \n_Are you saying that daisy bombs are not terrifying?_   \n   \nNo. I'm saying that not everything that is terrifying is terrorism. It depends on whom you are dropping the daisycutter. [There is a completely different discussion to be had about appropriate force during war, but that is not a discussion about terrorism.]   \n   \n_Are you suggesting that it would not be terrifying to be a Palestinian? That Palestinians have not lost innocent people._    \n   \nNot at all, and I maintain that if the Israeli government and military are _deliberately_ targeting non-combatants then they are terrorists.   \n   \nPerhaps I can make it clearer by putting it this way: I am taking a politically neutral view of terrorism (but not a morally neutral view). I'm saying that the definition terrorism has nothing to do with the rightness of one's cause, or the desperateness of one's situation. I'm saying that terrorism is an identifiable _act_ that involves the intentional killing or injury of civilians. The fact that life for Palestinians in the occupied territories is terrible and terrifying does not mean that a Palestinian militant blowing up a bus full of civilians in Jerusalem is somehow not terrorism. It is terrorism.   \n   \nOf course, a political neutral view of terrorism suggests the possibility that terrorism _can be justified_: a possibility that even supporters of the Palestinian cause, and the Northern Irish Catholic cause, and a hundred other violently expressed causes around the world, are themselves, apparently, uncomfortable with. Hence the unwillingness to call spades spades and terrorism terrorism, and the popular artificial distinction between terrorists and freedom fighters.   \n   \n_Would that not make Israel a terrorist state?_   \n   \nIf they deliberately target non-combatants, yes. This was certainly the case when Israeli forces let Phalangist militias into the refugee camps at Sabra and Shatila to massacre Palestinian civilians. That was an act of terrorism. Sharon, who was Defence Minister at the time, was forced to resign as a result, but this would be far from sufficient justice even if he hadn't returned as Prime Minister.   \n   \n_So just what do you expect the Palestinian to do? Lie down and die, don't make a fuss because it might upset our dictionary?_   \n   \nGerald, did you read what I wrote? I never said that the Palestinians should lie down and die, but nor should they pretend that acts of terrorism are somehow not terrorism. Maybe they think it is the only strategy they have -- terrorism has traditionally been the military strategy of the desperate -- but that doesn't make it something other than terrorism.   \n   \nOne more example: when a group of desperate English Catholics decided to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill the king and his ministers, they became terrorists, although the term didn't exist in 1605. It doesn't make it not terrorism that their civilian targets were in positions of authority, or that their civilian targets were persecuting them, killing their priests and friends, imprisoning them for their beliefs, and stealing their property. It doesn't make it not terrorism that I am sympathetic to their cause, even though they were both morally and politically mistaken in their choice of strategy.   \n   \nAll I have said in this discussion is that we should call terrorism by name when we see it, and not get confused by our sympathies or by the real and desperate plight of many people who resort to terrorism (although this obviously doesn't include Saudi millionaires).\n\n"

This is what I referred to earlier -- what no one seems to want to acknowledge -- that terrorism can be politically and even legally justified (I don't believe it can be morally justified). There was a time when the PLO were proud of their status as international terrorists: before Arafat became media friendly. Abu Daoud, who masterminded the murder of Israeli atheletes at the 1972 Olympics under direct order from Arafat, entitled his autobiography _Memoirs of a Palestinian Terrorist._ That is how he identified himself. Indeed, if you decide to pursue terrorism as a strategy, there is a large propaganda impact to be gained from declaring the fact: letting people know that you are targeting them increases the terror. Of course, calling yourself a terrorist in 2003 is going to put you in the gunsights of the world's only superpower, so terrorists are understandably less keen to own the name. That doesn't change the nature of what they do, whether you think it is justified by their circumstances or not.\n\n"

      "content": "No, Gerald, I don't think we're talking about the same thing. I've provided a definition of what terrorism is that makes it possible to identify terrorists by their actions: deliberately targeting civilians for death or injury. Anyone who does that -- regardless of their nationality, political or religious allegiance, circumstance, position of power or lack of power -- is practicing terrorism and is a terrorist. What does this have to do with Iraelis and Palestinians? Only as much as _some_ Israelis are terrorists and _some_ Palestinians are terrorists. Calling these people terrorists does not mean that all Israelis and all Palestinians are terrorists, nor does it say anything about the rights and wrongs of the conflict in the Middle East.   \n   \nAs regards giving hope to the Palestinians in the occupied territories, who are in most need of hope, the Arab nations are and always have been in the best position to provide that hope. They have chosen to leave the Palestinians as a festering wound in the side of Israel rather than offer either homes or material assistance. [With the singular exceptance of Jordan, which has always been the home of most Palestinians.] Likewise, the Palestinians' own political leadership offers no hope to its people, being rife with corruption and interested only in maintaining power. A couple of years ago, Canada offered to accept Palestinian refugees as immigrants, so some at least could build new lives in a safe country. The response from Hezbollah, a Palestinian 'political' organisation, was that Canada would be a target of terrorism if it dared to accept Palestinian immigrants.   \n   \nHistory is full of refugees leaving their homes and settling elsewhere. In 1948, at the same time as Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes, hundreds of thousands of Jews fled or were forced from their homes in Arab countries -- where their families had lived for centuries -- and settled in Israel. These people are not still living in refugee camps more than half a century later, so why are the Palestinians?   \n   \nOr perhaps you prefer this parallel: In 1945-46, hundreds of thousands of Germans fled that part of their country that was ceded to Poland in the aftermath of WWII. These refugees found new homes in other countries. When was the last time you heard it suggested that Poland should give that land back to Germany or allow all German refugees to return there?\n\n"

For some reason, �political motive� has been substituted by the concept of innocent people. I am not clear who first entered that consideration into this discussion. But �innocent people� can not be found in the definition of terrorism in either my two dictionaries.   \n   \nUnfortunately innocence is a casualty of war.   \n   \nTo discuss the meaning of a two part word by excluding the second part could certainly lead to some confusion as we both can see.   \n   \nSo you will have to forgive me. Or at least I hope you will.   \n   \nMy biggest objection to �coin word terrorism� is that it leaves no room for \"resolution\". Most disgusting is the implied \"linkage\" that \"Islamic peoples\" are by nature \"terrorists\". Linkage was the instrument of �American Foreign Policy� as implemented by Richard Nixon. Linkage is not only affective but it can actuate moral benefit. In this case it is affective but morally repugnant.   \n   \nCertainly skin colour is the implied enemy uniform when crossings into the USA, would you think not? Not only implied, but worse, \"applied racism\" by way of policy.   \n   \nTerrorism as we now speak of it is nothing other than a \"spin buzz word\" designed to baffle the attention impaired. We should call it by a name that has historical traditions that make way for the possibility of resolution. \"War, or conflict.\"   \n   \nTerrorism, as now coined, implies random drive by shootings, nut case snipers, and sex slayers. For these there is no \"resolution\" because there nothing to be negotiated.   \n   \nWar and political strife on the other hand give much reason for negotiation. There are more similarities in humans than there are differences. A simple assumption for basis of negotiations. Bill Clinton believed it to be possible.   \n   \nThe cost of winning in the Palestinian conflict is the return of human dignities to its inhabitants. This is a price we can all afford.   \n   \nBut you will not win any war against terrorism by name calling. We are finding that out. There are issues that are needy of address. America is the embodiment of exceptional opportunities with traditions of wisdom. I am not, as some may have previously concluded, �Anti American�.   \n   \nMy two great heroes in politics would be Gandhi and Ronald Reagan. Both were pacifists.   \n [http://www.questia.com/Index.jsp?CRID=mahatma\\_gandhi&OFFID=se1](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518122914/http:/www.questia.com/Index.jsp?CRID=mahatma_gandhi&OFFID=se1)   \nRonald Reagan read �Diplomacy� Henry Kissinger� Simon & Schuster\n\n"

Bush, terrorism hasn't political motives, nor motives of any kind : the only aim and cause is \"evil\".   \nNo nation succeed in definying terrorism, so they do lists, lists of terrorists groups. No critaria bacause no definition : lists, made more politicallty and accordingly to events and diplomacy than logical argument.\n\n"
