  "content": "What would be a good serif font to accompany Cholla Sans & Slab fonts for a technical guide? I had been using Weidemann Book and liked the light, compact feel but feel it's a bit old fashioned and was going to switch to Rotis Semi Serif to give it a more modern look but that font seems funny. Other fonts I looked at were Trump Medieveal, Swift, Apollo, and they all kind of have more of a book reading feel and not really technical guide. Any suggestions?\n\n",
