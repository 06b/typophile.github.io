  "content": "I'm working on a project for a senior class at my school. The project is about typography and fine art. I'm designing three alphabets and painting them onto a canvas, to make the point that typography is a fine art.   \n   \nMy professor is asking that we find ten 'contemporary' artists that are doing what we're doing. So do any of you know of people who are treating type as a fine art. ie incorporating it into painting, sculpture or anything like that. Something beyond simply designing a font.   \n   \nI've looked around and I haven't really seen much of this, but if you know of anyone who is doing this I'd greatly appreciate your input.   \n   \nIf you have any questions about what I mean exactly feel free to ask as well. Thanks!\n\n",
