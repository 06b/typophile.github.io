With 7 weights and over 1000 glyphs per style, Graublau Sans is a type family that suits all typographic tasks. The regular styles have a rather clean and neutral appearance. The italics on the other hand, have a vivid design based on handwriting. For the use in headlines or logotypes Graublau Sans Pro offer 6 additional display styles with rounded corners and tighter spacing.<br>\nBeside the typical western codepages, Graublau Sans Pro also supports Greek, Cyrillic, CE (Central European) and Turkish. There are also several sets of figures available: oldstyle figures and lining figures (both proportional and tabular), small caps figures, fraction figures, subscript and superscript figures and figures inside circles.</cite>\n\nExclusively available at fonts.info:  \n [http://www.fonts.info/info/en\\_graublau-sans-pro.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015033925/http:/www.fonts.info/info/en_graublau-sans-pro.htm \"http://www.fonts.info/info/en\\_graublau-sans-pro.htm\")\n\n",

      "content": "Chris,\n\nKeep working on yours. Yes, the Graublau Sans is lovely. Yes, there is a humanist sans fatigue among certain people. But remember that the Typophile community is a tiny fraction of the type using public, and one never knows what captures the public's attention. Four years is a long development. It may be best to work faster, release quicker, and then move on to the next design. Paraphrasing something I read about poetry, \"Type design is never finished, only abandoned.\"\n\n"

Naaa....\n\nYour Now Sans is lovely, and even though it resembles other humanist sans, I found something very special about it. Also remember what Matthew Carter said at your critique at TypeCon: Finish this one first!\n\nI love Froggy more, but probably you should listen to Carter and not me :)\n\n"

      "content": "My comments weren't meant to discourage further releases in the humanist sans vein. And in part they reflect the fact that I spent the last 3 months looking at dozens of humanist sans as I searched for one to recommend as my employer's new corporate face.\n\nBut I think the sheer volume of offerings available in this genre means that new releases must work harder to be noticed, whether that's in design, features or marketing.\n\n"
