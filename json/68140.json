So Æ was essentially just a graphic variant of AE and not accorded special status in Classical Latin. But then the diphthong represented by the digraph AE began to be pronounced as a single sound in Later Latin, eventually merging with E, and the ligature Æ became a useful shorthand for this.\n\n"

In Roman inscriptions, though, whether it is a diphthong has nothing to do with whether it is ligatured. Any pair (or occasionally more) of letters in any word can be ligatured, if it makes sense graphically. It's purely a design/layout decision.\n\n(ETA - I should check for new posts before hitting the button...)\n\n"

Since it's neither vertical nor really diagonal, it makes the glyph look left-leaning (\"linkskursiv\" or \"rückwärts liegend\" in German, I don't know the English term, if there is one). My choices are definitely Æ no. 1 and Œ no. 3, but for a sans serif I might chose Œ no. 1. Œ no. 4 is pleasing to the eye, but I feel it's not ligated enough. Œ no. 5 looks very Mannerist or Baroque, and might work in such a typeface.\n\nJust as I think the E is the important part of the Æ ligature, I think the O bit is most important for the Œ. I'm of course heavily culturally biased. The Œ is not used in modern Norwegian, but it's traditionally used for normalised transcription of the long Ø-sound in Old Norse. (These days, it's sadly being replaced by the (mostly) inaccessible and ugly Ø acute. Curse modern scholars!)\n\n"

In written form the Æ is written in just three strokes:  \n- the A angle and lower bar of E in one stroke: /\\_  \n- the crossbar of the A and E in one stroke: --  \n- the top bar of the E starting at the apex of the A:-  \nSo the right solution of the initial post is closer to a written form.\n\n@ Nick Shinn: yes, the crossbars should ideally be aligned - but this is usually difficult to achieve in bolder weights (the A counter becomes too small very fast ;)\n\nThere are many horribly designed \"Æ\"s out there, so be careful what you use for reference...\n\n"
