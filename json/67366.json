  "content": "I'm designing my first typeface, a contemporary serif family with four weights. I'd like to use massive contextual alternates (as in Kinescope or Vesper), but I have doubts about the limits to use this feature.\n\nI plan to adopt contextual alternates through stylistic sets for these situations:\n\n1. beginnings and endings;  \n2. glyphs collisions and undesired optical effects;  \n3. typesetting special symbols as arrows and flourishes;  \n4. Roman numerals;  \n5. chess notation with figurines (unsure about this one);  \n6. mathematical symbols and expressions.\n\nBesides this, there would also be optional variations in some glyphs (typically, Q, R, f, a) which could also be set with stylistic sets.\n\nSo, is there any problem to set dozens or even hundreds of contextual alternates in OT tables? This may cause poor performance?\n\nI understand some of the situations I listed could be addressed with GREP styles in InDesign (as Roman numerals and chess notation), but it would be nice if the font had all these features.\n\n",

In applications such as InDesign CS2 and Notepad running on Windows XP, tested some 4-5 years ago, there was a performance hit, i.e. using a really long text (100 pages or so), it does take noticeably longer time to lay out the pages than when a \"regular\" font is used.\n\nThough in InDesign, after the initial delay in laying out the pages, the performance is good, since InDesign caches the glyphs. In Notepad, such caching does not take place, so even scrolling up and down the pages was kind of slow.\n\nBut such complex fonts are rarely used for continuous text that has hundreds of pages. Plus, the computers and the applications have gotten faster in text processing. So the problem is going away. And the benefits of smart fonts are in my opinion worth paying the (small) price.\n\n"
