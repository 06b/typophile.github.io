I am using Hoefler and Frere-Jones’ [Mercury Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20080214122852/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/mercurydisplay/index.html) and [Mercury Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20080214122852/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/mercurytext/index.html) throughout, but I would like to compliment these by using a sans serif font for subheadings, captions, etc. Suggestions?\n\n [‹ Start 20th century french book fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080214122852/http:/typophile.com/node/18278 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Zapfino prose? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080214122852/http:/typophile.com/node/18286 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Once you can tell us which one of those we might be able to narrow it down.\n\n"

(Unless your budget has been blown on Mercury. ;-)\n\nUnit is also a great and very useful typeface from the rockstar duo of Erik Spiekermann on vocals and bass, and Christian Schwartz on lead guitar.\n\nAnd if you stick around for a few hours some type designers will stop by and suggest their own work.\n\n"
