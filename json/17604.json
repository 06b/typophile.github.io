After some research, it turns our what they are talking about is CID font encoding in a PDF. ID CS would encode almost everything this way, it seems to be \"fixed\" in CS2. My understanding is that CID font encoding is the way that Adobe dealt with the larger character set in Open Type. Is this correct?  \npeace\n\n",
