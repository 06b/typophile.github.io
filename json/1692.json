Right now I'm using a demo of Suitcase 11, and it works alright (still miss ATM tough). But I haven't read anything about [Alsoft's Masterjuggler](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000601/http:/www.alsoft.com/MasterJuggler/index.html), which seems to have a pretty neat interface.   \nDoes it have auto-activation?   \nAny experiences out there?\n\n",
