It looks like 2 seperate fonts...one for the capital C in Corona and for the lowercase. Anyone know a font that is close to these?\n\nI need to identify the lowercase, the C in Corona, and the E in extra.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n",

A simplified version of the caps of [Engraver's Old English](http://web.archive.org/web/20111219111314/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-old-english/) might do for the initial letters.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
