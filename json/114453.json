      "content": "Hello Moiz\n\nThis text looks very familiar and easy on the eye. Without analysing the details, it resembles the letterpress type pages of my school textbooks and newspapers of the 1950's and 1960's. I do not remember bold being used in such cases, though - so perhaps the font you showed is a later variant based on the old models.\n\nVladimir\n\n"
