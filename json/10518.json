The serifs have been flattened, but the basic letterforms, especially of the y and w are from the italic typeface.\n\n"

Even better would be Century Bold Italic Condensed, but I can't seem to find it. The biggest difference is that the l's and d have non-cursive forms and the H is missing the inside serifs.\n\n"
