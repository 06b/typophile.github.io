Chalet London 1960 for the heads, and probably Chalet Book for the text (it does have a geometric G):  \n [http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317070548/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet \"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet\")\n\nIf you can provide the name of the book, I may be able to confirm....\n\n"
