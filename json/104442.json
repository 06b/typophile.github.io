  "content": "Looking for advice on how to put the word out that we are launching a T-Shirt Design contest for our company. Hoping the prize of the winning designers becoming partners with us in the success of their designs is an exciting opportunity. Most contest sites pay only a couple of hundred dollars. We are looking for these designers to benefit from each and every item sold with their design. Also hoping some will eventually come and work for the company.\n\n",

I won't go into the whole thing as we've discussed it here before, but most of your submissions will come from amateurs and students. A pro making a good living is unlikely to do design work for free, unless perhaps it's for charity or there's a huge potential payoff.\n\nA vague promise of profits someday or a potential job generally don't mean much. If you really want to hire someone, do it the regular way and post an ad, interview people, review their portfolios, and hire someone. Or if money is tight, hire freelancers to do individual jobs.\n\n"

Big design offices don't bother with spec work, they don't want it or need it. The Sharks, potential clients who try to lure those starving individuals from the masses to work for free, never approach the big guys.

BTW, I only detest certain individuals, and extremely few; corporations don't deserve such emotions.\n\nChris, it's pretty simple: the biggest losers from spec work aren't the young, up-and-coming designers whose time isn't so valuable yet anyway - it's the big, tight-ship, over-charging studios (that as a rule produce culturally lethargic work). And they don't just lose money by losing given commissions - every time a beginner wins a spec commission (which means he has more talent than average), what it would cost for a studio to hire him goes up too.\n\nIt's not that I want designers to be taken advantage of - quite the contrary! I simply believe that a berserker crusade against any and all spec work does most of us harm, especially culturally: no matter what your vocation, if you're only interested in money, I don't feel the world really needs you. Plus it really makes no sense to neuter natural human competitiveness - we have to properly leverage it instead.\n\nDon't believe the hype - think for yourself and don't be a tool for the holy cows of the design world.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Personally, if I were interested in holding a design competition, especially as part of a product development process, I would contact AIGA or Icograda or one of the other large design organisations and ask them to help me shape it in a way that they would endorse, and which would then make the competition attractive to their members.\n\n"
