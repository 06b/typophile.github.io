I cannot figure out what I am doing that makes these things appear. What am I doing to cause this, and how do I make the guides go away with dragging them away one by one?\n\n [‹ Fontlab opentype features](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708211942/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45037 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Clever way to make a font with only uppercase letters? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708211942/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44964 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

When your mouse is over it it will change to a double vertical arrow allowing you to drag down a global (red) guide. If you just accidently click this bar it will still place a guide. A quick way to remove all guides is to move to the guides layer in a glyphs window and right click a ruler bar and choose remove guides.  \nhope this helps,  \nJosh\n\n"
