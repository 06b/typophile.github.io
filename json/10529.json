Regarding your last note and checking to see that no other codepages are active, do you mean in the Encoding & Unicode section of the Font Info dialogue?   \n   \nIn Supported Codepages and Default Character Set I have only 1252 Latin 1 in the list, and in the Supported Unicode Ranges I have only Basic Latin selected. Does this sound right?   \n   \nThanks again for your input...\n\n"
