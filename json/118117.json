But I really love it!\n\n[http://www.einaudi.it/var/einaudi/contenuto/extra/978880621249PCA.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123083807/http:/www.einaudi.it/var/einaudi/contenuto/extra/978880621249PCA.pdf \"http://www.einaudi.it/var/einaudi/contenuto/extra/978880621249PCA.pdf\")\n\nCan you suggest a commercial typeface similar to this jewel? At the moment the only alternative I know is Simoncini Garamond.\n\nThanks  \nM.\n\n",

Unfortunately SG is a typeface a bit neglected by Adobe/Linotype: no pro, only three weights, limited kerning...\n\nIn fact the usage of Simoncini Garamond (and its many custom versions) as text font is really widespread among Italian book publishers. In Italy it is probably the most successful typeface of the twentieth century, but the only beautiful digital version is, in my opinion, the custom typeface currently used by Einaudi.\n\n"
