But don’t come complaining afterwards that they only have a limited character set, poor spacing and don’t perform very well. There _is_ a reason why almost all proper fonts need to be paid for. Maybe read these, and come back next week for the issue of spacing.\n\n[An Introduction to Type design | The Type Designer as Artist](http://web.archive.org/web/20080429225018/http:/www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=161)  \n [An Introduction to Type design | The Type Designer as Craftsman](http://web.archive.org/web/20080429225018/http:/www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=230)\n\n"
