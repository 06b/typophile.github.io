You could try [LTC Goudy Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145246/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-goudy-text/) or [Wedding Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145246/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/wedding-text/) to come close, but the only way to have an exact replica is to do it yourself (or get the actual EPS from someone at the Inquirer).\n\n"
