  "content": "I designed a logotype for a client based on DTL Prokyon small caps. We offered several logotypes, but the Prokyon is what they want (coincidentally, the decision-makers are Dutch). To make things nice and neat, I have been exploring the possibility of using the Prokyon Pro family for the client's identity, since underneath the company name is one those descriptor lines that we all love so much. They would probably end up using the chosen type for all sorts of design-free internal projects, like presentations, and we would be using it for all collateral, signage, and so on.\n\nAdmirers of DTL all share the inevitable heartbreak of facing the prices on DTL fonts: €100 per font, per weight, per style for PS1, €250 per font, per weight, per style for OTF. Hence, these typefaces are encountered about as often as one encounters a Bugatti 57SC Atlantic. What's more, DTL fonts are sold as individual licenses, not the usual 5 CPU license, with the price decreasing by about half for each additional license.\n\nAssuming the client balks at the exorbitant fee, which is likely and not wholly unreasonable, I will need a substitute font to match the logotype. The distinct features of the letters of Prokyon which I am using are the katana-like leg of the R, the gentle outward swelling of the counters, and a generally glyphic character. Being in small caps lends a slightly gawky-eyed, extended feel to it. Two substitutes I think may be close are Monotype Gill Sans Pro (the R is too weak) and FF Nexus, which is close but doesn't have the range of weights I would like.\n\nCan anyone suggest some possible substitutes?  \nThe font comes from here:  \n [http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Adres.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111122140/http:/www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Adres.html \"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Adres.html\")  \nAnd it looks like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111122140im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DTL_Prokyon.gif)\n\n",

Scala was one of the first ones that came to mind, since it's just a short leap from Gill, but it was just used on an excruciating project so I'm taking a break from it. The R is very no-nonsense and a bit narrow.\n\nTschichold and Nexus seem the closest. But neither really has the subtlety of the DTL fonts.

      "content": "I think claes' theory can go either way. I prefer to plan out the type system as a serif and a sans, preferably of the same basic design or designer. At least the same x-height. Ideally there would also be a couple of display faces thrown in for larger projects, like magazines. The alterations I made to the original Prokyon are not easily reproduced by simply typing out the letters. But for the most part, I agree that there should be a level of contrast. In fact, I would prefer to use something that is visually concussive.\n\nIn this case I am sticking to a one family system. It's for a company that designs, builds and sells modular buildings. Since there are other companies that have the same name that do other things, as is often the case, they have a descriptor line under the company name to specify which \"Company X\" they are. The logo was designed as a three-color, type/bug pair, and with the descriptor below the type it starts to get pretty busy. So I am opting for a single type family because anything else would be visual suicide.\n\nAnother option is to use a typeface that is nearly invisible, like Akzidenz-Grotesk. But it is a different kind of sans, and it just seems plain silly to mix a humanist with a grotesque.\n\n"

The problem manifests itself that when you try to use it in an application — in my case, Illustrator CS on OSX — it behaves like a Postscript font. When you switch to small caps, it makes the fake small caps out of the full caps. Selecting any alternate figures produces no result. All OpenType options in the OT palette, including all standard ligatures, are greyed-out and disabled. The only way to access any character that deviates from the standard 256 PS/TTF character slots is to insert it manually from the glyphs palette. Furthermore, switching to a different Pro font, including other weights of the same family, causes some characters to change into different characters. For example, the 'st' ligature changes into an 's' with a caron, and an alternate ampersand turns into a percentage sign or lozenge. Thus the Unicode glyph maps are inconsistent. The multiple language support (it has full-on cyrillic built in) may have something to do with it.\n\nStorm says it works fine on a Windows XP box, but that does me little good. I think he was in a rush to release it in OpenType, and did not test it properly. Fortunately, all his fonts carry a lifetime guarantee.\n\n"
