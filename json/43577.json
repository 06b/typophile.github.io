Now that the typeface is finished, it’s evident that Calgary Script was highly influenced by the many books on American sign painting I have absorbed over the years. The overall effect feels graphically slick, like something out of the early 1980s, but still hearkens back to a few decades earlier. Impressive caps and a free-flowing lowercase make for a speedy, determined, and instinctively organized typeface. Foremost a packaging font with a true supermarket spin, Calgary Script is chock full of OpenType features including ligatures, alternates, and ordinals designed specifically to follow numbers.\n\n[Http://www.sudtipos.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080604063240/http:/www.sudtipos.com/ \"//www.sudtipos.com\")\n\n",
