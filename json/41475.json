These had some sizes (but not all) recut under the direction of <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080130014248/http:/typophile.com/wiki/G%2525C3%2525BCnter%252BGerhard%252BLange\" class=\"wiki-create\">Günter Gerhard Lange</a>, who was their (freelance) artistic director at the time.</cite>\n\n"
