I ask because the curve on the \"c\" that tangent the line in the \"W\" do not look to good. If it's not important for the design I'd recommend fixing that. Should be easy to fix if you decide so.\n\n"

      "content": "The \"C\" overlap was an attempt to make the whole thing a little more interesting and also to tie \"Creek\" to \"Wolfe\" without losing the single defining \"W\" which I really like. Possibly not as good an idea as I had thought.\n\nThanks for your input,  \nholzgrafe\n\n"
