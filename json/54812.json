  "content": "Last year some friends opened a shop called Gubb & Mackie on Customs Street in downtown Auckland; when I visited the shop they had just refurbished the place and unearthed this mid-20th century mosaic from under the floor vinyl, welcome mat and god-knows-what-else.\n\nInteresting to see how much extra trouble the lettering artist of the day had gone to over that angular ampersand; I figure that by the time they'd trimmed all the tiles to allow for the diagonal insets, it couldn't have been much of a time-saver.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016195300im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ampersand_mosaic_4173.jpg)\n\n",
