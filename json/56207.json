Somehow, I have to convince my boss that it is a good idea for me to learn [Python](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203173616/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Python).\n\nSo my question is, aside from using the Django frameworks which I am already tentatively working with, what else could I possibly use as an argument to let me spend company time learning Python? Specifically, what can I do with it that will best build the skills needed to use Python effectively in working specifically with type, but also are productive for Python use in general?\n\n",
