Its from my friends dessert blog, we're making him a birthday present and it would be awesome if I could make him a card in a similar style. I would ask him what font he used, but it's supposed to be a surprise.\n\nTried a couple of websides that help with font identification, came up with nothing. You're my only hope ;)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140124061057im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_3862.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140124061057/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_56.png) | 15.92 KB |\n\n",
