  "content": "ok currently im creating a bold verison of a typeface i created. what i have done so far is make the MM and i went to actions and put in the desired measurements in for the bold action and clicked applied. fare enuff that was simple. but it didnt create the bold the way i wanted it to. i wanted to create the bold by just moving 1 side of the glyph for example on a lowercase n the inside left stem and the outside right stem would be moved to make it bolder, so it would not increase too much in character width.\n\ni tried the same with the interpolate tool and it was a huge sucess but! i cant replicate the exact number of units i made the glyph wider. i went throu all the setting trying to find away to tell and i cant find anything. is there something im missing. even in the help file it doesnt state exactly how to achieve that.\n\ncan anyone clue me in if that is possible and the best way to go about it.\n\nthank you\n\n",
