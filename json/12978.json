All new signs will be in Frutiger and old signs will take around a decade to be completely replaced with Frutiger signs. The reason for this is that Frutiger is considered far more legible than the previous font, which was introduced in the 1960s and 1970s. “\n\non this website [http://frutiger.biography.ms/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011170054/http:/frutiger.biography.ms/ \"http://frutiger.biography.ms/\")\n\nSo if you´re sure that the Belgian signage font is the same as the swiss, than you have your answer.\n\n"
