From €210 for 8 cpus users.\n\n[Parisine Office PTF page](http://web.archive.org/web/20110221122652/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisineOfficePTF)  \n [Parisine Office PTF prices and purchase](http://web.archive.org/web/20110221122652/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/order/ParisineOfficePTF)  \n [Parisine Office PTF big size samples page](http://web.archive.org/web/20110221122652/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/samples/samples_parisineofficeptf)  \n [Parisine Office PTF pdf specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20110221122652/http:/www.typofonderie.com/icono/alphabets/pdf/ParisineOfficePTF_pdf.pdf)\n\nThis new variation “PTF” is an extension of the tailored Parisine Office made for RATP. It include many more valuables features who will improve dramatically the user experience. The new Parisine Office PTF with its smaller xheight will perform better on text setting and editorial projects. The design of the italic lowercases is more cursive than in Parisine PTF.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110221122652im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Poptf_2.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [parisineofficeptf\\_02.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20110221122652/http:/typophile.com/files/parisineofficeptf_02.gif) | 36.31 KB |\n| [Poptf\\_2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20110221122652/http:/typophile.com/files/Poptf_2.png) | 42.28 KB |\n\n",
