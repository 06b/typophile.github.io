      "content": "Four days?! Blasphemy! ;-)   \n   \nI lived there for about 6 months (back in '93) and have been back twice for a few days, and it's my single most favorite city in this world. It's a place with design gushing out of every corner, and the people strike a unique balance between Western elegance and Old-World warmth. And there are about fifty \"The Restaurants\"... One I would recommend very highly is Cal Pep (a tiny but superclassy shellfish place), off of Pla�a del Palau - but there really are too many to note. Just concentrate on the shellfish and tapas (and the paella in the older, dinkier joins in Barcelonetta) and you'll be in heaven. And the Crema Catalana. And the hot chocolate on the south side of Las Ramblas... :-/ But as tempting as it is, try not to eat too much: this is the ultimate walking city, where every step will be rewarded. (Jeez, I sound like a tourist trap...)   \n   \nJust make sure to get a whole lot of sleep before you get there.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
