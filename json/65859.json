  "content": "I'm a little bit confused and really don't know what happened the last two weeks.  \nI didn't open Fontlab since december 16th and yesterday i wanted to work again on a multiple master font which i created 2 months ago. Everything is working fine until the point where i want to adjust the kerning. When i change a figure in the kerning table, fontlag suddenly crashes.  \nThis is just happening with MM-files, when i want to open a normal .vfb FontLab still works fine.\n\nDoes anyone know this Problem.\n\nOn my system there was just one change. The Installer wanted to update Java for Mac OsX.  \nI'm working with MaxOS 10.5.8.\n\nI really don't know what happened the last two weeks.\n\n",
