It's from my Grandfathers (actually Great grandfathr's store in VT), built in late 1800. One very helpful fellow from What's This Font? suggested the sign was probably done by hand, and rather poorly at that!   \n  \nJust need an approxomation for a family reunion next month.   \n   \nThank's for any and all assistance.   \n   \nPenny ![Store sign from late1880](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121164026im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40389.jpg)\n\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; Tangles - Randumhouse {Mike Y}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121164026/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5577 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Army Men dingbat? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121164026/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5474 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
