  "content": "I’m having problems with a few files that are being sent to me by a customer. They are PDF’s that have everything embedded but I’m unable to make any edits with the fonts they used. When I try I get a warning that says I cannot edit that font. The customer told me which fonts to buy - FuturaStd1 library and BodoniStd1 library— As it turns out these are OpenType fonts that I purchased from Adobe. The problem is that the customer is using the TrueType version and they are not showing up as available in my library.\n\nAm I stuck with buying the TrueType version now? Or is there something in distiller that will make those fonts editable?\n\nThanks in advance, Dave\n\n",

      "content": "1. “TrueType” is also OpenType. OpenType encompasses two font formats: OpenType PS (.otf) and OpenType TT (.ttf). The latter was formerly known as TrueType. So what you’re talking is the distinction between OpenType PS and OpenType TT / TrueType.\n\n2. Fonts named “Futura Std” or “Bodoni Std” were never sold in the OpenType TT / TrueType format. They’re only available in the OpenType PS format.\n\n3. There are many versions of Futura and Bodoni available from many vendors (Adobe, Bitstream, Linotype, Bitstream, URW, Monotype/ITC and others), both in OpenType TT / TrueType and in OpenType PS format. Some permit editable embedding, some only permit read-only embedding (aka “print & preview”). This has nothing to do with the font format.\n\nSo what you’re looking for is not a font in either OT TT or OT PS but a font with a license for editable embedding.\n\nRegards,  \nA.\n\n"

My understanding of the Adobe EULA is that conversion is allowed and that the customer can provide the converted fonts to you, and you’re allowed to use them udner the license you purchsed for the OpenType PS versions from Adobe.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n\\*excluding the web type pack released in 1998.\n\n"

Does that sound right? So I need to go back and buy the OpenTypeTT fonts right? And then I need to make sure that my customer is using a font license that allows editing by a different user.
