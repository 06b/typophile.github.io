If the the proof is printed and not digital we have them intial and date each printed proof as well.\n\nHildebrant.\n\n [‹ AIGA article - The Digital Past: When Typefaces Were Experimental](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111030721/http:/typophile.com/node/12578 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Post Count ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111030721/http:/typophile.com/node/12170 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Approval forms are good intentions but when deadlines come up and key players can’t be found the work goes out the door signed or unsigned. The thinking is it can always be changed at the service bureau or printer.\n\n"
