Just like the Galgo, the letters of this font are a mix of elegant brush calligraphy and the rough, weathered strokes of speedy scrawl. Galgo Script is quite suitable for logomarks, titles, short headlines and lengthy artistic passages. Drawn by Angel Koziupa and expanded and digitized by Alejandro Paul, Galgo Script was created due to the demand for this kind of “rushed brush”.\n\nVisit **[Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012064315/http:/www.sudtipos.com/)** to find our complete catalogue of fonts\n\n",
