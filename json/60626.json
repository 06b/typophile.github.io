It has a number of alternates, including the circular ‘G’ with horizontal bar, and the ‘Q’ with the centered vertical cauda.  \nFor ‘Normandie’, [Block Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010192825/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/red_rooster_collection/block_gothic_bold_condensed/?&sample_text=NORMANDIE) is the closest font I could find.  \nF\n\n"
