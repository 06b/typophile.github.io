My problem is that the guy that made the logo used some random logo generator on a web site and then had a stroke and doesn't remember anything...\n\nThe video company is trying to match up the logo. I need to buy the font (if I need to buy one). I just need to get the right one.\n\nHere is where the logo is: worldwidesolutionz.com\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108184755im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo%20(1)_3994.png)\n\nThanks for any help!!\n\nLarry\n\n",
