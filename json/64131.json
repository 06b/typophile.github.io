Also i think the book text in the second pic is Minion Pro - can anyone confirm?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Untitled-1 copy.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20091114124929/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1%20copy_1.jpg) | 620.98 KB |\n| [Untitled-5 copy.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20091114124929/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-5%20copy.jpg) | 565.81 KB |\n\n",

Maybe there is another variation of this typeface?\n\n—- Tamas Ferencz —-\n\n"
