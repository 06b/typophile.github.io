      "content": "I'm sure Ken Lunde will have excellent suggestions. As far as Cantonese goes, there is no real typographical difference as far as I am aware apart from some characters specific to Cantonese.\n\nThe standard written Chinese used by Cantonese speakers in formal situations is essentially identical to that used by Mandarin speakers. When Cantonese speakers specifically choose to write in Cantonese, the differences with standard written Chinese based on Mandarin are basically in word choice and usage, but as I said, the only typographically different element is the use of Cantonese-specific characters.\n\nAnother thing to take into consideration is that in Hong Kong and Macao, Cantonese speakers will write with traditional characters, while Cantonese speakers in China will write with simplified characters.\n\n"

She might be doing some work for Hong Kong, so I thought I'd see if there was anything that would be helpful as she studied design in the UK and isn't that familiar with Chinese typography and fonts.\n\nThanks again,\n\nGraham\n\n"
