If anyone has suggestions on what to use or where to find such a typeface, I would love it.\n\nThank you!\n\n [‹ CV Feedback please](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706221935/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42547 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [alan fletcher quote wanted please ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706221935/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42587 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

From that list you’ll start finding visual clues. For instance you might find the word “bars” if you think of a prison. Bars are tall and thin. Word play is a great exercise, but don’t start by trying to find the typeface. First give yourself a salad bar of words to work from.\n\n"
