Namely, typefaces that use long, thin lines with a sort of ornate or disturbing quality. I’m quite confident I’m going to have to create a custom font for this project but I could use some inspiration!\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Type and design on website](http://web.archive.org/web/20070824231802/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33701 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Curse of the Typophile ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070824231802/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34951 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
