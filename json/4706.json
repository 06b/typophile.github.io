  "content": "This is not an identification request, but is very pertinent to Type ID ...   \n   \nCheck out Fonts.com's monthly [Type Trading Cards](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826045005/http:/www.fonts.com/fontent/fontent_home.asp?nCo=AFMT&con=articles&sec=tradingcard). They include   \nhistory of a typeface and ID hints. Cool! Hope it lasts awhile.   \n   \nUseless, perhaps, to you experts, but useful and FUN for some of   \nthe rest of us.\n\n",

      "content": "Neat idea.   \n   \nOne little nit to pick: The Bembo card states that Bembo was \"Released in 1495 by Aldus Manutius.\" I think this inaccurate and misleading.   \n   \nFirst of all, Aldus' typeface was not called \"Bembo.\" That's the name Monotype gave _their_ version in 1922. It comes from the name of an author of a book printed by Aldus (_De Aetna,_ by Pietro Bembo, published by Aldus in 1495).   \n   \nSecond, he didn't \"release\" it in the sense that we mean today. Aldus was a 15th century printer in Florence, Italy. Several types were cut for his use by Francesco Griffo. \"Bembo\" is a modern revival of one of them. It was never made available to the general public in Aldus' day the way fonts are today.\n\n"
