Adobe's [Caflisch Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051405/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?Image=ADT0002937) has similar mannerisms too.\n\n"

The shape of the letters is identical. Thickness and slope are mere touches of buttons in Illustrator, but the letterforms are what make the case to me.\n\n"

Will you concede that the shapes and proportions of the letters are the same? Look at the counters in the a and e, and the angles of the connectors. Even the spur on the top of the a is the same. It almost looks to me like the sample was done on an inkjet and there was some spreading of the ink that blurred some of the edge details, like the top of the t's.\n\n"
