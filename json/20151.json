It was a few minutes long and featured interviews of Steven Heller and Jonathan Hoefler. It was predictably shallow, but fairly well informed. It reminded me a bit of the famous Erik Speikermann \" [Typomania](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018234758/http:/www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C1097932338/E1823448250/index.html)\" video (but without the Tom Tom Club music).\n\nI don't normally watch this program, but my parents do and thoughtfully TIVOed it for me so I could see it. I checked the CBS website and they don't have the item viewable online.\n\n",

And then we'd have to start all over again the next time she called because she immediately forgot it all. I don't remember why, but at one point, she decided to switch to a PC that offered unlimited free phone support. That was one case when I was happy when someone switched from the Mac, but I feel sorry for the phone support people at Gateway.\n\n"
