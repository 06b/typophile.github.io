      "content": "I think that the capital letters are inherently modular unless they’re drawn in certain calligraphic styles. But that’s another story…\n\nModular in the context of Fontstruct is not the same as modular in the context of Fontlab or other font editors. I can construct modular letters in Fontlab and still have fine control over kerning, sidebearings, OT features, etc. that just don’t exist in the modular world of Fontstruct. That kind of stuff adds days or weeks of effort to a font and is what separates the free stuff from the pay stuff.\n\nTo paraphrase Leslie Cabarga, the difference between a free font and a pay font is about six weeks.\n\n"

And James makes a good distinction about how the word \"modular\" is used within FontStruct and outside of it.\n\n"
