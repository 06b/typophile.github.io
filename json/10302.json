Monotype released this font in 1956 under the name Californian and Tony Stan (1917-1988) designed the ITC version, Berkeley. This clear, legible font gives text a   \nclassic, elegant look.   \n   \nFrom FB:   \n   \nIn 1958, Lanston issued it as Californian. Carol Twombly digitized the roman 30 years later for California (magazine); David Berlow revised it for Font Bureau with italic and small caps; Jane Patterson designed the bold. In 1999, assisted by Richard Lipton & Jill Pichotta, Berlow designed the black and the text and display series\n\n"
