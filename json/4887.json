Call me soulless but I really love that family. Anyone have thoughts on which set would be better?   \n   \nare there any font collections that are similar?\n\n",

If you need these, you may like to consider Linotype. I got both sets (LT and bitstream).\n\n"

Stand out to whom?   \n   \nPersonally, and I know this goes against the grain of current practice, but I'd rather have less rather than more fonts, or at least, a trusted few well thought out, technically proficient fonts, whose look I also happen to like, and whose text setting capability saves me a lot of time and money (by forgoing adjustments to letterform combinations, etc.).   \n   \nSo my recommendation would not be to go the CD route, as you also suggest, but for perhaps different reasons. In writing about the selection of metal types, Lewis Allen, in his book Printing with the Handpress, suggested selection after careful study, as \"inferior tools corrode the spirit.\" Always kind of favored that remark.\n\n"
