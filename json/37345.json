  "content": "The newest edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary boasts some 16,000 changes, all pertaining to the hyphen. It has either been omitted and the words left as two separate entities (ice cream), or the two words have been joined into one (pigeonhole). The AP is running a story which blames the internet and cell phones; and modern design.\n\n\"Another factor in the hyphen's demise is designers' distaste for its ungainly horizontal bulk between words.\"\n\nSo what do you think, typophiles? Is the hyphen dated and unattractive or just misunderstood by an eager-to-communicate generation?\n\nThe AP story can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014143514/http:/news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070921/od_nm/britain_hyphen1_dc;_ylt=ArHzlsg3leMV5A86tgZvZuqs0NUE).\n\n",

Hyphenates were a fashion that failed to stick, and hanging on to them can be pretentious.\n\nI also agree with Nick—hyphenated phrases are a good way to identify words used as a group adjectivally. They’re especially useful for making hasty internet communication more comprehensible.\n\n"

The second thing I do when preparing a text provided by an author for setting is to search and replace spacehyphenspace to spaceenspace (I know this a British use, presumably something similar is required to accommodate other uses); the first is to replace double word spaces. The main concern for designers is, I believe, the other use of hyphens – to break a word over two lines and to avoid ladders.\n\n\\*5. Typogr. An excessively wide space between two words.
