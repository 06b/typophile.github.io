  "content": "I'm very early in my process, but I want to have some conversation to help get the juices flowing.\n\nThis is a logo for a cabinetmaker who does a wide range of high end pieces: humidors, large dining tables, custom desks, built-ins, kitchens, etc. His designs range from staid, traditional pieces, to art deco and ultra-modern. His process involves the collaboration with many shops, so he has dubbed his brand, \"Whelan Artisans.\" He wants to give the idea of traditional craft that is also forward-looking and sustainable, and suggested two whales in a circle formation.\n\nHere is my initial treatment. He liked Garamond, although I have my misgivings about it. Also, I modeled the animal after a blue whale, although I'm thinking a humpback might be more dramatic. I haven't invested a huge amount of time, but I would like some initial impressions. And don't be bashful about ripping into it. That's why I'm posting it - to be refined in the typophile fire.\n\n- Nick\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100503172706im_/http:/typophile.com/files/whelan_arisans_logo2_4614.png)\n\n",

If so, how?\n\nAs is, the lack of line-weight changes in the whales bothers me - looks computer-y and decidedly unartisanal. However, if it's meant to be an outline for carving into wood, that's a different story.\n\nThe big W bothers me, especially with the logomark - the styles of the mark and the logotype seem way to different.\n\nSo... Whales? Whelan? Is that the connection?\n\nThanks for sharing your logo-in-process!\n\n"

      "content": "First off, thank you everyone for your very helpful comments.\n\n@eeblet: Your advice for working with line weights is well taken. I started from a sketch, but midway through the digital process I did sense that humpback whales might be better and if this direction turned out to be garbage, I didn't want to have spent precious time fine-tuning lines for a direction I would ultimately abandon. Also, the whale : Whelan link is coincidental; should I steer the client away from what may possibly come across as a hackneyed phonemic association?\n\n@Paul, BigWave: Basically, the client really likes whales, and he's kind of a crunchy, Grateful Dead type of guy. I think it suits his personality well, and since partly he's selling himself with this logo, I think it fits. His shop is in Northern California (about 2 hours north of San Francisco) and there is a considerable amount of whale-watching in the coastal part of the county, so I think the whales make sense geographically as well.\n\n@ellason: Yeah, I notice the goofy smile, too. If you ask me, that's the problem with these damned porpoises; (to me, at least) they all look like that have a stupid grin. Again, another reason to try out a humpback whale, since they have less of a scoopy, smiley thing going on up front.\n\nI'll return once I integrate and elaborate.\n\n--  \nNick Hladek\n\n"

I like the fact that you aren't using a wood plane or other similar item for a wood worker's logo. I also like having two whales since you are talking about more than one person. I don't like the type choice. I think it is too stiff for an artisan, especially the W. I think the questions about how this will be used are important - wood cuts? letterpress?\n\nSharon\n\n"

Something more humanist or even hippy-ish (just a tad - no Hobo) would make the whales more sensical.\n\nI am excited to see what you come up with!
