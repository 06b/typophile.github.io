The Book weight specifically is quite good. At some point, if there is demand and interest, I will revise the font family, and do better. (The same applies for Apex Sans, which is presently undergoing a serious and necessary revision, and is going to be MUCH better...)\n\n"

      "content": "I think the problem with the heavier weights of Apex is that it attempts to remain truly monoline, and keep the weight of that monoline the same for all characters. So the heavy weights suffer from the lack of optical compensation at stroke intersections, and not doing lighter strokes in characters with a high stroke density.\n\nI like the underlying design and the lighter weights, though, and I am sure that Chester could salvage the heavier weights with a bit more work.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
