I’ve had a look about but couldn’t find any further reference of or a digitised version.\n\nDoes anyone know if a digitised version of Madelaine is available?\n\nThanks,\n\nDom\n\n [‹ (x) \"Trading pty ltd\" western-style block face - Playbill {Yves}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080521092629/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18521 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Lust - The Erotic Dance Party\" logo - Serpentine {Lex} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080521092629/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18543 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
