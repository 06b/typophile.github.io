I’ve looked through the Flickr group here: [http://www.flickr.com/groups/type\\_specimen/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234410/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/type_specimen/ \"http://www.flickr.com/groups/type\\_specimen/\") but I’m really interested in more contemporary designs, not just showing the character set or Lorem ipsum. Typefaces don’t matter I’m just looking for the variety and different techniques (phrases vs. single words per line vs. story telling).\n\n [‹ this is the font that I want (almost)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234410/http:/typophile.com/node/19787 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Car / Road / Traveling, etc. Font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234410/http:/typophile.com/node/19754 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I think that the best place to get them is to download them directly from the foundry’s/type designer’s website. My [del.icio.us/typefoundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234410/http:/del.icio.us/geoffriding/typefoundry) tag if you need links to their websites. I hope this helps.\n\n"

What I’m really looking for is more extensive samples like Mark has on his website ie. [http://ms-studio.com/FontSales/goldenbook.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234410/http:/ms-studio.com/FontSales/goldenbook.html \"http://ms-studio.com/FontSales/goldenbook.html\") .
