  "content": "I can't get my TrueType fonts to kern properly in CS3.\n\nSet to 'metrics' in CS3 the kerning is effectively removed.\n\nI discovered if I moved my fonts out of FontXplorer or Suitcase and activated them in Font Book then kerning would work again.\n\nAnyone else encountered this problem? I'm now at a loss how to manage my fonts properly.\n\n",
