He was an the intimate friend of William Morris,  \nPhilip Webb and Bernard Shaw, and a significant figure in the wider Arts  \nand Crafts and socialist movements. These aspects of his life are still  \nevident at 7 Hammersmith Terrace, his home for the last 30 years of his  \nlife. The talk offers an introduction to Walker’s life and a look at his  \nhome which, with its William Morris, Cotswold and North African  \nfurnishings, is the best-preserved Arts and Crafts interior in Britain.\n\nAileen Reid works for English Heritage as an historian on the Survey  \nof London, the official history of London’s streets and buildings. Since  \n2001 she has also been curator at 7 Hammersmith Terrace, where she  \ncatalogued the contents and oversaw the opening of the house to the  \npublic for the first time in 2005.\n\n[http://stbride.org/event/theuniversalsamaritan](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829235615/http:/stbride.org/event/theuniversalsamaritan \"http://stbride.org/event/theuniversalsamaritan\")\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\nStay up to date with our events feed  \n [http://stbride.org/events\\_education/events.rss](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829235615/http:/stbride.org/events_education/events.rss \"http://stbride.org/events\\_education/events.rss\")\n\n",
