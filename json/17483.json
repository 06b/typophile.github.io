  "content": "Hi\n\nI have been racking my brains over this one, but can’t come to any conclusions. I need to license a text typeface for a company that facilitates tax pooling transactions. As the transactions will be web based, I feel that it needs to be clean, serious and contemporary but not too bland and lifeless. I am thinking sans, but will not rule out a serif. The typeface will be used for printed collateral and possibly a little bit for screen, but not at tiny resolutions. Any suggestions will be gratefully received!\n\nKris.\n\n [‹ vintage style travel poster](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060117/http:/typophile.com/node/17500 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Libra sans ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060117/http:/typophile.com/node/17506 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

We need a typeface to use for the printed collateral, and possibly the web-site.\n\nHope that clarifies the situation!\n\n"
