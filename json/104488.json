Do you know whether HI will publish Fiedler Baroque Gothic 9 in the near future?  \nI have not seen a complete specimen, but am I right in assuming that the fox-tail terminals, as shown in the sample, are also used for the uppercase and numerals?  \nThanks  \nDon\n\n"

Apparently all Photo-Lettering published in the way of specimens was a big book of one line phrases, each composed in a different design, that regular purchasers could use to order from. Also, I seem to recall seeing such a book in a university library a few years ago.  \nThis is just a guess, based on the 1963 book cover and your comment, that a Fox-tail Gothic design inspired by Fiedler Baroque Gothic 9 would use fox-tail terminals for:  \n• 2 3[top and bottom] 5 6 6 9  \n• C[top and bottom] G[top] J Q S[top and bottom]  \n• a c[top and bottom] e f j q r[book title shows ball terminal but I find it discordant] s[top and bottom] t y.  \n• $[top and bottom] & ?  \nDoes any of this look out of place? Did I miss some -- perhaps K k R?  \nDon\n\n"

It showed only one ball or semi-ball terminal -- the r -- but I now see that there are actually quite a few of them.  \nDon\n\n"
