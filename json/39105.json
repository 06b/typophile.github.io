I’m seriously impressed - it easily out performs Illustrator’s Live Trace by a factor of lots.\n\nI couldn’t find a mention here and if this is old news, I apologise. Sod it, no I don’t, go and have a look, it’s fantastic. :)\n\ns\n\n [‹ What a cop out](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906232449/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42203 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type Link... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906232449/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42352 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
