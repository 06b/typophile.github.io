  "content": "I would welcome any feedback on the attached logo(type), I am looking for some opinion on letterspacing, ideally I'd like to keep the logo the same length as it is already. Also any suggestions as to supportive typefaces for use in corporate literature and electronic documents (internal email etc). The company, Greencell, supply avocados, kiwi fruits and like to reatil outlet Waitrose amongst others and are very happy with what they have seen so far (the result as attached) so not a lot can change, it's now at the fine tuning stage. All comments positive and negative will be greatly appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [greencell.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018115008/http:/typophile.com/files/greencell.jpg) | 59.03 KB |\n| [greencell.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018115008/http:/typophile.com/files/greencell.pdf) | 305.3 KB |\n\n",

They feel too short to me, by just a little bit, particularly in respect to the other letters. Adjusting the kerning like Tim suggested may help. I understand the desire to keep the overal wordmark compact, but it bugs my eye.\n\n"

There is also the intention for the icon disappear at smaller sizes to reinforce the g being read as a g. I would post a sample but I am at home. p.s I am Lumo at work, LMcat at home.\n\n"
