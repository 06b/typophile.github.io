At any rate, this is less off-topic than birdhouse carpentry [ahem], so here goes:\n\nI use Acrobat Pro 7, and often need to use the \"Print with comments summary\" feature. This always launches with paper size set to \"letter\" and layout set to \"Document and comments with sequence numbers on separate pages\". But I _always_ want \"A4\" and \"Document and comments with connector lines on single pages\". Anybody know if there's a way I can make this the default? Some preferences file or suchlike?\n\n[If anybody's thinking, \"Why not ask an Adobe question in the Adobe user forums?\", the answer is that I _did_, in _October_; since I got diddly response I thought I'd try elsewhere.]\n\n",

Besides, if it had been as simple as that, someone at the Adobe forum would've said so, surely!\n\n"

What I was hoping for was something that would change the default so that I wouldn't _have_ to go into these settings dialogs every time.\n\nEven the wording of the help file tells you to set the layout options you want when you go into the 'Summarize Comments' or 'Print with comments summary; menu items, suggesting that there isn't a way to have _pre-set_ the layout options that you know you're going to want every time.\n\nGrrr.\n\n"
