The I, E, & K seem quite different. I've found a bunch of similar fonts (\"Aerotype Durandal Flat\", \"Piranha\" by Nathan Caldecott, \"Identikal Rally\", \"Identikal Rebirth\", \"FF Aircraft\"), but no exact matches.\n\nAlso, how would one classify this font? A \"chamfered angular square sans-serif\"?\n\n\\*\\*\\* Bonus points if anyone can confirm whether the \"2011\" on the poster is even in the same font? \\*\\*\\*\n\nThanks in advance! :D\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [green\\_lantern\\_-\\_teaser\\_poster\\_font\\_-\\_1a-(already\\_on\\_wtf).png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819020910/http:/typophile.com/files/green_lantern_-_teaser_poster_font_-_1a-(already_on_wtf).png) | 45.22 KB |\n| [green\\_lantern\\_-\\_teaser\\_poster\\_font\\_-\\_2a.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819020910/http:/typophile.com/files/green_lantern_-_teaser_poster_font_-_2a.png) | 25.01 KB |\n\n",

It also remains unsolved on [WhatTheFont Forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819020910/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=lantern). So, 2 possibilities: totally hand-drawn from scratch or customization from an existing typeface (what I prefer, less frustrating ;). Sweet Square is also the closest I've found but some details you've already spotted remain off (but not hard to reproduce). It also shares many similarities with [United](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819020910/http:/typophile.com/wiki/www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection), [KP Duty](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819020910/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/kp-duty) and [Full Block](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819020910/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/fullblock.php) but none of these ones are matching either.\n\n"

My completely uninformed guess would be that they took an existing font (like Durandal Flat) and modified it for the movie. But since I didn't work on that one, I can't say for certain. Sorry, wish I could be more help.\n\n"
