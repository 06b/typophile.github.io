The last time this   \nhappened, a post to Typo-L succeeded in getting through to you,   \nbut this time that hasn't worked either, so I am now trying this   \nforum, hoping to get a refund on Serif, which has not shipped an   \nissue in about three years.   \n   \nThis past September you wrote on Typo-L: \"I'll give refunds to   \nthe impatient\"\\*. I declared myself as impatient and asked for a   \nrefund. I was advised on September 26 that the refund has been   \nissued but it would take upto two billing cycles. It's now been   \nabout four cycles, and still nothing. Could you please let me   \nknow what to expect? Is there perhaps some information   \nI could throw at my bank?   \n   \n\\* [http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0209&L=typo-l&D=0&T=0&P=12097](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021234811/http:/listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0209&L=typo-l&D=0&T=0&P=12097)   \n   \nSincerely,   \nHrant Papazian   \n   \n   \nRef: [http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/2509.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021234811/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/2509.html)\n\n",
