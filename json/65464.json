Wikipedia’s page on the lozenge seems to think so, for instance.\n\nIn modal logic, the modality ’possibility’ is represented by the diamond shape, while ’necessity’ is represented by the box shape. Typographic preference would be for both symbols to be square-like, and you can see this from the above example. So the traditionally narrow lozenge would not be the best fit for this symbol.\n\nIndeed, in LaTeX, \\Diamond and \\Box are usually used for these symbols. \\Diamond comes from the LaTeX symbol font and is a square diamond. The best match in Unicode might be ◇ ’White Diamond’ U+25C7. The \\lozenge is separate in LaTeX, available from the AMS symbols package.\n\nMy guess is that modal logicians have been using the square diamond symbol without ever meaning it to be a ’lozenge’, but their similarity has led to some confusion, or at least some imperfect solutions where lozenges are substituted when a proper square diamond symbol is missing. I think Wikipedia is wrong here; I see no reason at all to call the ’possibility’ symbol a lozenge. It’s not that lozenges are traditionally narrow but modal logicians like them square, but rather that modal logicians use a square diamond symbol that is somewhat similar in appearance but is a different character from the lozenge.\n\nSeparately, in axiomatic logic, there is something called diamondsuit that is represented by ♢, the ’White Diamond Suit’ U+2662, as in the card symbol. There’s also the clubsuit, represented by ♣.\n\n"

Then TeX would call up the right symbol font to supply these symbols.

This glyph is not meant to be width compatible with anything but a lozenge, which by definition is uncomfortably narrow. It’s also, like all math, only somewhat weight compatible. As you can imagine, this glyph doesn’t get “ultra”, and maintain it’s vertical alignment, and it’s not alone among math signs that can only get so bold and stay aligned.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>I don’t know what you mean by traditional lozenge shape?</cite>\n\nGood point. I wasn’t clear about this, and didn’t think it clearly through in my head either when I wrote that.\n\n’Traditional’ probably wasn’t the best word. What I meant was the shape we conventionally think of when we think of lozenges, and I don’t confine myself to typographic lozenges here (although a quick check through the fonts on my computer show a range of about 50 to 80 degrees, with around 60 degrees being the typical angle). Do an image search of ’lozenge’ and see what kinds of shapes turn up. Something between 60 and even 90 degrees is typical.\n\nIf we make a lozenge 3/4 of the cap height _and_ make it 45 degrees, it will be quite small. Below, Georgia’s original lozenge is shown on the left and a 45-degree 3/4-of-cap-height lozenge that I quickly threw together is shown on the right, so you can appreciate the difference. Sure, I could have employed some tricks to make the new lozenge appear larger, and Georgia’s wide design arguably calls for a wider lozenge than usual, but I think this will do to illustrate my point.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103035155im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Georgialozenges_6228.gif)\n\nI don’t think of the lozenge as a mathematical symbol, by the way. As I said before, I am of the opinion that the diamond-shaped mathematical symbols used in some specialized branches of mathematical logic are not typographical lozenges, but either a diamond that looks like a square rhombus or a diamond suit. Ideally, these should get appropriate typographical treatment (using special sorts for instance) and not be lazily substituted with typographical lozenges you find in most fonts.\n\nThe typographical lozenge, as I take it, is a sort of generic symbol without such rigid expectations on its shape, like bullets. So the Microsoft Character Design Standards are a rough guideline only, and the designs where the lozenges reach cap height are not breaking some inviolable rule. Its width is not completely independent of the design, as I mentioned in connection with the Georgia sample above. Note that the Microsoft Character Design Standards also state that the advance width of the lozenge should be proportional to the design.\n\n"

Or were you questioning whether Georgia’s lozenge was a true lozenge or not? Before this thread, I wouldn’t even have thought to question that...\n\nThe second lozenge has exactly the same height as the original Georgia lozenge; it was mechanically modified from the original glyph only in the horizontal dimension to make it narrower while maintaining the same outline width. I have marked the sample below to show that this height is indeed around 3/4 of the cap height. Georgia has a large x height compared to the cap height, so this does turn out to be close to the small cap height. Maybe I should have chosen a different font, but I only picked the one serif font I assumed everyone was familiar with, being the font used for Typophile and all.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103035155im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Georgialozengesmarked_4109.gif)\n\nNow, on the 45-degree business, it seems that at least one technical definition of the lozenge is that of ’an equilateral parallelogram whose acute angles are 45 degrees’. The definition comes from [MathWorld](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103035155/http:/mathworld.wolfram.com/Lozenge.html). It is immediately followed by the statement, ’Sometimes, the restriction to 45 degrees is dropped, and it is required only that two opposite angles are acute and the other two obtuse’.\n\nI did not know about this 45-degree requirement before. And to repeat what I said before, I think in popular usage no such requirement is in force, so that a range of 50-80 degrees is typical. Perhaps whoever put in the 45-degree requirement for the typographical lozenge on Wikipedia had the stricter technical definition in mind, assuming (wrongly, I think) that this also applied to typographical tradition.\n\n"
