If this is for babies, you might want to soften it up a bit, cause it kinda wants to kill me.   \nContext is key.   \nThough it does look good.   \n   \nAaron\\</font\\>   \n   \n   \n   \noh man, that would be an AWESOME concert!\n\n"

What I'm really concerned with is trying to figure out the \"logic\" of the letters and how they relate to each other. I want to make sure all of the letters follow the same rules and look like they came from the same typeface - that is, of course, except for the capital \"B\" and \"S\".   \n   \nThe client is a design agency and they want the logo to look like a cigar box logo - not for kids!\n\n"
