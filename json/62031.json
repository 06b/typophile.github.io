My intuition says it's named Hot Dog, but it isn't the Hot Dog that's out there now.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318013535im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SCN_hotdog_3867.jpg)\n\n",

I know I need to keep the look of this font, this client is very fussy about that. Luckily it is very geometric and the client doesn't have high production values. I used a scan and duplicated letters, and only needed one, K, which I made. Not the most typophilic solution, but it got it out the door! Thanks everybody for your knowledge, it helped me make a decision on what to do next!\n\n"
