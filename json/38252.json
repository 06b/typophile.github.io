  "content": "For the life of me I can't find any difference between these three versions of EF/SG's Europa Grotesk, Europa Grotesk No. 1, and Europa Grotesk No. 2, other than stroke thicknesses. Any help? Each version seems to be a modest variation on Akzidenz Grotesk, AG Old Face, and/or Helvetica. This does not concern the headline vs. text versions of their fonts, so I link to just the SH versions of them below.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-sh/dem-bol/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302160540/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-sh/dem-bol/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-sh/dem-bol/\")\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-1-sh/med/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302160540/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-1-sh/med/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-1-sh/med/\")\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-2-sh/bol/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302160540/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-2-sh/bol/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-2-sh/bol/\")\n\n",
