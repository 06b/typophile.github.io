  "content": "There was a discussion recently on the Arabic word for \"Font\" these were suggested:  \nحرف مطبعي1  \nخط مطبعي2  \nحرف طباعي3  \n خط طباعي4  \nبنط5  \nI like No. 1 because حرف is an individual letter as an independent unit, while خط suggests a script. Which do you prefer? What other technical terms related to typography have multiple Arabic names or are not yet properly defined? For example light, bold, condensed etc. You are invited to discuss these matters here, or to post your lists of suggested Arabic typography terms.\n\n",

      "content": "IMHO ḫaṭṭ ṭibāʿī [khatt tibaa`ii] خَطّْ طِبَاعِی (typographic script) is an accurate term for \"typeface\", since it describes the result, just like typeface does.\n\nThe term bunṭ [bunt] بُنْطْ, on the other hand, is an accurate description of \"font\", since it refers to an aspect of typographic craftmanschip. \"Font\" is a corruption of the older \"fount\". the result of founding molten lead. Bunṭ بُنْطْ can hardly be Arabic or even Semitic (although the absense of an etymological dictionary of Arabic remains embarassing), as can be inferred by the absence of any other derivations of the BNT root within Arabic, as well as the complete absence of the BNT root anywhere else in Semitic languages. Rather, it appears to be the word \"point\", \"punkt\". \"punto\" or even \"punt\" as a European term of size in typography.\n\nPS - this web site should support Unicode! My Arabic transcription appears to be clobbered by this font.\n\nThomas Milo  \nDecoType  \n [www.decotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414211052/http:/www.decotype.com/ \"www.decotype.com\")\n\n"

In the metal-type days there also was the use of الصندوق المطبعي 'the type box' i.e. the complete set of different [][][] where [][][] would be the name of those little metal things Gutenberg invented!\n\nYes Tom I recall the use of بنط to mean point size for example \"12 بنط\".\n\n"

      "content": "I am for either of خط طباعي or بنط\n\nI prefer بنط because I would like to use one word not two, and I can pluralize it easily. I agree with Tom's and Vladimir's explanations that بنط must have been derived from \"point\" as in point size. But this should not matter as even in Latin the popular word \"font\" used today was only referring to a specific point size of a type before taking over in the terms type or typeface after computers, and therefore it is not an accurate term in its current usage. Arguments constantly flare about it and other terms.\n\nOne can argue, if we can Arabize \"point\" for font, why not Arabize the word \"font\" itself. Using فونت or فونط would then be equally valid. Here is what I would use to translate the terms:\n\nFont: خط طباعي or بنط\n\nFonts: خطوط طباعية or ابناط\n\nType: خط طباعي or بنط\n\nTypeface خط طباعي or بنط\n\nTypes Style نمط الخط الطباعي or النمط الحرفي\n\nFont Family عائلة الخط الطباعي or عائلة الابناط\n\nType Family عائلة الخط الطباعي or عائلة الابناط\n\n-Saad\n\n"

I think Arabic has a good word for \"point size\", which is حجم . Why not using it instead? Those who originally used بنط for size did not need to just as the Gulf Arabs today use فليت instead of شريحة!!\n\nBut since بنط is used any way and فونت is not Arabic anyway, I think بنط can be used OK. As for how to pronounce it, just add it to the many Arabic words that must remembered without diacritic vowels.\n\nٍ  \n\\>\\>So, the could term of Font is “الحرف الطباعي”.\n\nYou meat الخط الطباعي as الحرف الطباعي is not accurate or informative term.\n\n-Saad\n\n"
