  "content": "I'm considering purchasing either Skolar or Mokka, but considering the price of four basic styles will run me, I want to be certain before I buy. I've looked at online specimens of both, but in the past, I've fount that what may look great in that setting, or even in downloaded PDF specimens, ends up looking awful on-screen in Microsoft Word. (Might this be because I'm using Windows, and perhaps these typefaces were designed largely by Mac users for Mac users?)\n\nI'm not looking for free fonts, or to rip off foundries. What I'm hoping is that someone might be willing to set the attached word document (at least I think it's attached) in either Mokka or Skolar (ideally both, if you can), and embed the fonts so that they'll appear when I open the document. That way, I'll be able to see what they'll look like in actual use, without getting additional access to them before buying. (my email is [mikebaranowski@gmail.com](mailto:mikebaranowski@gmail.com))\n\nThanks so much in advance to anyone willing to help me out. I know it's asking a lot, and I appreciate your assistance.\n\nMichael\n\n",

I get that there's no real financial incentive to catering to the very small group of folks in my situation, but it sure would be nice to be able to purchase some fonts that display as nicely in the application I use all the time as they do in print.\n\n"

Thanks Simon.\n\nThe fact that you don’t like the PDF rendering, suggests that like many Windows users your preference has been tuned to crisp rendering of Windows and Office bundled fonts like Calibri and Cambria under Windows “GDI rendering”. These TrueType based OpenType fonts have had a level of hinting investment that few third-party font vendors can justify. Occasionally corporate clients, looking to roll out a corporate font across thousands of desktops, might be willing to invest in having a font hinted, but typically for font vendors selling to graphic designers (who are happy with the way Adobe apps render type) would have no need to. So really you have three options, live with the rendering, pick different fonts, or pay to have the fonts hinted.\n\n"

Maybe I've become too accustomed to using warm, flowing faces like Dolly or Feijoa, but there's something rather jarring and distracting about Skolar when set at these sizes. I don't think it's appropriate for setting long running text, at least not at 10-11 points. The Skolar specimen pdf has it set smaller, I think, and it seems to work.\n\nIt shines as a web or display font, however. Go figure.\n\n"
