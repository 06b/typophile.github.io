Let's suppose r = 1 and b = φ, then m² = φ² - 1², but since φ² - 1² = φ then m = √φ.\n\nIt also follows from this that if you have a series of weights 35, 45, 55, 65, 75 and 85 (where 55 is regular and 75 is bold) that the thickness of 75 = the thickness of 35 + the thickness of 55; and the thickness of 85 = the thickness of 45 + the thickness of 65.\n\nYou've got to love maths.

No formula can replace the eye. And there are many glyph specific & style specific issues all of which must trump the formula in specific areas. The hyper bold & the hyper thin also impose their own agendas. The hyper thin are difficult because of point placement issues and the hyper bold must be distorted beautifully/grotesquely in ways that the formula doesn't help with at all. AND if you have a font which is screen specific or is meant to be used in a particular media that may trump the value of the formula again - to the point where it may not be useful anymore.\n\nI rememeber the excitement I felt at starting to get ahold of this pattern! Anyway, what I mean to say is I hope this doesn't feel like cold water. I will try to find the thread.\n\n"

Since I am not focused on sans and am not totally convinced about the formulas, I was not concerned that much with the actual formulas.\n\nHe started out by saying that if you to the most obvious thing, and add a certain fixed amount to each width to get the next heavier weight, it will look wrong. The problem is that then that if you have a series of say 3 weights, then the ratio of a the lightest to b the middle will be different from the ratio of b to c. To look good, he thinks, you want the ratios of a to b and b to c need to be the same.\n\nThat idea is the basis of his formula on the web site. He has generalized that formula to a formula that gives you the relative weights of n interpolated weights, given the extremes.\n\nBut he also has a formula for how the horizontals should vary along with the verticals, depending on whether the glyph has 1 (T) 2 (D) 3 (E) or 4 (@) horizontals.\n\n"

An exercise left to the student :)\n\nThe stuff about horizontals introduces new ideas, though, so there's new information there. I also didn't get that so clearly. I probably heard the same talk as Karsten, and it flew by pretty fast, and I wasn't even trying to take notes.\n\nI did get the problem he is addressing with his formulas, though. If you have a lower case c, and fatten the horizontals a certain amount, then try to apply the same to a lower case e, you are going to get into trouble on heavier weights because the counters will start to get too small and clott up. So if you want a rule, then you are going to have to include the number of horizontals as a variable.\n\nAs to my own perspective, I am personally concerned more with the question of needed contrast between regular and bold, and in the adjustment of optical sizes, as I haven't yet focused on the multi-weight family.\n\nBut to get back to Nick Job's original post, the number of 52% bolder seems to me may be misleading. It might be that this is too much for a bold weight in a serif font that is going to match with text, eg as a side head. And maybe too little for a headline.\n\nFor example, Minion semi-bold n stem is 39% wider than the regular. The Minion bold is 62% greater than the regular. With Times the bold is 65% greater than the regular. If you average the weights of the bold and semi-bold of Minion, you get 50.5%, close to your number, but I am concerned that this may not work well for either purpose.\n\nBy the way the relation of Minion semi bold and bold, 39/62, also is not a golden ratio, but also not that far off :)\n\nAlso I am a bit infected with Bringhurst's view that most bolds are too bold.\n\nI don't claim to know the answers here, I'm just asking.\n\n"

Sounds less scary and complicated when it's put in words rather than a formula, doesn't it?\n\nHowever, I see one weakness in treating the stem weight as an absolute value between zero and infinity. I suggest to define \"weight\" not as stem weight but as black versus white, which means a number between zero (no weight, just white) and one (the point when the counters and white space becomes zero and we have 100% black.)  \nThis would reflect that the geometric series gives nice relations only in the lighter weights whereas in the black regions a slight increase in stem weight can have a significant effect on the \"colour\" of the font.\n\n"

In other words, the ratios between successive terms is the same--the defining feature of a geometric progression.\n\nAnd that's de Groot's basic point in words: don't do successive weights by adding a constant--an arithmetic progression--but by having the ratios between successive weights the same--a geometric progression.\n\nNo doubt a geometric progression makes successive weights in a sans \\*specimen\\* look nice. But it doesn't answer the question which Nick asked, which is how big a jump between weights is best, nor the general question what weights are needed or best for use as type on the page.\n\nAlso the issue of bolding horizontals and curves seems to me a more complex issue, more resistant to simple formulas.\n\n"

If the weights are there to function as text, reversed text, subhead distinction, and display distinction, it is another thing.

I struggle getting bolds and heavies to look right. The heavier it gets the harder it becomes. I also understand that there is a problem with this whole process at the thin and, particularly, the fat ends of a typeface family.\n\nNevertheless, the real question was _\"How much thicker a bold weight should be compared to its regular?\"_\n\nWhat I noticed from my 'research' (which I know was not thorough) was that as I added more regular/bold examples to the list, the closer the average got to Φ.\n\nJames, I completely agree with you and the Duke that “If it looks good, it is good”. But what I found was that when I used Φ, it looked better than the proportions that I was using. I need a lot of help and if maths helps me I'm happy to use it. I want to know how to make it look good/better, I have no problem with your assertion, it's getting there that I don't know how to do!\n\nIncidentally, I realise there was a slight flaw in my explanantion: _It turns out that the ratios (regular:bold) varied between 0.52 (not enough difference to be effective) and 0.67 (too much difference), but the average was 0.6216._ Of course, the smaller the ratio (regular:bold), the larger the difference between the weights (so the two comments in parentheses above are the wrong way round).\n\nBill, using your example figures from Minion, if the regular width was 1, then I assume you mean that the semibold is 1.39 and the bold was 1.65. It follows that the ratio I am looking at for regular to bold = 1/1.62 = 0.617 (which is very near Φ). In these terms, the ratio of the semibold to the bold = 1.39/1.62 = 0.858 \\* (nowhere near Φ and far too large to provide a sufficient contrast to be used as a regular/bold complement together in text).\n\n\\*The relation of Minion semibold and bold is not 39/62 but 1.39/1.62\n\n"
