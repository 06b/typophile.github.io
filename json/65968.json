Before the American Civil War, Spencer was the undisputed king of handwriting. He was also an outspoken supporter of American business education. By the late 1800s business education included some focus on penmanship, and there were many colleges that specialized in it. One of the most influential penmanship schools was founded by Charles Paxton Zaner and his partner E. W. Bloser. Later on, in the early 1900s Austin Palmer introduced the Palmer Method of business penmanship, and it soon became the most popular handwriting system in the United States.\n\nBusiness Penmanship is a single feature-rich font that includes over 1200 characters, covering ligatures, alternates, a large set of beginning and ending extensions, as well as a wide range of Latin-based languages, including Turkish and the languages of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic region. To take advantage of all the OpenType features included in the font, please use within programs that support such advanced typography.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  \nABOUT US  \n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  \n [http://www.sudtipos.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232006/http:/www.sudtipos.com/ \"http://www.sudtipos.com\")  \n [http://www.facebook.com/sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232006/http:/www.facebook.com/sudtipos \"http://www.facebook.com/sudtipos\")  \n [http://www.twitter.com/sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232006/http:/www.twitter.com/sudtipos \"http://www.twitter.com/sudtipos\")\n\n",
