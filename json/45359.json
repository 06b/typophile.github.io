The client, an event planner, wants an exotic but not specifically ethnic feel. Mehndi-inspired decoration will appear in the logo as well — again, trying not to be too specifically Indian but using similar flourishes.\n\nQuestion: If you were asked to put the subtitle “custom designed events” below the company name, what secondary typefaces would you try?\n\nThanks for any suggestions!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706110402im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/heading_6622.jpg)\n\n [‹ Building Signage to \"Match\" with Historical Lettering](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706110402/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45293 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [alternatives for Avenir and New Aster ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706110402/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45383 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
