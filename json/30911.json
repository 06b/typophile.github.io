Since the library returned to the control of the governors of St Bride Foundation on 1 April 2004, plans have been developed to radically improve the accommodation and the services offered, and those plans have now received planning consent.  \nRecently there has been some publicity suggesting that the library might have to close (‘£7m funds needed to save library’ - BBC News 6.1.07), but the £7m sought is not simply ‘To save the library’ but is the cost of this major refurbishment of the building, including:  \n. Building of new exhibition and reading rooms within the present lightwell void with a four-fold increase in the number of books on open access to readers.  \n. Refurbishment of the existing reading room as a special collections area and return of the Blades Library to its pristine Victorian state as the heart of the collection.  \n. Creation of a working demonstration area for the artefact collection with glass-screened viewing zone, coupled with refurbishment of the raked Victorian classroom adjacent to the demonstration area.  \n. Installation of a passenger lift serving most levels of the building, augmented by stair lifts, and rationalization of the numerous floor levels to improve access for all.  \n. Provision of a dedicated book lift between stacks and reading room.  \n. Creation of a BS5454:2000 compliant archive storage area.  \n. Provision of a substantial ground-floor cafe / bar area and an additional meeting room.  \n. Improvements to the theatre area to provide a multi-use theatrical and conference facility.  \n. Imposing new entrance from Bride Lane.  \nAfter the improvements, the St Bride Foundation’s total business model is a healthy one and the future bright; without them the library is expensive to run and cannot continue indefinitely.  \nSo, the question ‘Is the St Bride Library in danger of closing?’ is not straightforward. Firstly, it is intended that the Library will close for the period of the building works in any event; the real question is ‘Will it reopen afterwards?’. Exciting plans have been prepared to radically improve an old and quirky building, and those plans have been granted planning permission, with final approval given only last month. The money to carry out the works is now needed: application has been made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for half the sum required and there is a fundraising strategy in place for the remainder.  \nFundraising is beginning to show results, but the pace needs to quicken so that the project can be assured of success. The building works are anticipated to begin in mid-2008. However the project still needs a considerable amount of money to be secured in the next few months, so that it can be assured of success.\n\nThose wishing to assist should contact the library at their [support page](http://web.archive.org/web/20070323040858/http:/www.stbridefoundation.org/supportus/friendsofstbride.html).\n\nThankyou!\n\n",
