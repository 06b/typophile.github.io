I’ve tried to transcribe, but I don’t recognise most of the words and some may be abbreviated. The first letter of the fifth line is confusing. I’m guessing it is sigma, simply because I can’t imagine what else it would be (san = as), but everywhere else the lunate form has been used. It is difficult to be sure whether the first word in the second line ends with a double tau or a really wide pi. I’m guessing the latter, because double tau seems unlikely at the end of a word.\n\nΠΡΟΣΗΝΙΚΕΝ  \nΑΚΕΠ ΤΟΥΣ  \nΗΦΙΛΟΘΕΟΣ  \nΤΗΝ ΤΡΑΠΕ  \nΣΑΝ ΘΩ ΙΥΧΩ  \nΜΝΗΜΟΣΥΝΟΝ\n\nI believe ’ΤΟΥΣ ΗΦΙΛΟΘΕΟΣ’ refers to ’their love of God’, unless Ηφιλοθεοσ it is a proper noun, e.g. the name of a deceased person.

I can’t explain why the <cite>NYT</cite> gives a plural subject, since the nominative nouns (assuming ΑΚΕΠΤΟΥΣ is a name) and the verb (which I can’t make out, but is evidently a 3rd person singular form) are both singular. The verb looks like a relative of προσφέρω, in this context ”to make an offering.”\n\nContra the Telegraph, the mosaic reads (unusually!) “[to] God Jesus Christ,” with the words abbreviated as nomina sacra.\n\n"

[Brandon Mason](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204528/http:/www.novumtestamentum.com/2005/11/mosaic-inscription_09.php) conjectures that the mosaic was broken and misrepaired; he also calls attention to the ΗΝ ligature in the first line.\n\n[Phil Harland](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204528/http:/www.philipharland.com/Blog/2005/11/updates-regarding-christian-mosaic.html) provides wonderful amplification on the matter of _nomina sacra_ in the penultimate line.\n\nAnd <cite>National Geographic</cite> provides [a photo of the mosaic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204528/http:/news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/photogalleries/oldest_church/photo2.html) _in situ_.\n\n(By the way, I find it incongruous that the bb software compels me to use the tag for “emphasis” when I want to use true _italics_ for a foreign language.)\n\n"
