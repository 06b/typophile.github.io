It had a very fresh, contemporary look without being too impersonal. Clean like a sans without being a sans, or being too stiff. Some of the large size stuff and the italic didn't look as good--perhaps they used the wrong one (there is a and b)--but overall I was impressed how well it succeeded in being fresh without looking too self-conscious or slick.\n\n"

If you mean this exact text/layout, if you provide an InDesign file (or even just an EPS with the text as text, not convert-to-outline-ed) I'll set it in Harrier, sure. Just one thing: Harrier has four -close- weights, but no italic (or you could possibly use Patria's italic as its italic - they have the same slope though). The point however is that you can use the Demi to mark emphasis in a body of Regular (or really any other combination you prefer) like the TYPO magazine boys do so well with Nimbus (and did so well with Patria, for my article in #13).\n\n--\n\nMrs Eaves: I wouldn't recommend it unless you go the trouble of respacing it\\*, since its color is very spotty as it stands. I liken it to a beautiful, captivating woman... with a speech impediment. :-/\n\n\\* BTW, is it true that James Montalbano once did that? Maybe just a rumor.\n\nhhp\n\n"

So, if you ask me — any serif with slapped-on-distinctive-little-(uniform)-shapes is contemporary.\n\nJust my 2 cts.\n\n"
