      "content": "Great idea, Josef. I went through Ralff's page few months ago and I found it to be quite light on information, so I ended up emailing a handful of foundries and individual type designers asking about Cufon licensing.\n\nI don't remember the exact list, but Exljbris, Darden Studio, Process Type Foundry, Paragraph, H&FJ, Dalton-Maag, Linotype and Wilton Type Foundry were on it. Note that I was asking only what the licensing conditions for the Cufon use would be, and not with sIFR or other options.\n\nProcess and H&FJ were a no-go. Or rather like \"La-la-la... we can't hear you... strictly forbidden, STRICTLY !\".\n\nParagraph, Wilton were a no-go as well, but said they were \"considering it\".\n\nExljbris and Darden Studio are OK with no additional strings attached.\n\nDalton-Maag are OK, but you need to ask for it explicitly. Their existing license does not allow for Cufon, and there are additional requirements for high-traffic websites.\n\nLinotype _appears_ to be OK, but requires an additional paid license. I had a really odd conversation with their support, which is in fact still ongoing. In first reply they merely said \"we offer web licenses which offer this usage\", \"this\" referring to Cufon. That's it. And asked for a mailing (!) address to send me an invoice. No mention of the fees, restrictions, etc. I replied asking for a balpark estimate of fees, and they replied that they needed to know the exact typeface and asked for mailing address again... you guessed it... for an invoice. I really don't know what is wrong with them.\n\n--\n\nAnother interesting list to build would be the typefaces seen used with sIFR/Cufon/FLIRin the wild, on high-profile and presumably properly licensed websites. I know I've seen Avenir, Gotham (!) and Akkurat.\n\n--\n\nLastly, can I ask why you have FLIR listed as No in several lines in your table? How the heck can it be prohibited if the font use by the FLIR's server component falls squarely under a typical EULA?\n\n"

Paying for the materials used in commercial work is not a new concept. Designers have literally been doing this for thousands of years. Your client is making money off their site. You are making money by creating the site. I should be able to make money when my work gets used in the site. There is no reason a professional web designer/developer charging a hefty hourly fee cannot license a font and pass that cost on to the client so that the designer who created the font can afford to eat. Instead of wasting your time trying to cook up the web font systems that do not require any spending just buy a license and charge it to the client with a markup or a time charge; _just like you would do for every other aspect of your job._\n\n"

All it does is it simplifies the life of a web designer. And not by much mind you, it saves may be... what?... 2 hours of work. If that.\n\nThe designer is not sitting there and thinking how to _pay_ less. He is thinking how to _do_ less. That's what FLIR & Co. are about.\n\nI doubt many designers are cheap enough to be against web-only licensing. The biggest issue at the moment is that @font-face is not quite there yet. Its rendering quality varies too greatly between the browsers and OSes to be satisfactory. That's one. Hosted solutions like TypeKit are not a feasible option in many cases, because they create external dependencies. That's two. All this is going to be sorted out, but it will take time.\n\nMeanwhile \"hacks\" are the practical option. They work, and they work well.

It’s you building a machine that does the same thing, over and over, much faster than you could ever hope to.

In fact, the way I license type as of today, I would make more money selling you that FLIR server license than I would selling you a single domain @font-face license.\n\nBut you aren’t the guy who makes it a problem. The problem is that at some point someone who hosts 1,000 web sites on one big server realizes that he can install my fonts, and FLIR or SiFR, and make it available to all 1,000 web sites at no additional charge. Suddenly I’m missing out on a lot of licensing fees no matter how it works out. And maybe it makes more sense for me to write a provision into my EULA that allows something like FLIR or SiFR when limited to single domains. But if I have to tweak my EULA for everything like this that come along, I end up with a big ugly hydra of a EULA.

I just think that the expectation is that it should be included in a standard licensing fee.\n\n--\n\nJust try and understand where all these \"hack\" technologies came from. Think 6-9-12 months back from today.\n\nDesigner buys the font, it uses it to set a handful of headers on a website. Then he wants to use it more widely, say, for subheaders and blog entry titles or something like that. So he emails the foundry and asks what it would take to use their typeface in an online context. The standard reply is \"NOOOOOOO\", a more contemporary response is \"we are thinking about it\" as in \"check back in a year\".\n\nDesigner still wants to use the font, but he is also respectful of the type designers (remember how he actually _bought_ it and he _asked_ for a web license ?). He understands that foundries are afraid of the Internet and their fonts leaking onto it in their native formats. So he sits down and considers his options.\n\nFirst is to render on the server (best option really, the font file stays private, the file usage is tightly controlled and falls under simultaneous usage restrictions), second is to render on the client, but with the font data obscured, stripped down or made unfit for copying in some other way. Former translates to FLIR, latter - to Cufon.\n\nNote how the driving factor here is the conservatism and rigidness of the foundries and nothing else. There is exactly one type of license available to the designer and he is forced to get creative within its confines. It has very little to do with unwillingness to pay more money to the foundry, and far more with foundry's own lack of interest in collecting these money.\n\n"

It wouldn't take much imagination to go to a site that used FLIR, figure out the font names and take a few guesses at the filename. If your first guess is whatever.com/fonts/fontname.ttf you've got a font. So, until by default, the fonts are protected from direct downloading, I'm recommending not allowing FLIR use. Perhaps users could use set up a protected folder or something but unless it's done by default in FLIR, I'll assume that few people will.\n\nAnother problem with FLIR is that it's easy to copy a line from the page source render the font to another site. Let's say you find a site that's using a font you like. You can have that site render headlines for your own site. It's not a nice thing to do and it's a drain on the host site's CPU and bandwidth but it can be done.\n\nI'm saying no to FLIR unless they can fix both of these concerns.

Right down to the obfuscated specimen pages.  \n(I know this also because Ethan Dunham told me so, essentially. And I've actually gotten emails from others assuming I'm involved with the site!)  \nFontspring is a first generation peek into the future of retail fonts on and for the web. I've got quibbles about presentation, but the raw materials are all there.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n_But the remote rendering aspect of FLIR concerns me._\n\nOn FLIR:\n\n1) I believe it can be set up so the font file is \\*not\\* exposed. In fact, that's my impression of how it's usually done. The font file is protected from calls outside the server. Invisible to the outside. I'm a lot busy right now, but I'll look soon and get a definitive answer. It's all open source. Anybody else have that info?  \n2) FLIR looks too good to be true and so it mostly isn't. Text-as-images are almost always static content. There's no point in having the server thrash around creating text-as-images on the fly. It's too costly and, except in special circumstances, plain dumb. The technology's been around quite awhile now without a massive outbreak of sites designed with FLIR. And there won't be. But it \\*is\\* yet another fallback mechanism and there's too few tools available to summarily dismiss any of them.\n\nBottom line: I would permit FLIR under the condition that the font files are inaccessible. Or, as you put it, \"not directly linkable\". No URL to bring it to you on a silver platter. (Since they're installable TTFs and OTFs and that's the big bugaboo.)\n\n_I'll let the users determine whether or not a particular embedding scheme should live or die. Cufon doesn't put my fonts at any more risk than EOT did so it stays._\n\nAbsolutely. I understand Ralf's point but I don't think EULA's are about telling customers what's a good web design practice and what isn't.\n\nLastly, as John Hudson suggested on another thread, I would seriously consider re-naming fonts being offered for use with @font-face with a suffix of some kind. \"Web\" or \"Screen\" or somesuch to carve them out and away from those fonts designed and marketed for print. Good for consumers, good for type designers, too, I think.  \nSeparate (yet related) products for separate purposes.\n\nrich\n\n"

It is a one-line change even if there is no corresponding _configuration_ setting. If FLIR requires fonts to sit in a website document tree, that's just sloppy implementation on their side, and not a fundamental FLIR requirement.\n\n_There's no point in having the server thrash around creating text-as-images on the fly.

I won't say exactly what I did but with many sites I was easily able to download the default fonts which are included with FLIR. At almost every site I was able to download the README.txt file from the fonts folder. That means I'd be able to download specific fonts if I could guess the correct filename.\n\nWhat I still don't know is: is it possible to read the config-flir.php file to figure out the font file name? I tried my own test and I wasn't able to get at the contents of my own php file. I don't need to know how to do it, but is reading the contents of a php, if you know the path and filename from someone else's site a really involved thing or it is kind of hard core? I really have no idea.\n\nWhat I'm probably going to do is allow the modified @font-face Fontspring versions to be used with FLIR. That way they'll at least have random filenames. But if the php file can be read, then it'd be easy to figure out the path to the font anyway.\n\n"

      "content": "Hello everyone. A friend pointed me to this thread because you are discussing FLIR pretty heavily here, and being the author of FLIR, I wanted to chime in.\n\nFirst, @typodermic  \n_I checked out a bunch of sites in the FLIR forum's showcase section. I won't say exactly what I did but with many sites I was easily able to download the default fonts which are included with FLIR._\n\nThe fonts can be placed anywhere on your server (including outside of the web root). This is a single line change in the config. The only reason you were able to download these fonts is because you already knew they existed (and knew the filenames). These fonts are \\*NOT\\* the fonts the user uploaded themselves with their folder. Just to clear this up, you were not able to get a directory listing of all the fonts that a user has uploaded unless the server was configured to ignore index.html.\n\nTo say this a different way, if I uploaded my-font289.otf to my fonts directory (in my web root), you would have to be able to guess that the file is named my-font289.otf in order to be able to download it.\n\nAccess to this folder can also be limited with .htaccess which I will be including in a future release for those that don't have the skill set to move the folder outside their web root or write their own.\n\n===\n\n@All the foundries and typeface designers out there, in this thread and beyond:\n\nI apologize in advance. Some may consider this off-topic from the OP, but I figured this was as good a place as any to speak directly to you guys. If any mod as a problem, feel free to fork it onto a new thread. (Also, please ignore any ramblings or things that don't make sense, I've been up all night working on some random thing ;] )\n\nWith the development of font-face, I thought that we, as a community of web and typeface designers, were finally on our way to getting this whole mess of web fonts settled. After reading this thread, it is obvious that I was wrong, and that is what prompted me to write this.\n\nSo let's call this my personal plea to you.\n\nI'm not a web browser manufacturer or anyone else all that important. I've only made a script that I found useful, and then gave it to other people to use. I'm really just someone who wants to be able to use your products. I need to use your products. I like your products. And I am willing purchase what you are selling, if only you would sell it to me.\n\nPlease, please get rid of these costly \"font-face\" and \"embedding\" licenses. I am on me hands and knees begging you to stop demanding all sorts of pointless encryption schemes that only serve to make using your artwork more difficult.\n\nThe web is not your enemy. It is an ENORMOUS new market for you to break into. Sure, your font will get downloaded by some college kid somewhere and used on their flyer, or maybe it would even be outright pirated by greedy people for personal gain. There is no way to prevent this from happening even now.\n\nJust like the music, movie, stock photography, and book industries (and many others) have already found out:\n\nThe web is scary at first -- it is different -- it might even require a change to the way things are done. But, as these industries have already demonstrated, it can become very profitable once the fighting stops and the leap is finally made. The same mistake being made in the typeface industry has already been made by so many other industries -- looking at a pirated font file as a lost sale. This is not the case. That person who is stealing your font file probably wouldn't have paid for it in the first place and in trying to keep them from doing so is being done to the detriment of countless potential customers.\n\nI want to keep this short (I've already failed), so just to summarize: Let us (web designers and developers), have easy access to buy and implement fonts -- at the same price as we would otherwise pay to purchase and Photoshop all the headers on our sites. Let us have this ability and we will use it. I promise you, we will in numbers that will make you -- and your industry -- very happy.\n\nPlease stop fighting us. We are not your enemy. We would like to be your customer.\n\nI welcome any kind of comments to my email -- [cory.mawhorter@ephective.com](mailto:cory.mawhorter@ephective.com) -- and would be happy to discuss the subject with any foundries or anyone else.\n\n"
