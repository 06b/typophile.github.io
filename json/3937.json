I am unfamiliar with some of the historical contexts to which you referred, but I felt that the topic was well handled. like I said, one more read and I may be able to offer some more useful comments.   \n   \nI can say that the translation to english was a bit garbled in places. the disturbance to my comprehension was only minor, but nonetheless present.\n\n"
