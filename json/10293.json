If you have, I am really interested in your motivation for donating your design work to the public domain. Did you do it because you are a believer in \"free culture?\" Did you do it because you judged your font to be \"noncommercial?\" Did you do it for self-promotion? Can't suggest any more off the top of my head - help me out!\n\n",

      "content": "I think there are a number of reasons why type designers give fonts away. Here a few that come to mind:   \n   \n**1. Promotional purposes.** The idea is to give away a free sample to generate interest and good will with hopes that people will pay for other fonts offered.   \n   \n**2. Specialized non-commercial niche.** There are some areas such as academia or hobbies for which type designers, usually amateurs, create fonts to fulfill some special purpose. The fonts are given away out of a sense of sharing with others who have the same interest.   \n   \n**3. Lack of confidence.** Novice type designers or others who may just be dabbling in type design give fonts away just because they don't think their fonts are good enough to charge money. Often, these fonts are incomplete or untested. By giving the font away, the designer absolves him or herself of responsibility for how the font performs. (I suspect that most freeware fonts fall into this category.)   \n   \n**4. Idealism.** Some type designers give away their fonts as part of the free software subculture. This is a nice idea, but I suspect these people have some other source of income and lots of free time. (BTW, giving away commercial fonts created by others is not idealism, it's piracy.)   \n   \n**5. Hopelessness.** Some type designers give away their fonts in the belief that it's not possible to make money in type design (not actually true, btw) and see it as a \"labor of love.\"   \n   \n**6. Public service.** Sometimes a fonts designed for some practical purpose are given away to gain wide distribution, such as web fonts or system fonts. It may also be that free alternatives are already available from other sources. Bitstream's free Vera fonts are an example of this. Their commercial font business does well enough that they can afford to do this as a public service. My font [Anonymous](http://web.archive.org/web/20061113083115/http:/www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html) is a similar case. On one hand, it was derived from an existing freeware bitmap font and it only seemed right to keep it free. On the other hand, I saw it as a way to draw visitors to my site and demonstrate the quality of the commercial fonts I offer (see reason 1 above).   \n   \n**7. Lack of authorship.** By this I mean people who trace or autotrace existing fonts from old specimen books, often without much skill, and give fonts their fonts away because they wouldn't feel right about charging for something that took so little effort. (This can be like numbers 3 and 4 above, but for people without original ideas.)   \n   \nI'm sure there are other reasons, and I'm sure that some of these are colored by my own point of view as someone who makes a substantial part of his income from selling fonts.\n\n"

I think the Vera fonts are a case in point. Bitstream hopes that they�ll get some custom work out of the arrangement with Gnome, or that customers will want the better hinted Prima versions. Likewise with our �Web fonts� we gave them away for free to help establish them as the standard for Web typography.   \n   \nThere�s also another element to 3 namely hassle.

TeX does in fact do small caps, but accomplishes them by choosing a different optical scale of the base font. Yes, TeX does optical scaling, and has since before Microsoft Word was in diapers. This is one of the reasons why doing an optically scaled series of this font is so appealing -- people will be able to use the optical scaling without having to twist themselves into pretzels. You are correct that TeX does not have oldstyle figures in its base glyph complement, and that they're unusual in math setting.   \n   \nFrom a technical point of view, I'd need to distribute the free version as a PostScript Type 1 font, because that's what the PDF export from TeX needs as its raw materials. TeX's own font format, Metafont, is pretty much dead these days.   \n   \nI have deep roots in the free software culture, but am not a fanatic. In this particular case, it's mostly a pragmatic decision. Many, many companies have tried to build proprietary extensions on top of TeX (including simply selling fonts for it), with absolutely no success. I would much rather see my work used and the overall typographic quality of math publications raised than follow those footsteps.   \n   \nIn any case, I don't believe that free software is for everybody, but have warm feelings for its own particular strengths and charms. In any case, William, the analogy here is not people who pirate music, but people who release their own music for free. Maybe that does depress the market for commercial work, but at the same time I doubt that Britney Spears' corporate owners lose much sleep over the vast quantities of jam band music available at etree.org.   \n   \nI'd also like to bring up the EULA issue; users of my free fonts will be able to add new glyphs or otherwise customize them, without having to worry about running afoul of the EULA.\n\n"

My point was that some who pirate music - and perhaps also fonts - do it on the excuse that it all 'ought to be' free. And that argument I was rejecting.   \n   \nIt sounds like for the market you want to serve, there is no way to be compensated directly for it. But my point is that being compensated will sustain you to do other worthwhile projects of your choosing. So if you can include the font as part of your math publishing software, and charge for that, all the better, in my view. If that must be free, well so be it; I just worry about you being able to sustain the fine work you are doing.   \n   \nGood luck with all of it!\n\n"

It could be considered 'niche' if the numbers of the target users of those fonts were not in the millions, or tens of millions.   \n   \nThe non-Latin 'extensions' of the popular Western typefaces�Cyrillic, Greek, Armenian, Hebrew, etc.�developed by the enthusiasts (actually, hackers) are most often given away. 99 per cent of the time those 'extensions' are developed without knowledge, let alone consent, of the copyright owners�designers, foundries or distributors.   \n   \nIt is ironic that some of those unbidden 'localisers' even provide references to the original typefaces, and credit their designers�without ever asking their permission for meddling with their designs. And then those bootleg non-Latins are given away. The quality of those freeware fonts is not an issue, of course: one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.   \n   \nOne consequence of the development and distribution of those unauthorised derivates is that along with a set of non-Latin glyphs they include the entire complement of the original 7-bit Latin glyphs. That is quite enough to set texts in English, so this covers 90 per cent of the demand for typesetting in foreign languages that exists among the users of non-Latin fonts. The inability to set texts in German, French, Spanish, etc., does not feel like a great problem to most.   \n   \nEven if the real market for the 'payware' digital fonts existed in, say, Russia, the unauthorised localisation would leave very few chances to the sales of the 'real thing' there.   \n   \nOf course, the OpenType technology takes this problem to a whole new level. In one quick sweep, a font hacker can snatch so much more than he or she used to in the recent past: small caps, ligatures, alternate alphabetical glyphs and figures, etc.   \n   \nI know that many designers of the original typefaces feel pretty frustrated with the practice I am referring to�even if the development of the non-Latin versions of their typefaces is not at the top of their own production schedules.

Let's face it: Napster enjoyed huge popularity with millions of people, world-wide. And those who offer the fonts, or other software for free are�most predictably�popular with the masses.

Idealism and public service did have something to do with it but, for me, it was a way of cutting my teeth, typographically speaking, and a way of determining where the public's taste lie.   \n   \nA lot of my earliest (1997) stuff was, in retrospect, pretty crappy (mostly spacing issues, but some design inconsistencies, too). Practice, practice, practice, and things gradually improved. But progress is not made in a vacuum: I have to acknowledge a tremendous debt to Ilene Strizver, who helped me develop my commercial releases through ITC and Agfa Monotype.   \n   \nI probably would have continued developing freeware fonts while peddling commercial ones as well, if not for a few sad facts...   \n   \na) if you give stuff away, there are sorry bastards out there who will steal it and sell it; and   \n   \nb) if you give stuff away, there are clueless individuals out there who somehow expect you to personally give them more of your time (I want you to design a font for me, or copy someone else's design, or re-design your website to suit me, or...).   \n   \nI'm not sure which is worse, the thieves or the ingrates, but eventually I got fed up with feeding their kind (so much for the idealismj argument).
