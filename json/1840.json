Then you've already talked to several design firms that asked you from $500 to $2000 for 3-5 mockups, and promised to have your logo done in a month or two. But why spend a lot of time and money on a logo you may not finally like at all, just because it is custom?   \n   \nNow you have an opportunity to have a great logo that you really like in just a few minutes, risk-free, and at unbeatable price. Swift Logos offers pre-made logo designs that allow you to create your own custom logos without having to hire an expensive design studio.   \n   \nYou can choose the logo you like most from hundreds of great pre-made logos created by our professional designers, and instantly receive it in editable Adobe Illustrator and Corel Draw files. Write in your company name and slogan, and in no time you will be able to use it for your company letterheads, brochures, website, and other marketing materials. Do it yourself or have us customize it to fit your needs.   \n   \nGet Your Logo Now!   \nNeil Walker   \nSwift Logos.com\n\n",
