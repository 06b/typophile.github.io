  "content": "Hi,\n\nI have a question regarding good kerning practices in stationery design.  \nI’m working on a stationery project and in the business card I have 3 stacked lines (address and phone) and I’m wondering if it’s o.k to kern the 3rd line quite loose in order to match the length of the other two lines. Also, my 2nd line is slightly looser than the 1st line. Is this practice acceptable or a big “no-no” in typography ? Thanks very much !\n\nJen\n\nTypeface: Cronos-small caps 7.5/10\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [drupal](http://web.archive.org/web/20101227080656/http:/typophile.com/files/drupal_69) | 13.03 KB |\n\n",

Your example which creates a 'block' reads fine.\n\n"

      "content": "Oh I see, so as long as the text feels like a block (without the rivers) I’m fine. But what about consistency, I think that’s what Si is talking about; i.e. spacing of phone and the apartment number ? Is this just a personal taste ? For the last few days I’ve been looking at a lot stationery from a various studios and some designer would kern in a similar way, but others would not even touch it (and I’m not taking about excessive kerning here). I know it’s a case by case thing, but clearly it seems to me there are different schools of doing it ?\n\nPS  \nSi, I’m not sure what do you mean about the post code. Is there a correct way of spacing a post code ?\n\n"
