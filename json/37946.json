Adobe requests unspecified money damages, a declaratory judgment, costs and attorneys’ fees. On March 2, 2007, the court entered an order staying the action. The parties have moved jointly to extend the existing stay until November 15, 2007. We intend to vigorously contest the action.\"</cite>\n\nWho has more details concerning this new lawsuit?\n\n",

Further below in above document, Monotype writes:\n\n<cite>An unfavorable outcome in this lawsuit could result in an increase of the amount of royalties we have to pay Adobe. Any royalties paid as a result of this or any successful challenge would increase our expenses and could negatively impact our relationship with such licensor, including by impairing our ability to continue to use and re-license technologies or fonts from that licensor. ... ... We have been in the past involved in litigation with third parties, including Adobe, to defend our intellectual property rights and have not always prevailed.</cite>\n\nThe \"end user\" as ordinary font buyer, who reads such statements made by Monotype alias Linotype, will think: Why should I want to pay for fonts, if even Monotype and Linotype do not want to pay for fonts?\n\n"

Have _you_ checked for historical comparisons because all the fonts I've browsed are the ones I've seen the prices before and their prices are much higher. Because why? Because they can.\n\nIts unacceptable because its not incremental. In other markets it has to move slowly. Other markets, we're generally referring to are manufactured goods, but fonts are made once and sold over and over. So economy or not I think its a rip off. If it was just localized to Monotype I wouldn't care too much, but since they are the Microsoft of the type world they set market price everywhere else. I'm just glad that I really don't care for much of the output coming out of Monotype these days. The indies get my business. There is better value (and quality) there.\n\n"

      "content": "Without knowing which fonts you're talking about, Mikey, I couldn't possibly do any historical pricing comparisons. Having worked for several type foundries and distributors in the past decade, I know for a fact that a number of fonts under the Monotype Imaging umbrella have been priced in the $40 range for years. Before I started working in the type business, I managed font libraries and licensed a lot of type for a variety of companies from many different distributors. I'm familiar with pricing from both sides historically speaking, otherwise I wouldn't comment.\n\nEven some typefaces that are the same design but licensed from different sources can have different pricing. It can get kind of complicated to be a typeface distributor, and I understand that it might be confusing to someone who has no knowledge of the business side of type.\n\nI see a lot of markets moving quickly in price increases. If one doesn't like the prices at one foundry/distributor, there are myriad other choices. Monotype does not dictate the pricing in the worldwide font sales market - many factors go into determining pricing. With so many type designers and foundries operating independently, I don't think you have to worry that all font prices are going to unilaterally double or triple in the near future. Since you prefer indie type, it seems like you are in good shape.\n\n"

It's a little simplistic to say \"making fonts doesn't cost more, so the font prices should never go up\". There's the matter of where the type comes from, is it licensed directly or resold? Is the OT version something that was generated automatically, or painstakingly made by a person? Is the PS version actually the same one generated in 1989, or has it been updated several times, improving overall reliability? Have the royalty arrangements changed between foundries? When you buy Minion from Adobe, there have probably been several versions of what appear to be the same exact file.\n\nI'm not sure why you think price increases like this aren't incremental. If the price actually doubled every year after not changing for a decade, that would be unexpected. From $40 to $42 isn't what I call exhorbitant.\n\n"
