      "content": "I'm generally of the opinion that the identifiers used in development tools needn't be the same as or limited by any of the requirements of the post table (or of Adobe's naming recommendations). If tools are going to offer to write development names to a post table, then they should flag any that are too long or otherwise contravene particular specifications.\n\nThat said, I don't see any reason why this restriction in the post table spec shouldn't be removed. As I understand from Apple, it was originally made because of some ancient software that is no longer relevant.\n\n"
