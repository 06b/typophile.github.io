  "content": "Hi,  \nSaw the posting on American type ( [http://typophile.com/node/12634](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/typophile.com/node/12634 \"http://typophile.com/node/12634\")), which reminded me of a research on swedish typography I was working on a while ago. Since I don't know of any swedish typography forums, but am sure there are lots of swedes hanging out here and others with opinions on the subject, I thought I should give my research a new try here with this posting.\n\nBeeing Swede (hej!), I feel kind of rootless when it comes to typography. We don't have a great history of punch-cutting (something I read was because of our our country beeing so small and the equipment was to expensive...) nor very many new, digital typefaces by Swedes. But still, there must be such a thing as swedish typography?  \nLiving in Amsterdam, I asked my teachers and friends -- not beeing Swedes -- what their opinion on swedish typography is. Most of them didn't have a very strong opinion, and they are people with a great knowledge on the matter, so I take it as swedish typography isn't very \"famous\" or known.  \nThere are of course typefaces by swedes - from Berling by Karl-Erik Forsberg ( [http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P\\_1157.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1157.html \"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P\\_1157.html\")), the most known one, to newer fonts such as Kada (lineto.com), Peter Bruhns typefaces (fountain.nu) and such.\n\nThe thing is, I am not really sure what I am looking for. Is it typefaces designed by swedes, used by swedes or maybe inspired by swedes/sweden? If i design a typeface based on something I found in Germany, is my typeface swedish (as me), german (as the original) or dutch (where I live and study under great influence of dutch typographers)?  \nI guess I am looking for everything; typefaces, contexts etc.\n\nSomehow I would consider Berling a \"true\" swedish font -- it is the only one I know of that actually has been designed for the swedish language; how we combine the letters in the swedish language and so on. But is that then the definition of a typefaces history? Did Frutiger design Univers for the french/german (sorry, I don't know what part of Switzerland he was from) language, or did he design it for all latin languages; does that have anything to do with anything?\n\nI don't know if anyone has an opinion on this but I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nBest  \nPeter Ström\n\n",

      "content": "What a great topic!\n\nI think that Sweden is actually a hot-bed of typography. First, you have [Fountain](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fountain) in Malmö ( [http://www.fountain.nu/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.fountain.nu/ \"http://www.fountain.nu/\")), run by [Peter Bruhn](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Peter%20Bruhn).\n\nThen there is MacRhino ( [http://www.macrhino.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.macrhino.com/ \"http://www.macrhino.com/\")), whose homepage bills itslef as \"a new Swedish foundry\". [Stefan Hattenbach](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Stefan%20Hattenbach) is a regular here on Typophile. I think that [Stephen Coles](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Stephen%20Coles) used to work for him in Sweden. Coles could be considered an honorary Swede, at the very least.\n\nLook at Linotype's Library (in Germany) over the past few years. Since I began working there, I've begun to think more and more that we are turning into a bastion for Swedish type designers… in our library, there is work from:\n\nAnders Bodebeck ( [http://www.linotype.com/7-2286-7/andersbodebeck.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.linotype.com/7-2286-7/andersbodebeck.html \"http://www.linotype.com/7-2286-7/andersbodebeck.html\"))  \nBo Berndal ( [http://www.linotype.com/7-1936-7/boberndal.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.linotype.com/7-1936-7/boberndal.html \"http://www.linotype.com/7-1936-7/boberndal.html\"))  \nFranko Luin (not born a Swede, but been there long enough! [http://www.linotype.com/7-1527-7/frankoluin.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.linotype.com/7-1527-7/frankoluin.html \"http://www.linotype.com/7-1527-7/frankoluin.html\"))  \nLutz Baar ( [http://www.linotype.com/7-1945-7/lutzbaar.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.linotype.com/7-1945-7/lutzbaar.html \"http://www.linotype.com/7-1945-7/lutzbaar.html\"))  \nand Lars Berquist ( [http://www.linotype.com/7-1925-7/larsberquist.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.linotype.com/7-1925-7/larsberquist.html \"http://www.linotype.com/7-1925-7/larsberquist.html\"))  \n(maybe more, sorry if I left anyone out).\n\nPlus, in Stockholm, you've got Pangea Design ( [http://www.pangeadesign.se/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.pangeadesign.se/ \"http://www.pangeadesign.se/\")) which looks like Sweden's coolest design studio (at least from their website). Frederick from up there is an active poster here.\n\nThere are other typographic studios, too, i.e., A4 ( [http://www.a4.se/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.a4.se/ \"http://www.a4.se/\"))\n\nLastly, a month ago, I saw the most fantastically illustrated book on the history of typography… and it was in Swedish (my girlfriend can speak some of the langauge… I think I had her translate half of it aloud for me just so that I could understand some of it!). I don't have a link to it, but it was new…\n\n_The thing is, I am not really sure what I am looking for. Is it typefaces designed by swedes, used by swedes or maybe inspired by swedes/sweden? If i design a typeface based on something I found in Germany, is my typeface swedish (as me), german (as the original) or dutch (where I live and study under great influence of dutch typographers)?_\n\nI think that your typeface would be Swedish AND German… and maybe Dutch, too. That is the great thing about moving around.\n\nJust because some experts you asked in the Netherlands did not know much about Swedish typography doesn't mean that Swedish design isn't good or well-known. I'm an American living in Germany, and I haven't even spent three days in Sweden. But the quality of the work up there has managed to filter down to me anyway.\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"

A typeface is Swedish if the designer is Swedish. Other will argue the opposite, and whenever I go to Denmark I can almost see their point. Now** there's **a typographic tradition You'll notice as specifically Danish. Although I wouldn't go so far to say You'll read Danish more efficiently in their wide sturdy type. Looks nice though.  \nThe Swedish typographic scene has its heroes, but there hasn't been any real continuity, and, as elsewhere, no status in the craft. However, I wouldn't exclude the possibility that in the not too distant future there could actually be something happening in a more organized way. As Dan points out, things they are a-cookin'.**\n\nRegarding Karl-Erik Forsberg and Berling: We recently redesigned and updated it as [Berling Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20140505020436/http:/www.berlingnova.se/) **and we're currently exploring possibilities for additional weights etc.**\n\nƒ\n\n"

Emil Ruder, the champion of the International Style, has a special section on Univers in his _Typographie_ (1967). There he shows its being used to typeset various languages, and compares it with other typefaces he thinks worked better for certain languages, and worse for others. If memory serves, those were: Garamond, for French; Baskerville, for English; and Bodoni, for Italian. That sort of thing...\n\n"

      "content": "Hi there Peter,\n\nI think the Swedish typographic scene is more alive and kicking than ever. I do have a great respect for older designers like Karl-Erik Forsberg, Kumlin, Bo Berndahl etc, but the younger generations are coming on strong. I am probably somewhere in between (43, but hey I feel like 25) and plan to make a hell of a lot more typefaces than the the bunch I've made so far. I have the greatest respect for older techniques and the skill and knowledge that had to be included in order to perform well. But on the other hand I thank my lucky star that I live here and now, and are able to produce so much more than a couple of hundred years back... Fountain, Pangea and some others are also very active and I find it very stimulating to be part of all this. Peter, please welcome to join the party - long live Swedish typography!\n\nCheers\n\n"

      "content": "Hej everyone,  \nThanks for the shown interest and great answers!  \nI guess I was beeing a bit unclear of how I see swedish typography – it's not that I don't think there are great things going on right now, I do for sure; I think what a lot of the people mentioned above do is amazing, and Farsan (oh, thats Peter Bruhn to you) has been my typographic guide in life since as long as I can remember, his stuff is of course awesome.  \nI guess, it's more about if these typefaces are swedish or just made by swedes.. if that is something that can be decided these days, or if that's just totally uninteresting? I guess I have compared the situation with things such as what was going on in Switzerland in the 50s-60s and the heritige coming from that (with things as the fonts at lineto.com, that in my opinion is very swiss somehow). But I am thinking more and more that in the days of modern living, with internet and all, maybe a thing as swedish typography is totally uninteresting; we pick our ways of seeing things, influences and so on from here and there, and don't follow in the traditional footsteps of other swedes (in this case). As said in my first posting, I don't really see my typographic interest coming from anything swedish, it has more been based on books & internet (from everywhere) in the past and dutch typography since I moved to Amsterdam.  \nWell, have to go to school now...\n\nGrüsse,  \npeter\n\n"
