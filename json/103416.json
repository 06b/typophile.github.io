Compare to the specimen in Jaspert's Type Encyclopedia, 1970:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122712im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FuturaLightSM_6602.jpg)\n  \nAs for history, author etc, here is what Jaspert said:  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122712im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FuturaInfo_6488.jpg)\n  \nRenner's early versions had some significant differences in letter-forms, but that may be more info than you want at this stage.  \nDon \n"

It seems the greek variant is specific to Deberny & Peignot as they produce it punchcutting while Bauer use a pantographic process to directly produce Futura.  \nWe wrote a book in french about the history of Futura typeface.
