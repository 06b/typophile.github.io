Gotham Rounded is actually a good alternative. I've also found [Novecento](http://web.archive.org/web/20130430112506/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/synthview/novecento) (very close but not rounded), [Houschka Alternate](http://web.archive.org/web/20130430112506/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/g-type/houschka-alt-pro) (/W and /R off), [Solomon Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20130430112506/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/solomon-sans), [Gabriel Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20130430112506/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/gabriel-sans) (as many [FontFabric](http://web.archive.org/web/20130430112506/http:/fontfabric.com/category/all-fonts) fonts actually).\n\n"
