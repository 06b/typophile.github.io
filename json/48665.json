I already have the logo and I wanted to see if I could get some advice on a nice professional looking Sans-serif type face that will complement Times New Roman which I used in my logo. This is my personal logo.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023075750im_/http:/typophile.com/files/personal%20logo%20Cody%20G_5353.png)\n\nAny comments on the logo would also be appreciated, It is easy enough to recreate with any typeface, I just liked the way that Times New Roman looked.\n\nThank you\n\n",

I think that I will search for a new font for the words. Though I quite like the way the Times New Roman G wraps around the diamond.\n\n"

I tend to consider how a logo can be combined with other elements on things like business cards and letterhead, and I think the top one has more possibilities.

While the effect of the diamond shape going both over and behind the G is cool, it would be lost somewhat when reduced to the size needed for a business card or sent via fax. This is why I always design logos first in just black and white. That way I know it will work on a photocopy or over a fax. With your second set, the lighter blue thin cross hairs could be converted to black for things like fax cover sheets and still work fine.  \n--  \nNancy Foster  \nFontzilla's Alter Ego [http://www.fontzilla.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023075750/http:/www.fontzilla.org/ \"http://www.fontzilla.org\")\n\n"

      "content": "I never noticed the h floating, perhaps ill have to print it out again and take a closer look at the h.\n\nYes, I did notice that before I redid it, at smaller sizes the corners of the diamond seemed to get lost and it just looked like a G. That's a good idea, to design it in black and white first. I probably should have done that with this one. In any case I have a long way to go as a designer and a very long way to go as a typographer. :)\n\n"
