At present I am using Myriad Pro instead of Helvetica as a work-a-round. I’ve already stepped my client through that process twice as I had to explain to him why we couldn’t use Whitney or Helvetica because he occasionally gives the files (as PDFs) to his other seminar leaders as well as those people they train who then turn around and do more internal training. It is a logistical nightmare and makes using Myriad more and more attractive. I don’t hate Myriad. I do like it and have found it serves most purposes in the presentations.
