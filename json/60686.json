And I renamed the folder FDK to FDK\\_25\\_21898, because I am using three versions of the FDK at the moment.\n\n**paragraph**\n\nRemember to deactivate the FLS option \"Use subroutines to compress outlines in CFF table\".\n\n\"Also, should I always run it with the -a switch to replace the FLS5 hints altogether?\"\n\nWell, I prefer to remove all hints in FLS, before I autohint a font, but if you don’t remove them, it should be the -r option, shouldn’t it? I am not sure at the moment, because the autohint help says \"has effect only, if the history file is being used.\"\n\n"
