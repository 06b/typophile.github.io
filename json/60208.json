  "content": "Alright typophile, I work for a company that uses a bastardized version of Gill Sans as their corporate font. Seriously, they paid someone in the 90's to basically alter Gill Sans' quirky Ultrabold \"I\".\n\nThe problem as a part of the design team is that we have to work with a fractured and incomplete set of glyphs. It's a postscript version with no kerning pairs, ligatures or well...anything. It's just bad.\n\nI want to propose the complete set of Verlag as an alternative which is much more fresh and has a lot more flexibility in terms of OpenType. I chose it because it would allow the company's literature to transition a little more seamlessly rather than having to recreate everything at once.\n\nI've expressed these things to the higher-ups and they want (and are open to) a proposal.\n\nSo, what does typophile think of this idea? Can anyone else think of some advantages?\n\n",

Show them too, side by side, text with & without of ligatures.\n\n"
