  "content": "I have recently started collecting books with cover designs from the early modernist period, as they are particularly beautiful and abstract solutions for visualizing seemingly complicated philosophical, psychological, sociological, and business-related concepts.  \nLooking at the credits, I came across an amazing one by the designer Harold Pattek. I looked further into this designer and it seems as if he has shared some exhibitions with designers such as Muller-Brockmann, Aicher, Neuburg, etc. Also, I found two of his works in the AIGA design archives. But, aside from this trace amount of information on this designer, I haven't come across anything else. Does anyone know anything about him?\n\nw j f\n\n",
