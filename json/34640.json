Yes, you could sell directly from your website (see joshuadarden.com, a perfect example) but marketing and visibility count for as much as typeface merit.\n\nMake full use of OpenType's advantages; be sure text faces have oldstyle figures for each font; be sure text families are released with at least two weights and matching italics, never leaving out bold italic; and be sure to keystroke-link all fonts the way the big foundries do.\n\n"
