It is has been altered enough to be a different typeface, but basically, it is my handwriting - altered.\n\nIt is too coincidentally close to Gizmo to be the handwriting of somebody else. And with a similar pen.\n\nI am NOT AT ALL HAPPY about this. I will get to the bottom of it.\n\nNick Cooke\n\nPs I am used to seeing slight alterations, (mainly the lower case r), but this takes it to a different level.\n\n"
