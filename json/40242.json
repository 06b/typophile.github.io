  "content": "This font is very similar with Times New Roman, Times, Times Ten, Timeless, Nimbus, Newton.\n\nBut I believe none of them is match with above-mentioned fonts.\n\nFor a hint, look at small “v” letter in Italic and compare them.\n\nAlso, there is available \"fi\" ligature on the font.\n\nI anyone can ID this font, I am very happy because I really like it.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140801164705im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Font%20Sample_5501.jpg)\n\n",
