  "content": "I've been asked to slightly tweak an existing wordmark for a flooring company in Indianapolis, Indiana, but the files provided are flattened (non-vector) tifs and jpgs. If this wordmark isn't a custom typeface, I'd rather adjust it by buying the typeface and re-typesetting it in Illustrator so that the client has the editable artwork moving forward for all usages.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202608im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kermans_5487.jpg)\n\nLook familiar to anyone? I tried a few type identifiers online, but none came up with results that matched this wordmark. I'm guessing because there were limited characters available for me to comment on with their widgets.\n\nIf it's useful, you can also view their logo in play on their current website: [http://www.kermans.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202608/http:/www.kermans.com/ \"http://www.kermans.com\")\n\nThanks, in advance, for any help.\n\n",

I wonder if the designer tweaked it?\n\nKermans has used this for a number of years, though, and I noticed Antiqva came out just in 2011. Any idea if Antiqva was based on something else? That \"source\" typeface might be the version the original Kermans logo designer used to get that wider K and R. Thanks again.\n\n"
