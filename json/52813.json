I don't use script very much and as such I have little knowledge of them.\n\nWhat would allow me to solve my own issue would be if I knew what made a script contemporary?\n\nIt was bought up that 'simple flourishes' make a script look dated. What other characteristics make a script look 'dated'?\n\nCan anyone offer any other resources on the issue, such as web pages or books?\n\nAnswers to all or any of my questions would be useful.\n\n",

      "content": "I think that this is actually pretty subjective. I know that plenty of people would say Alejandro Paul’s scripts are contemporary because they’re some of the best and most popular new script faces being used in contemporary work. But other people would point out that Alejandro and his collaborators are excellent historians in addition to being excellent type designers, and that his work is partly revivals of script by the masters of the past.\n\nThen there are the very popular grunge scripts by designers like Eduardo Recife, with overlapping ornaments, double lines, etc. distressed, and auto-traced. Sure some of them are just rehashes of older designs, but others are new, unconventional, and absolutely gorgeous. But the argument can be made that grunge design of any sort is the echoes of postmodernism’s death rattle, and that the nostalgic scripts that get more use are still more contemporary.\n\nAnd it might be that technology is what defines a contemporary script, that style is irrelevant, and what really makes them contemporary is having a giant Opentype table full of CALT subs that allow it to make up for the tiny number of people who can still use a pen or brush to write legibly. But if we go there all the people who don’t like the idea of technological determinism will start to bitch…\n\nAnyway, I’m going to stop before I get really pretentious, but I think you see what I mean about it being subjective.\n\n"

But I have seen other scripts such as for this cloths company [All Saints](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020153731/http:/www.allsaintsshop.co.uk/) that I consider to have quite an old skool look but still contemporary - so I know where you are coming from when you say it is subjective.\n\n@Florian Yeah and anything like this: [My Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020153731/http:/www.allsaintsshop.co.uk/)\n\n@Nick Interesting the use of the pseudo-randomization. It does look contemporary. It doesn't do much for me though.\n\n"
