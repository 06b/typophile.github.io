I just want to know if I am ethically out of line. As a designer, I would be mortified to try and sell this logo to a company as an original work. As a corporation, I'd feel foolish using it, but the guy I'm arguing with seems to be without conscious.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307215841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo%20Compare_3784.jpg)\n\n",

But I don't think it has a chance of standing up to an appeal from Paramount. Beyond the trademark problem is the problem of copyright. Even if they win the trademark case, I think their use of this as a logo will be destroyed as a blatant violation of copyright.\n\n"

Since your client has no concern for ethics, appeal to his wallet: Help him realize that by using a stolen logo he is in jeopardy. He'll spend a lot of money producing stuff with this logo, and quite likely if Paramount sees it they're going to make him throw it all away. His silly trademark \"registration\" means nothing. You are not ethically out of line for trying to get him to do an original logo; quite the opposite. Would you be ethically out of line to anonymously send a copy of his ripoff to Paramount legal and let them convince him what to do? Probably. But it sure would be fun.\n\n"

My guess would be that Paramount actually created the mark and it has been given to the Navy as part of the many dealings that go into producing and marketing a movie like that. Either way I'm certain there is a legal deal established for licensing the rights to use that mark by Paramount. Just like there had to be a mountain of legal documents covering the use of all of the Navy jets, ships, personel and property used to film the movie.\n\nSo maybe you are right and we are making unfounded assumptions. Just like I assume that a corporation like Paramount has negotiated usage rights for that registered trademark, maybe the company printninja mentions has licensed the usage of that mark too.\n\n"
