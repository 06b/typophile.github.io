(I guess that sums them up?).   \n   \nAt least I should give the \\_impression\\_ of knowing everything. :-)   \n   \nAny pointers to information? Considering the short notice, I prefer information on the web. But book titles you know of will be greatly appreciated as well.   \n   \nSoren O\n\n",

      "content": "Albert-Jan Pool gave me the following answer. (For your information, my employer is presently writing a book called 'Wayshowing' on the subject of signage, signage typography etc. This was the reason for my questions in the first place).   \n   \nQUOTE   \nthanks for your interest in the DIN subject. 1995 Erik Spiekermann asked me   \nif I would be interested in doing a redesign of DIN Mittelschrift, and have   \nit released by FontShop. We thought it a good idea to create a family of at   \nleast 3 or fou weights. I came up with five, the medium resembles FF DIN   \nMittelschrift in weight. The regular is suited for longer reading text. DIN   \nMittelschrift is far too heavy for text. I started designwork by creating   \nthe light and the black version, and took care that the medium, which was to   \nbe generated by interpolation would be close to the original DIN   \nMittelschrift. Most of this, and a lot more interesting stuff can be found   \nin the broschure »FontFontFocus FF DIN« available through FontShop.   \nYou can also find some details on their website.   \n   \nUnfortunately I do not know who ever designed the original DIN. I made   \nseveral attempts, without any result.   \n   \nDIN was originally designed for signage. Most likely in the early thirties.   \nMost countries tried to establish industry-standards by that time. The   \nGermans were pretty much ahead by that time, probably because the fascists   \nwere already thinking of streamlining everything for mass-production of   \nanything needed for the war that was planned. The idea was that most sign   \nmakers would construct the characters by ruler and compass, and scale the   \nmeasurements from a grid. This was thought to be easy. Unfortunately this   \ntheory ignores that most signmakers are quite good at drawing by hand. This   \nis one of the ideas behind FF DIN. It combines strict rules with   \ncraftmanship and provides letterforms which are a bit more fluent than DIN.   \nFF DIN also has a bit more contrast in stroke weight, the horizontal strokes   \nare thinner than the vertical ones. Therefore it is a bit more readable than   \nDIN Mittelschrift.   \n   \nWhen you write a book about signage it would be interesting to contact   \nGerard Unger. He knows a lot about it because he designed a typeface for the   \nDutch traffic signs.   \nAlso interesting:   \nhttp//:www.urwpp.de   \nURW has digitized a fair number of traffic types. They did the previous   \ndutch version (a derivate of the american one), also the spanish, the   \ndanish, the french, and I believe also the english and the austrian ones.   \nThey also digitized the original version of the american \"highway gothic\",   \nwhich is not Interstate. Interstate is a redesign. Some of them maybe not   \navailable as postscript fonts because the character sets do not have   \naccents, currency symbols an so on. They were sold to Signus customers, a   \nformer signage software package with an Ikarus-based proprietary fint   \nformat. Signus used to be very popular because of its extreme accuracy.   \nUnfortunately the Windows version never really made it. But maybe they would   \nlike to convert the missing ones when you mention them as a source in the   \nbook.   \nUNQUOTE\n\n"

      "content": "The short answer: it was designed for the German   \nroadway. (DIN stands for the German Industrial Standard.)   \n   \nThe medium answer: the different weights were not   \ndesigned at once, as a family (think the original   \nHelvetica vs. the original Univers). They're a loosely   \nrelated bundle of faces. Frankly, this becomes obvious   \nas you try to use them together.   \n   \nThe solution: use the FontFont version. The weights are   \nall reworked (by Albert-Jan Pool) to maintain the spirit   \nof DIN (compare the Mittelschrift to the FF DIN family)   \nwhile creating a unified family.
