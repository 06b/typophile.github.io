  "content": "Hi all,\n\nSomeone sent me this sample this morning, and this seems to ring a bell from a past ID, which I can’t find in the archives. The font looks like Bauhaus with some edited characters, but it also has rounded strokes. I seem to recall that Mike F. or Dav ID’d it as a freebie font, but I can’t pin it down anywhere. Anyone know this one? Thanks,  \n- Mike Yanega\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [lufont.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060602220349/http:/typophile.com/files/lufont.jpg) | 20.65 KB |\n\n",

It’s called [Alba](http://web.archive.org/web/20060602220349/http:/www.dafont.com/alba.font) from Font-a-Licious.\n\nI know it was ID’d here, and that’s when I wrote down the note to add this to the Guide. (Which I still haven’t done).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
