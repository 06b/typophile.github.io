What a splendid scan!\n\nTo correct what I wrote: What I knew as Music Hall Text is actually Kirchengotische Schrift and was digitized by Aridi and Facetype (Aeronaut is an incredible set of layered fonts and is half off until June 27th!). Your type, Erica, is Favotir/Teuton text and was digitized by David Nalle as Rheingold.\n\n"
