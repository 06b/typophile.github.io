And they have a commercial version called [Nars](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000837/http:/www.misprintedtype.com/type/type_nars.html), which I think is really nice and grungy.   \n   \nOther grungy looking scripts which I like include Article, Solace from [Lunchbox Studios](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000837/http:/www.lunchboxstudios.com/).\n\n"
