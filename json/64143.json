      "content": "It's the \"Design size\". Originally, it was meant to indicate the lead slug height -- in modern parlance, it includes its 'internal leading'. Any extra leading would be added manually (and I think original lead type was designed to be used without).\n\nNowadays, it doesn't really denote anything special measurement of the font. _Especially_ it does not denote the x-height! Script fonts, for example, may have huge capitals (even 'extending outside the glyph box' -- an effect unable to mimick with lead!), in combination with very tiny lowercase characters.\n\nThe \"12 pt\" you enter is used to scale the font bounding box, and it's entirely up to the font designer where and how he put the characters inside this.\n\n"
