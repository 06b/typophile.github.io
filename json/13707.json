Sadly, very little is known about him. His real name was probably **Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden** , but he most likely went by a series of nicknames, such as \"Henchen\" or \"Elle\". \"Gutenberg\" was the name of one of his family's houses within the city of [Mainz](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mainz), [Germany](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Germany).\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family, Gutenberg was not an aristocrat himself (his father married a commoner). It is not known when Gutenberg was born. Around [1900](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1900), the city of Mainz decreed his birthdate to have fallen in June [1400](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1400), allowing them to throw a big summer party in his honor. Gutenberg died in [1468](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1468) in Eltville, up the Rhein from Mainz.\n\nAs a young man, Gutenberg left Mainz for Strasbourg, in present-day [France](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/France). Sometime before [1450](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1450), he moved back home. Gutenberg worked as a goldsmith and became skilled in the casting of finite amounts of metal. Either in Strasbourg or Mainz, between ca. [1440](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1440) and [1450](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1450), Gutenberg invented the idea of printing with movable [type](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/type) in the west. He invented a way to cast individual letters cheaply, and also a means to [print](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/printing) them (an probably the [ink](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ink) used, too!).\n\nHis first printed work was a Latin grammar. Later, he borrowed money to begin work on the first of a series of Bibles, the B42 (or 42-line Bible). He also printed indulgences, and a sort of proto-encyclopedia.\n\nThese major works were printed in Mainz, even if printing was not \"invented\" there. Gutenberg also had a studio in [Frankfurt](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frankfurt) during his busiest years, were he farmed out some of the production work.\n\nAround the year [2000](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/2000), Gutenberg was voted \"Man of the Millenium\" by an international panel of scientists.\n\nThere is a comprehensive [Gutenberg Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20130827074436/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gutenberg%20Museum) in Mainz, which has three original Gutenberg Bibles in its collection.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Gutenberg!
