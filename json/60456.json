      "content": "Tula, Welcome as a new member.\n\nWhen you want us to match something you can make it much easier if you show us what you are trying to match. Please capture images to show, or include the actual links. The more work you expect us to do just to find your font samples, the less help you may actually get, because we get a lot of requests that don't require extra work first.\n\nThe next point I want to make is that you often will not find fonts, especially free ones (in case that's what you wanted for the charity site) when you are trying to duplicate someone's branded look. The Guardian has had type designed for them, and if it's available, it sure will not be free. Not sure about what Flickr and Snapfish use, but often commercial sites use custom fonts to maintain a unique look. They are not happy when other sites try to imitate their style, as a general rule.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I totally understand that they dont want anyone copying them...\n\nAnyway the situation is, I am not a designer- I'm just a marketing exec, and I have been thrown into the very deep end. so I thought why waste time researching what kind of fonts to use,lets just use tried and tested. Bad idea definitely.\n\nOk here's a link to the home page of this website (I know, I know, its coming along)  \n [http://myexphone.com/myexphone/Default.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150307193326/http:/myexphone.com/myexphone/Default.aspx \"http://myexphone.com/myexphone/Default.aspx\")\n\nand the logo is just a bunch of recycling arrows.\n\nPlease suggest what font will work well on this page.\n\nI thought of these:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cooper-old-style/urw-t-bold/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150307193326/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cooper-old-style/urw-t-bold/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cooper-old-style/urw-t-bold/\")\n\nand\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/caxton/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150307193326/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/caxton/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/caxton/\")\n\nwhich I think comes close.\n\nplease help!!!\n\npic related:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150307193326im_/http:/typophile.com/files/guardian_logo_6065.gif)\n\n"

No, I didn't mean it that way, but if you are trying to change the look, I just thought it would be a better approach to talk to someone who does design, rather than marketing.

It really is that simple. As with Mike and Barkeep, I'm only trying to give helpful, professional design advice. Either you got it, or you don't. You can't learn this stuff in a few weeks.\n\nAlso, there are some nice, close matches to the Guardian Egyptian font.
