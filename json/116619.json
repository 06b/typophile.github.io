More eastern than western in its design, this clash of cultures is tightly spaced for creating striking headlines. Named after the Norwegian word for “pattern”, Mønster’s odd letter forms and exaggerated shapes combine into powerful, vigorous patterns, making a bold statement of any title.

I would probably use it as a display type if my talk involved Western typography. Using it because it \"evokes the non-Latin world\" (which, to me it doesn't to the extent I think you're implying) seems silly. Isn't your choice in selecting this typeface a matter of personal indulgement rather than practical, appropriate use?\n\n"
