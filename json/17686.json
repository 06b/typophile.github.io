Please feel free to mention any website or Books that have any information on OpenType for it might be very useful for my work.\n\nThank You very much\n\n",

I think most type designers would say that the notable omission from Opentype is support for multiple masters and non-linear scaling of features. But this has been discussed before (search), and the omission may be justifiable on the grounds that such features should be in type editors rather than in fonts.\n\n"

To start with, i might suggest the [wiki](http://web.archive.org/wiki/typowiki) article on [opentype](http://web.archive.org/wiki/opentype), which will shoot you off to several different sources of information.\n\n"
