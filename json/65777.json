Similar to [Ortem](http://web.archive.org/web/20100101220856/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/ortem/) and [Seagull](http://web.archive.org/web/20100101220856/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/seagull/). This style is usually considered Art Nouveau, and if you use that as the search term you will find a number of similar styles. I searched at MyFonts, Dafont and Abstract Fonts before realizing that this is not a font. You can see that the letters, while very similar, are not identical when they should be the same.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "I would say it is not hand-painted but stencilled. There is a slight difference between É and E, probably due to stretching of the cutout material. The Ls in VILLA look identical. This is a familiar sort of white-on-blue metal plaque that was made by an enameling process; many cities have civic street numbers that were done the same way in the first half of the 20th c.\n\n"
