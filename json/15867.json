We kept a huge library of these catalogues that we would “troll” for the appropriate font. The web has pretty much replaced this huge library, but nothing beats having the font resources right at hand.  \nObviously we cannot purchase every available font on the planet so I would suggest to type designers and foundries that they send more mailers, promotions and reminders that they have the right “building block” at the “right time” for the design I am putting together._ — Ron Kalina, Kalina Design, Exton, PA\n\nThe survey is followed by several pages Type Designers’ questions & answers.\n\n [‹ Type Thievery](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201111536/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15838 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Sans Serif ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201111536/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15876 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Hmph. One of the things that influences my buying of a font is the extent of a family.  \nI want small caps; I want _italic_ small caps! If there’s a bold, a want bold small caps and bold italic small caps! All with matching OS figs (in the small caps font, please: why the Roman would contain the os figs and the small caps would contain lining figs is completely beyond me, but coming from a country with letters and numbers combined for postal codes it is a major major pain for typesetting.)\n\nAm I the last designer on earth who uses such things for the sake of consistency? I don’t want these things as extra styles, I _need_ them so that if I’ve decided on the use of small caps in my document I can use them throughout and not be faced with that hideous conundrum of encountering eg. “USA” in an italic section or bold heading and having to decide ... now do i fake it (bad), break editorial style and set in caps (bad) or change the style throughout just to accomodate this incomplete font set (highly undesirable)?\n\nFurthermore, if a serif face has a matching sans, I need it all to match: os figs, scaps etc.\n\nAs much as i love and use Eureka & Eureka Sans, the Sans italic has no os figs! What kind of BS is that? I have literally had to change to lining figs throughout a document because of this.\n\nPerhaps I’m too uptight. But the main reason that designers give for buying type being “appropriateness for their message” and, essentially, recognizable, quirky style just makes me roll my eyes, throw my hands up in the air and give up on typography forever.\n\nsorry. got a little ranty.\n\n-marian\n\n"

As I said in my own opinion... several comments just sound like “the smart thing to say.”\n\nIf you know what you are doing, then just do it. Many graphic designers “talk the talk,” but as we all know few “walk the walk.”\n\nWhat I take from the survey is that there is still great potential to market typefaces, and almost an obligation to show designers how to use type, both traditionaly as well as innovatively. It’s like they are all waiting for another Herb Lubalin or U&lc to be awed by type again.\n\n————————————————————-  \nY, I’mO, BI’mBIS!\n\n"

Gotta sell quite a few $40 units to warrant production, printing, and mailing a mag of U&lc’s quality.\n\n"

The “quality” of U&lc was in its layouts and content, plus a bullpen of some of the best designers of that time.\n\nAlso, Aaron Burns initially focused on creating a mailing base of only type specifiers (built from mailing lists from PLINC, other type houses and subscription list from Graphic Design USA) and colleges with art programs. The ratio of type buyers to readership was extremely high. Eventually U&lc sold ad space as well.\n\nDeveloping a direct mail piece in _magazine-like_ format by a foundry or font distributor would be quite costly today. A better approach would be to consider it a true publication, maybe quarterly. The production and printing cost, like any other magazine, would be paid in part by the advertisers, subscribers (if you are charging a fee) and direct purchase (instead of “newsstand” sales, it would be single issues ordered via internet, like [étapes:international](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201111536/http:/www.artdesign.fr/boutique_us/liste_produits.cfm?type=23&num=0&code_lg=lg_us)).\n\nAll in all, it would still be major undertaking.  \nHmmmm... guess we need to come up with another schema. ;-)\n\n"

[Linotype Matrix](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201111536/http:/www.linotype.com/matrix) seems to have the makings of a good trypographic periodical.\n\nThere are inherent pitfalls in creating a _U&lc_ clone by a single foundry, large or small. For one thing, there is a certain bias to content and a danger of seeming too much “advertorial” than editorial.\n\nIn 1990, Agfa launched a large format type magazine called _26_ which lasted a short while since by corporate standards _sales_ did not offset or justify the cost of publication. The attempt was valiant but no one seems to recall the existence of _26_.\n\nIf a company measures “success” of a publication strictly against the sale of fonts and within the advertising budget, then it is doomed to fail.\n\n"
