  "content": "I realise this isn't an easy question and doesn't really have a correct answer as such but I am designing some pages for the following decades 2000, 90's, 80's, 70's, 60's and 50's and would like to use a typeface that is commonly associated with each decade.\n\nA font/s that is recognised within advertising or design trends or some pointers as to what would work for each decade would be very much appreciated. As mentioned I realise that it is impossible to say this is the 50's but if a common theme exisits that would make that visual link for each that would be great.\n\nTIA\n\n",
