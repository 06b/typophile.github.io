Also, are there any other typefaces that are similar? Perticularly, I like how the \"d\" doesn't have a foot and is just rounded.\n\n",

This looks a whole lot like a logo that I developped   \nfor the Programmatorische Overheidsdienst Maatschappelijke   \nIntegratie (POD), a government service for social inclusion.   \nIt didn't get used tho because the name changed. I'll try to post   \nit soon.   \n   \nBTW I think this is customized Helvetica or Univers (I used   \nthe same trick for my logo). I can't check it right now.\n\n"
