Mentioning my book in the same sentence as Bringhurst's is humbling.\n\nBut yes, it's intended as a companion more of less. It's structured for quick reference about the facts but doesn't cover style like Bringhurst.\n\nTheo  \n [http://rosendorf.us](http://web.archive.org/web/20130215075815/http:/rosendorf.us/ \"http://rosendorf.us\")\n\n"
