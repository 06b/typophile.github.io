  "content": "Dear forum members,\n\nI was just wondering what others think about this:\n\nWhen working on your typefaces, are you listening to music (or not)?  \nDoes it influence the work?  \nIs it distracting or beneficial?  \nWhat kind of music do you listen to?  \nIs it different from your usual listening habits?  \nIn what phase of design do you listen to music (or not): conception/drawing, elaboration, programming/production, marketing?  \nAre there any other aspects I forgot to ask?\n\nFor me, i listen to music in elaboration process and marketing, and I usually choose more or less meditative stuff like Sigur Rós, Kraftwerk, Múm, Kante (german band), Django Rheinhard or sometimes even Einstürzende Neubauten (later phase), The White Stripes and Tool. Criteria is that it works “in background”, and I don’t have to concentrate on structur or text of the music necessarely, but can concentrate on the letters.  \nThis kind of music is part of my usual listening habit, but there are much more other bands and genres I listen to when not working on fonts.  \nMaybe I should try what happens if I listen to something in the conceptional phase of a design; until now I don’t think there has been influence on the design because of listening to music besides.\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts  \nSebilar\n\n [‹ I have a problem with the new Typophile Forum FAQs](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212055938/http:/typophile.com/node/17476 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Drawing with beziers ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212055938/http:/typophile.com/node/17316 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Great question Sebilar! I am always anxious to know what people are listening to, in general. Personally, I love to listen to music while I work and design (and admittedly, I have never designed a full out typeface although I have lots of designs in progress). When I have to do grunt/production work, I tend to listen to Rock music - something with a heavy beat. It seems to help me concentrate on the tasks at hand and puts me into a regimented, structured frame of mind. When I am creating and sketching and ideating, I tend to listen to lighter music: anything from classical to jazz to pop music.\n\nSpeaking of music, this question reminds me of something I read in Heller’s book: The Education of a Typographer. It had to do with music and keeping an open mind and I think it was written by Terry Irwin. “Josef Müeller-Brockmann said he believed that, as we get older, our scope of acceptability narrows — it is simply human nature. But, he maintained, as designers, we must resist this at all costs, lest it handicap us as professional communicators. He described how each day, he would take some time to put on his Walkman and listen to rap music because he absolutely hated it. He wanted to keep looking at what was new and fresh out in the world and remain willing to step out of his comfort zone.”\n\n"

Sometimes I feel like some Wu-tang or MF Doom, other times it is Erik Satie or Mozart. I do find that I have to choose the right music for my mood or my attention span and concentration suffers.\n\n"

I don’t think there is a connection between the music I choose and the work I am doing: usually it is just whatever music I feel like listening to or, quite often, a recent CD purchase that I’m ’learning’.
