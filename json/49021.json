I don't even know which script got used in the middle... or which modified sans serif is going over the top, or even the decorative antique serif at the bottom in brackets, let alone the highlighted wedge serif in the middle...\n\nAny ideas would be helpful.\n\nThanks in advance, B\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018070548im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bottle-ref_5177.jpg)\n\n",
