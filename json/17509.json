  "content": "Hello everyone- A peecee user invading here with a Mac software question...\n\nI am trying to modify a font (substitute two characters) and I am curious as to how to go about doing this in the most efficient manner possible... The font in question is a font that was created in /for Mac. I’m trying to alter this font for a professor whose collegues and herself only use Macs in order to be on the same page document wise as this is a differently charactered alphabet.\n\nReading up on the Mac OS it looks like the Fontbook feature “automate” enables the /scanning in/ of fonts... is this true, does it work the way it sounds? (Scan in and assign each character to the map?)\n\nAny help you can offer is greatly appreciated, don’t assume that I know anything overly complicated as I’m a complete noob as far as font manipulation goes. The kicker is as well that I can’t even open the font on the PC to attempt a unicode version or some other version that’ll work with their Macs...\n\nTherese\n\n [‹ fontlab - curves to straight lines (and back)](http://web.archive.org/web/20070810005808/http:/typophile.com/node/17524 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [TTF Hinting - 'little' issue ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070810005808/http:/typophile.com/node/17482 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Thus, if you copy a Mac font suitcase to a PC and back, part of the file may be lost in the transition, leaving you with a damaged (corrupt) font.\n\nIn the Mac OS before OS X, the font suitcases of active fonts were open for read/write all the time the system was running. If there was a crash, open documents could be corrupted. This was the most common cause of corrupt fonts. There may be other ways that fonts (or any other files) may become corrupted, but I have not seen this problem come up very often on OS X.\n\n"
