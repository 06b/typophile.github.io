The media is mostly web, although I suspect biz cards will follow. Message should portray a reputable and trustworthy source for honest comparisons of language schools and their courses. The typeface will be for display. There might be illustrations with it, most likely a friendly looking “agent” or “counselor” type person.\n\nHere’s what I have in mind so far.\n\nLooking for something friendly like Comalle...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210105402im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MLG-Comalle_5607.png)\n\nPlayful like Bello pro...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210105402im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MLG-Bello-pro_4893.png)\n\nReadable (and a little more serious) like Museo...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210105402im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MLG-Museo_4254.png)\n\nAsking for suggestions on which typeface might do the job well.

However, I’m looking for something a bit more informal than Archer.\n\nArcher italic does have the well-rounded friendliness I desire, but it’s not quite playful enough. A worthy adversary on Museo’s playing field. Although not close enough to the hand-drawn feel of Comalle. Definitely going to keep Archer in mind.\n\nSo glad you reminded me of H&FJ.

Yea, I see the lack of contrast in the caps to lowercase.\n\n@Stefan: Yes, I plan on it! Thanks for the reminder and encouragement as well. (I promise I won’t hack up anyones hard work. If I must, I will contact the type designer directly and ask for their help.)\n\n@poms: I’m considering Sauna, although it looks a little too “fat kid eating marshmallow’s” for this identity. ;)\n\n**Omnes** is a great suggestion, I’m digging that a lot! Will seriously consider.\n\n@Sharon: Thanks for the sample! I’m not quite sure a slab serif feels right. Appreciate the suggestion, of course. =)\n\nI’ll keep you updated on which I decide.
