I think that there is too much associated with that combination, especially amoung designers (who would be your target audience as a seller of type, no?).   \n   \nThe colors, with the beautiful intricate forms of your drawings/letters, just cry out \"goth\" to me. Not that there is anything wrong with that, mind you. It just seems that you will be more likely to speaking to a different audience.   \n   \nIts always hard for me to settle on the right color combinations, so I really can't offer any great advice. A professor of mine once told me that all the color combinations that we need can be found in nature. Another told me once to work with three colors, two of which should be close to each other in hue and value, and then the third could be a compliment or a split-compliment.\n\n"

The red/black/white combination is one of my favorites too, but I could see a 'goth' interpretation of what you currently have (even though I didn't take it that way).

I'll answer   \na few questions first:   \n   \nThe images are indeed stock, from the Pepin Press book   \ncalled \"Signs & Symbols.\" I didn't reply for so long because   \nI was awaitng confirmation on whether I could legally use   \nthe images. As it turns out, I can. However, it was always   \nmy intention to modify them.   \n   \nI agree about the paw holding   \nthe torch, it looked off from the beginning. I love all the   \nsuggestions about ebossing, foil stamping etc. When I get   \nthe squids together I shall investigate this seriously. At the   \nmoment, I will have to gang up on another print job, which   \nis one colour, a black purple. See the attached image for   \ncolour and new filigree. The rest of the type is Jenson Pro,   \nwhich I found tucked away inside Indy CS. Is it too much?   \n   \nAs for the dragonbirdthing, I have been playing with the   \nidea of paying a subtle homage to our native bird, the   \nKiwi. It is a flightless endangered beauty and the de   \nfacto icon for New Zealand, pretty much why we get   \ncalled kiwi's. So here it is on my logotype. Does it work   \nany better? I am in the middle of vectorising the thing.   \nQuite tricky. The split-stroke type is my own. Hopefully   \nreleased one day as well.

As for the colours i would recommend to make the combination it suits you best and don't get confused with afterthoughts like \"will it communicate with everybody?\", since your work and taste already is not concerning \"everybody\".   \n   \nPersonaly i prefer the black-red-white variation mainly for the reason that the \"KLIM\" is not messing with the pattern (as i think it happens in the last two variations).   \n   \nAlso i think you sould \"liberate\" the \"Type & Graphic Design\" and \"Mobile...\" lines from the block. The compination with the leaves doesn't work as it does with the \"KLIM\". Further i believe you should avoid the \"stop\" of the block that puts a \"wall\" in front of the leaves. I would advise you to put the lines in an order that follows the rythm of the leaves as the typography is not foreign to the nature but it is inspired from it.   \n   \nthanx for the nice design and hope that the dotted line around the card it is not the croping line and it will be print.   \n   \nchristos\n\n"
