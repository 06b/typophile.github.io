  "content": "Typographic logo for Rubicon Design + Fabrication designed July 2001. This was   \ncut-up letterforms /work in progress I was experimenting with when the client dropped by the studio, looked at it and wanted it as is.. Their slogan is \"more custom than your mom\". All collateral (postcard, letterhead, fax cover sheet, businesscards, website) all use various version of the logo.   \n   \n ![Rubicon logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417195749im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/894.jpg)\n\n",
