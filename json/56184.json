They’re user-hostile (in fact a usability disaster), the mark of an assholish and incompetent Web developer, and, for good measure, a WCAG violation.\n\nNext you’ll be asking us for help typesetting a novel in Arial.\n\n—  \nJoe Clark  \n [http://joeclark.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023162318/http:/joeclark.org/ \"http://joeclark.org/\")\n\n"

It was a self-published novel, and a decent story, but I'm really hoping if he ever finishes his next novel that he asks for help with the typesetting and doesn't do it in Arial again.\n\nI think there's a time and place for pop-up windows, myself, but Joe is most astute than I am, in general, so I'll defer to his opinion.\n\n"

There are various scripts out there to accomplish this. If you're using jQuery, there's the 'thickbox' clone.\n\n"

      "content": "The big problem is really the definition of what a \"new window\" is. Using the standard desktop browser scenario, it's easy to understand that it opens a separate instance of a browser window. But when you're using a handheld device, or a screen-reading device, or a text browser, what consists of a new window? Your design needs to account for that.\n\nOld-skool pop up windows _can_ serve certain specific purposes, but it should be as Joe said not \"unrequested\". As long as the user has a choice, or isn't forced into opening a new window, they can be used.\n\nGiven what you are asking for, which isn't very specific, the more specific term that aluminum is speaking of is technically known as a \"modal window\" and can, and should be, quite accessible. Lightbox, Thickbox, Greybox, they're all just different implementations of a modal window that doesn't open a new instance of a browser window. All simply display a part of your page that already exists, or is requested through AJAX, and hopefully all information is otherwise accessible to those not using javascript.\n\nHope you find what you're looking for!\n\n"
