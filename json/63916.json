  "content": "I just used FontNuke for the first time to see I could remedy a problem with a PS font in Adobe CS4 applications. I just did a general overall cache clean. It didn't solve the problem, but seemed to have caused a corruption with FontLab.\n\nWhen I open the OT window for features all the text in the feature code area is invisible. It seems as though it is still there, but unselectable. So if I type in a new feature like liga, it's invisible in the main panel, but shows liga on the left. This is version 5.0.2 â€¦BTW. Is there some easy solution to this or do I need to get the software guys here at work to reinstall?\n\n",
