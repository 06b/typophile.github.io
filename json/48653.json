  "content": "This is something I've played with off and on all year in my sketchbook. I didn't think this would actually work as a font because it was drawn in an outline and overlapping the letters was impossible in font format, but then I discovered that if I removed the outline the letters could be pushed together and a background layered behind it. It's fun playing with colors. It may all be too much? The counters too thin?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417200549im_/http:/typophile.com/files/grafiti_slab_3496.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417200549im_/http:/typophile.com/files/grafiti_slab_two_5920.jpg)\n\n-Jess  \nbvfonts.com\n\n",

      "content": "Very nice addition to the soft fonts list. It has needed a slab and now it has that. So you say it will have different layers? I really like the idea of that as well. Seems to have a nice combination of urban graffiti style and an old sign painter at the same time.\n\n"

      "content": "The tiny counters place a limit on how small this font will render successfully. Look at Ray's Tank. When he made that one he decided to make a sister version with slightly larger counters for small sizes.\n\nIt works with the outline treatments but in plain guise it suffers from a clagged appearance. Rather than making two versions with different counter sizes, I would make just one version that scales better down to small sizes.\n\nThe lower **w** is letting the side down, sorely in need of integration. Square up the vertices like the **v**. I love the oddball **g** and think you should exaggerate it even more. Make a quartet of alternate oddball **g**'s just like that one only four variations.\n\n**Q** tail fits in just fine. **t** is interesting but have another go at it. I sort of want to like it, but I can't ;^)\n\nKeep it on the stove. Adorn it with squirrels. Kidding.\n\nMake an inline version! Yeah, make an inline. Think of the Starlet potential. Textured fonts sell; if enuff of us make inline fonts they will be the next big thing on the _Mefonts_ Starlets chart. I think they should remoniker the reborn _Myfonts_ site _Mefonts_.\n\nIn several ways it's like some of the A & S Sign font artbrush jobs, the hand-painted romans. Look at Bone Casual, Pen & Ink Roman, Porkchop bold.\n\nAnd it's a bit House.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Possibly even highlights.\n\nJT, Thanks, I agree something needs to be done to the Q\n\nMichael, Thanks!\n\nJames, I think you've convinced me to increase the counter space. The w has been changed, I agree. The t is fussy, everything else I tried seemed out of place, I'll give it another go. A bit House? If you mean finely crafted then I agree, hehe.\n\n"
