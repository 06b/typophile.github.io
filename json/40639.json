Here's the procedure as given [there](http://web.archive.org/web/20110109021709/http:/forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=16834&start=0):\n\n1 - Go to wikipedia. Hit \"random\".  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random](http://web.archive.org/web/20110109021709/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)  \nThe first random wikipedia article you get is the name of your band.\n\n2 - Go to Random quotations:  \n [http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3](http://web.archive.org/web/20110109021709/http:/www.quotationspage.com/random.php3)  \nThe last four or five words of the very last quote of the page is the title of your first album.\n\n3 - Go to flickr and click on \"explore the last seven days\"  \n [http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110109021709/http:/www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/)  \nThird picture, no matter what it is ((SFW of course)), will be your album cover.\n\n4 - Use photoshop or similar to mix it all up. Host it and bring it here.\n\nI bet you all can come up with some spectacular ones. Here are a few that I've already done:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110109021709im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled_4571.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110109021709im_/http:/typophile.com/files/New%20Freedom_6079.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110109021709im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WRONG_3637.png)\n\n",
