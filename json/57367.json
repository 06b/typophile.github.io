Ubiquitous full caps make the text very difficult to read.\n\nI have to use lots of acronyms in blocks of text and actually full caps look too clunky and I find small caps a bit pretentious. So I tend to use full caps but reduced a point size and bumped up from regular to medium to get the weight right. I think Bringhurst had the same idea.\n\nIt depends on how much you need abbreviations and how they look on the page I think.\n\n"

It’s not all that obvious that they are supposed to be caps. They look more like lowercase, especially with a word like “USA” that has such similar shapes in both lc and uc.\n\n"

      "content": "Using small caps isn’t a rule, it is a generalization. Their use should depend on context, even in text. The decision about when to use them is all to often not left to the comp, but to some unseen, unknown editor, who is not happy with anything not covered by a hard and fast rule.\n\nFor example, I did a book recently where small caps were specified for acronyms/abbreviations, but ultimately, use was my choice. One of them was GI, as in the GI’s retuning from World War II. The most common occurrence of GI was “the GI Bill”. Well, “Bill” always has an initial cap, so setting “GI” in small caps in this context would look passing odd. I wound up setting all occurrences of “GI” as full caps, primarily because of the “GI Bill” and because “GI” is only two letters long. Personally, at 3+ letters, I’d have no problem using small caps in some constructions, and full caps in others. Just like using old-style figures with U&lc text, but lining with full caps.\n\nUnless an editor throws a fit, I always set abbreviations/acronyms in subheads in full caps, esp. when the subhead style is to cap the first letter of each word (general style is usually an editor’s choice).\n\nIn your example of “BAAM,” I’d set it full caps. As you say, it is suppose to be emphasized.\n\nAs for small caps that are a bit small, if you’re using InDesign, you can search for all of them & bump the point size a point or so. You can also letterspace them with such a global search.\n\nBumping up small caps is better than setting full caps smaller IMHO. When you set a letter smaller, it also has less weight. Unless you’re using a font where the caps are a bit heavy to start with, I find lighter “smallish caps” unattractive.\n\nFWIW\n\n"
