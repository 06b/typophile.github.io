I think you should   \ntake that lc \"g\" and make an entirely new   \nfont derived from it.   \n   \nIt's just so lovely - it has the same charm   \nthat Newlyn's incomparable Democratica has.   \nIt just needs a little work on the ear.   \n   \nBTW, your \"j\" (and a few of the other glyphs,   \nto a lesser extent) also has that same great   \natmosphere - go with that - and I think you   \nmight even be able to sell the results too.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I do plan on making a Sans-Serif, or Grotesque version some day. Its almost a grotesque face already.. ?   \n   \nHrant, I know just what you mean. sometimes I wish I could just slap this face into something else. One idea; I thought maybe I could make a stencil version, or something like that in concept. I want to break it apart some and follow the curves of the g.\n\n"

      "content": "Good question. I think it had less to do with logic and more to do with character and balance. Or maybe both.   \n   \nI started with the lowercase 'd', then the 'g'. To me, the beginning and ending character is the most important part of a trademark, so I worked hard on those. The 'd' had an upper straight serif too, as well did the rest of the appropriate characters once I completed the first draft. Then I drafted the uppercase with even serifs too. To make a long story short, the whole thing was F\\*@\\*d up. The lobes were too short and the bowls were narrow. the ears and tits were unusually long. I redrafted the whole thing, normalizing and balancing it along the way.   \n   \nI always knew the 'hth' in \"diphthong\" was going to be problematic when put together.. most people don't pick up (read) the first 'h', they think dip-thong, but I think that has more to do with psychology and the way we read things. Regardless, I wanted it to blend together so I dropped all the upper straight serifs on the lowercase only so the \"D\" has standing power.   \nFor the uppercase, the logic for why some have serifs and some don't is purely just me. It follows my handwriting.   \n   \nThanks for the compliments, Alejandro, your work and site is fantastic too.\n\n"

      "content": "Cool face. The organic surprises make this design worth while.   \n   \nI really enjoy the contrast of the amorphous bulbous protrustions and the techie geometrics. My first reaction upon seeing it was that the inconsitencies in line widths would make for a bumpy read (the s feels thick compared to the r, for example), but upon examining your sample copy, I think it works great (from what I could see on screen). The numerals seem to lack some of the quirky flair of the lower and upper cases.\n\n"
