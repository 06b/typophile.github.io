  "content": "Hi everyone, I am hoping someone can help me to identify the font used in my iPhone app logo. I had my hard drive crash a couple of weeks ago and lost everything. I had a backup of the PSD I used to create the logo, but the font was missing and for the life of my cannot figure out which one was used. I tried looking in Photoshop for the missing font, but it doesn't seem to show. Can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130322013129im_/http:/typophile.com/files/icon%20square%20big_5433.png)\n\n",
