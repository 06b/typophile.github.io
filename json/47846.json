We're looking for something like this for a charity project, like Rockwell, but would want to have it a bit softer, and if the serifs had round endings, that would do it. We've tried it by rounding the corners on a few characters, but are wondering what's the closest existing font would be.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nEdit: Ah yes, and it shouldn't be any typewriter font.\n\n",
