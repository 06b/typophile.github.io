  "content": "Hi Typophiles,\n\nAfter incessant delays, I’m finally getting around to working on my own studio’s logotype. I previously conducted exhaustive typeface research, surveying the sans landscape for fresh and worthy entries into that classification.\n\nConsidering the studio’s core capabilities are user experience consulting and interaction/information design for screen-based media, I was looking for a typeface inspired by screen and with a single-story “a” and “g.”\n\nThe main goal of the studio is to provide superlative online experiences through interaction/information and visual design, by way of customer-centered methodologies and Web standards. I would also like to focus on type direction for corporate/brand identity, and logotypes in particular.\n\nAs far as usage of the logotype, again, it will mainly be screen-based and for basic Corporate ID materials.\n\nI have happily settled on Our Type’s/Fred Smeijers’ ( [http://www.ourtype.be/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070714142825/http:/www.ourtype.be/ \"http://www.ourtype.be/\")) excellent Sansa/Sansa Condensed. Our very own Hrant cemented the deal for me, remarking:\n\n“I just took another look at that design, and I had to smile at how much it seems to be inspired by the screen! :-)”\n\nYes, he did use an explanation point and an emoticon. :)\n\nI’ve done some sketching and exploration of the forms, and decided to set the logotype in all caps for a couple of reasons that will become apparent. My present agenda is twofold, to decide between Sansa and Sansa Condensed and to choose a weight — or a weight between weights. I have yet to purchase the fonts, so the gifs are not the final outlines, but generated by way of Our Type’s (innovative, yet slightly unwieldy) Flash GUI and screen captures.\n\nI’ll begin work on a more polished sketch of the primary concept after choosing a width and weight. To explain it literally, I’m seeing an all caps setting with no spaces between the words, and an “HD” ligature. Additionally, I want to shape either the “D” itself or it’s counter to resemble a droplet ala/originating from “SPLASH.” I’m also visualizing “SPLASH” and “DESIGN” in different colors, probably blue (think tropical water) and gray respectively. Other considerations are the possibility of lowercase forms for “e” and/or “n” in DeSIGn, but this remains to be seen as it may distract the eye from the central “HD” focus.\n\nSo, tell me what your eyes like for width and weight Typophiles...\n\nAs always, I look forward to all of your input, tutelage, humor, criticism, sketches and anything else you’d like to throw at the wall.\n\n-tim\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sansa.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20070714142825/http:/typophile.com/files/sansa.gif) | 53.93 KB |\n| [sansa-cond.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20070714142825/http:/typophile.com/files/sansa-cond.gif) | 63.67 KB |\n\n [‹ ID for a tv production company](http://web.archive.org/web/20070714142825/http:/typophile.com/node/14577 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Maui Mountain Cruisers ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070714142825/http:/typophile.com/node/14500 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I hadn’t thought of it, but I guess the A’s counter offers the possibility to introduce the droplet concept as well.\n\nWhat do you mean by “subtle” movement? Perhaps I’ll know after inspecting Avant Garde alternates. I think I’ll have a look at Mark’s Proxima Nova alternates as well.\n\n-t\n\n"

I’m not too excited about buying a typeface from them if they are unable to so much as reply to my mails. Perhaps it’s a glitch with their Flash interface?\n\nThis got me to perusing specimens again, and I came across an interesting face by Thomas Mettendorf called [**Fono**](http://web.archive.org/web/20070714142825/http:/www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens_2.html?sku=GF061008X1P2&charsets=T&start=1) in the Indie Fonts 2 book.\n\nI really like the character of this font. I think it might work even better than Sansa for my purposes (screen-based logotype and headlines/corporate identity. I’m not sure how it would do as a text face, but I can always choose another with which to pair it.\n\nWhat do _you_ think of [**Fono**](http://web.archive.org/web/20070714142825/http:/www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens_2.html?sku=GF061008X1P2&charsets=T&start=1)?

A simple auto reply or notification on the site would suffice.\n\nComments on Fono?\n\n"
