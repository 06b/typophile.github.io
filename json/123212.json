  "content": "From a book I typeset in the early 1980s using an Exxon Qyx electronic typewriter interchangeable wheel font, whose name I cannot remember. Some of their fonts were well known but this one maybe a Qyx house font. Note that the typographers quotes and apostrophe in the attached sample were not on the wheel. They were made by typing, cutting out and pasting commas.
