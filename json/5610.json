Too bad it's shareware: unfortunately, I can't get a \"good copy\" since this is all there is.   \n   \nI thought perhaps I just had the italic of some font, and was hoping to buy the complete font with roman, italic, bold, etc, but it turns out this is the whole thing. So....   \n   \nDoes anyone know of any higher quality, non-shareware fonts that look similar to this? I will be eternally grateful.   \n   \nza\n\n"
