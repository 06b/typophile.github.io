I am certainly interested in what you are doing there.\n\nIn my opinion (for whatever that is worth) I think it's rather odd to pose a sweeping statement as a fact \"moving text cannot be read.\" hang on... film credits? Stock and news tickers? TV commercials? Animated billboards? (think Times Square.) How about even static highway billboards as you drive by, does that count as moving text? The list could go on and on. If moving text could not be read, a lot of motion designers wouldn't have jobs.\n\nalso, in using the iphone, I \\*do\\* find myself reading longer format text as I scroll it (so yes, it's moving); specifically, while using NYT app and the Wikipedia app. The reader having the control of the movement makes a big difference.\n\nand also, let's remember one of David Carson's great type experiments: \"don't confuse legibility with communication.\"\n\n"

But to Hrant and James' points, it feels like a solution looking for a problem.\n\nDon't let that discourage you! There are plenty of instances where motion design and animated type can enhance meaning. We're just used to those happening on a different scale, that still has the utility of being readable. And in a mobile context it has to have utility beyond what you've shown. I think you've got some interesting concepts, especially as they relate to interacting with text in some new ways.\n\nI'd suggest starting with a problem.\n\nA mobile can be tiresome for reading long documents. The tilting document example you showed might be an interesting way to navigate a document and get a sense for its size and content (images, diagrams, callouts) but it's ineffective for actual reading in the way it's currently demoed.\n\nWhat if a reader app (ebook or RSS reader) could enlarge the text above a touch point (long press) for easier zooming without having to pinch in and out?\n\nWhat if you could slowly move your finger to scroll through a document instead of repeated flicking. What if you could tilt the device to move to the next screen instead of flicking?\n\nWhat about an educational app for beginning readers where single words react to touch. Drag the word to the object, assemble letters into words, etc.\n\n"

      "content": "_\"Motion is a very relative concept as well.\"_\n\nIs it?  \nNot at all, at least for a reading subject.  \nOne must agree that movement is relative _from a physical point of view_, but with perception, it is absolutely different, the same way that ideas such upside, down, left and right are equally absolute for a given context.  \nThere is an experiment that consists of extracting and rotating the eye of a frog\\*, let's say, 180 degrees: the frog is unable to deal with the environment because of the relative positions of things in its brain doesn't match theirs in the real world.  \n\\* Amphibious has the unusual capacity of self relinking broken neural threads.  \nIn the matter we discuss on, it has to do with the movement recognition mechanism also, that is common for all mammals and other species.  \nWhen something moves before our eyes, it triggers a complex series of reactions to determine what kind of movement is happening, and act accordingly (it is unnecessary to say that most of these reactions are ancient reflexs).  \nBut our perception doesn't work estrictly under the general principle of action and reaction: it is selective, some attenuations –that can reach even the cancellation of stimuli– and some boosts occur, in order to allow us to discern what matters and what doesn't; reactions have inherited distortions.  \nBeyond that reading is a cultural behavior, an ordinary reader is unavoidably determined for some basic questions such as position, angle, brightness, contrast, sequential sorting, pattern recognition, focus, distance, size, weight, and so on; worse: the eyes move in three different ways:\n\n- Individual eye movement (duction)\n- Same direction eyes movement (version)\n- Opposite direction eyes movement (vergence)\n\nIt's almost pointless to tell that when a text moves in any way, reading becomes a harder task for our visual short term memory processing system, mainly because parameters that are supposed to be constant become variable (you know how hard it can be to read the credits at the end of a film movie when scrolling), but also because we cannot keep focus on such a complex situation that requires all of our conscious.  \nMoving texts make us considerably more sensitive to failure phenomena like inattentional, choice, and change blindness, obscuration, noising; they are not only related to movement itself, but to the kind of movement.  \nIn the end, it's all determined by our mind map, that is our way of knowing the world, in which position is almost everything (by the way, the Moon seems bigger on the horizon 'cause four our mind map the universe is an overwhelmed sphere).  \nI once learned –and it didn't change since then– that Relativity fits in its own field, the same way that Quantum Mechanics only works at atomic level; so I'm reluctant to such generalizations as saying _\"I feel kind of shocked by the narrow-mindedness (lack of relativity if you prefer...)\"_.  \nI agree that these experiments are _\"cool in terms of being artsy, being somewhat visually interesting, and showing off the potential of the iPhone\"_, in Nina's words. Nevertheless, speaking of a humane interface, in that case, is as far as the distance between the Myth of Oedipus (art) and the Oedipus Complex (science?).  \nArt is inspiring; then, it starts the modest-hard-slow-constrained work of design.  \nDesign, in my humble opinion, is mainly a matter of modesty.\n\n**MarS**\n\n"

In that sense, I'm not being restrictive by compartmenting things analytically (analysis is a huge tool, but must be used carefully, and many times ruled out); I'm just attempting to use adjectivations more properly.\n\n**MarS**\n\n"
