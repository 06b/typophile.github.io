Until a while ago when I saw it at [www.graficeurope.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050817173951/http:/www.graficeurope.com/) and realised that i probably is! But i dont know the name of the font, or where to get it. Does anyone know?   \nThanks!   \nPeter   \n ![What font is this?](http://web.archive.org/web/20050817173951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49276.jpg)\n\n",
