  "content": "For Immediate Release:  \nBuffalo, NY, March 1, 2007:\n\nP22 and Lanston Type Company announce 24 new font styles plus “Pro” options.\n\nThe latest installment of Lanston releases features several Frederic Goudy classics and some rare treasures too. The highlights of the collection feature a couple of Goudy firsts that include Camelot, Goudy’s first typeface design and Goudy Modern, his first attempt at a “Modern” face. Interestingly, he designed the variant Goudy Open first and then made the solid version of Goudy Modern.\n\nIn addition, the new releases include more Goudy with expansions to the Blackletter font Goudy Text, as well as Globe Gothic and Hadriano, based on letter rubbings from Goudy at The Louvre in Paris, 1910. Another new Goudy release is Record Title, as digitized by Jim Rimmer, and re-mastered and released for the first time by P22/Lanston.\n\nOne last Goudy gem is Goudy Ornate with a newly designed lower case to complement the all Caps style designed by Goudy in 1931. The final release of this month is not from Frederic Goudy at all. It is Keystone Ornaments, a set of surprisingly modern geometric decorative borders and cuts from the Keystone foundry in 1903.\n\nAll new releases are delivered in PostScript and TrueType formats as well as basic OpenType format.\n\nIn other news, RTF Canadian Syllabics, developed as a metal typeface by Jim Rimmer for a special project, is now available in digital form. Containing over 700 glyphs in OpenType format, this font covers most Canadian Aboriginal languages.\n\nLinks for all of the above can be found here:  \n [http://www.p22.com/blog/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070302153252/http:/www.p22.com/blog/)\n\n",
