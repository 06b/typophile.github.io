Too bad the family is quite pricey, there’s propably no way to purchase just one weight?\n\nThe face I’m looking for is a classic sans with a “weak personality”. Something that Reid Miles would have put on a record cover in the 50s/early 60s. Just an extremely small sprinkle of modern flavor might be a good thing.\n\nI like Mark Simonsons Proxima Sans Black, just hoping it was a bit wider. It has some modern flair, yet quite classic.\n\n"
