  "content": "Hi,  \nI would like to know if someone could help to find which semi-serif font is used to write \"MASAHIRO (S)HINODA\" on [this packaging](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824010311/http:/www.asia-tik.com/images/stories/films/shinoda/pack1).  \nI know this is a font because I have this DVD pack and it is used to write a lot of texts.  \nAfter few search and with help on WhatTheFont Forum, it cames that Manfred Klein could be the author.  \nFont as [CrazyCrazy](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824010311/http:/www.dafont.com/fr/crazycrazy.font?text=MASAHIRO+SHINODA) is very close but not a perfect match... Hope it helps...  \nThanks in advance.\n\n",

It seems also that there is two weights, regular and bold and all text initials are caps and semi-serifs... So that’s why I have concluded this is a font...  \nIt is as ITC Galliard semi-serif has come to life...\n\n"
