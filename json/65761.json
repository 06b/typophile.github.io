Finally, I took a picture, and submitted that to MyFonts’ electronic match, but although that let me find Adobe Present from the Omniglot logo, it didn’t find the match for this one:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103065550im_/http:/typophile.com/files/word_4581.jpg)\n\nThis seems to be a plain but calligraphic font... but I don’t think they used hand lettering. (Although the letters did have a 3-D effect, so I suppose it’s possible...)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103065550im_/http:/typophile.com/files/word4_5634.jpg)\n\nAnd here’s another sample. I would think this should be simple and obvious to find, but it has turned out not to be.\n\n",

And Scrivano and Amanda were also fonts I noticed in my frantic searches. I also referred to some print references I have as well, but I have a few others buried in clutter I need to dig out and look at.\n\nAs you’ve pointed out, there are letterspacing problems, so it may be that this is a very obscure font; I was hoping that there would still be a much closer match that is a real and well-known font - since the shape of the letters seemed familiar to me - but maybe I was wrong.\n\n"

Also, in the samples I provided, I see I failed to include one with a significant distinguishing feature of the design. The bottom right-pointing serif of the lowercase L is so big that it can be mistaken for an uppercase L. Another reason to think that it’s likely just some amateur calligraphy.\n\nBut I still saw much of what I was looking for, because even if I can’t find an exact match, identifying that font was just a part of my search for alternatives to Papyrus - and I did find several of those in that area.\n\n"
