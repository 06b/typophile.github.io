I have just had an email from the designer and it was done especially for the Glen Street Theatre re-branding campaign a couple of years ago. The designer is Mark Gowing [http://www.markgowing.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20071103183005/http:/www.markgowing.com/) Sorry for putting anyone to any trouble. The typeface has no name and may become commercially available in a couple of years.\n\n"
