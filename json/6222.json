The conference team has to spend a huge amount of energy simply to stay on top of all the aspects of the conference that have been planned for, to keep everything running smoothly. They do not have time to come up with creative solutions to every unforseen circumstance, although they must handle many unexpected things; their priority must always be to concentrate on the steady operation of the conference as planned.   \n   \nBy the way, by Sunday morning a lot of people who had received tokens for the book had not picked up their copy yet, because they were waiting until the last minute so they would not have to carry it around. I doubt very much if anyone on the team was keeping a tally of the books: it wasn't a priority. As to giving the books away: it would have cost ATypI a lot of money to ship them back to England, and then what should have been done with them? They would still be sitting in Sharon Moncur's office, waiting for the additional expense of moving them somewhere from where they _might_ be sold and some money might filter back to the association.   \n   \nFinally (and I mean finally, because this is a bloody silly conversation), let me recount another circumstance of the conference. I produced 150 copies of a software CD to be distributed to attendees of the Font Technology Forum. I guessed we would have a max of 100 attendees, but I didn't want to run the risk of not having enough. I paid to have the CDs produced and to have them shipped to Rome. In the end, I had about 60 left over, which were handed back to me by the conference team on the Sunday afternoon. What did I do? I wandered around and handed them out to anyone who happened to be in the lobby. Now, I'm sure there are some people who would have liked a copy who didn't get one, and there are some people I would have liked to give one to whom I didn't see in the lobby at that time. If I'd thought about the CDs at any time after the Thursday afternoon, I would have realised that there were extra copies that could be handed out to 'deserving' people. Frankly, the CDs were the last thing on my mind.   \n   \nIf I had been one of the people who carried away an armful of books to save them from an ignominious fate, I would glady send a copy to anyone who did not receive one in Rome who was willing to pay postage. As it is, I only have one extra copy, but I'll send it to Matha if he shuts up about it.\n\n"

We should all strive to make this a truly global community; I think we're making great strides.   \n   \nBased on Hrant's post, which has a delightful air of challenge, I will point out that [SOTA](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108035004/http:/www.typesociety.org/) has a history of offering inexpensive membership fees and conference admission.   \n   \nSOTA already offers a reduced membership fee of $35USD per year for all members residing outside North America. This membership level is deemed Global Professional, and carries the exact same benefits as the regular Professional membership level (which is $60USD).   \n   \nThe annual SOTA conference, TypeCon, is already priced so low that I don't know how it could go any lower, unless SOTA were awarded some outrageous endowment (not that we're not trying!). Registration is under $150USD for professionals, and less than $100USD for students. When we announce the exact admission fees for [TypeCon2003](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108035004/http:/www.typecon2003.com/) in a few weeks, I think people will be pleasantly surprised. SOTA members receive a 20% discount off conference admission. Speakers and volunteers get in free.   \n   \nFor the price of conference admission, TypeCon2003 includes 3 days of programming (accompanied by refreshments; ask Ray Larabie about the cookies), free admission to some very cool evening events, and more of the good things you expect from an event produced by our community.   \n   \nIf anyone wants to discuss SOTA and TypeCon further, let's move over to the [SOTA SIG](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108035004/http:/www.typophile.com/sota) here at Typophile.

Never even thought it.   \n   \nYou didn't say it, but it seems to me that you're accusing people of playing favourites over the distribution of the books - to me this indicative of an accusation of some form of malice.   \n   \nIf you're not saying there was some favouritism in the distribution, then clearly there's no malice either.   \n   \n\\>\\>No one's thinking about books   \n   \n\\>Bingo   \n   \nWhat do you want them to do, think about books or deal with lost badges/general enquiries/take registrations/make sure the speakers are where they're supposed to be/make sure the food's where it's supposed to be...   \n   \nThere's a lot going on. A pile of books that's not shouting out \"What about me, me, me?\" is just a pile of books until it becomes a problem when packing up.   \n   \nSomeone solved the problem as best they could - what is the issue? That books that cost the org nothing were given away for nothing, rather than being binned?\n\n"

      "content": "\\>The issue is obvious - I don't want to repeat myself.   \n   \nThe issue, as you've explained is that someone got to take six books (or perhaps even seven) rather than one, due to a administrative error. The error being caused by fewer people turning up and someone not really paying attention to a pile of inert books in a corner.   \n   \nAs there's no accusation of malice or favouritism I'm not sure what your complaint constitutes. I'm sure the org is always happy to have volunteer organisers to sit at a desk all day, seeing nothing of the conference itself and having little time to socialise either.   \n   \nPerhaps you could put yourself forward for Vancouver, I'm sure John would be happy to hear from you, and you can personally ensure that such an outrage never ocurrs again.   \n   \n\\>?!?!?!   \n   \nFacts?\n\n"

The reason for that person walking away with a case of books, as John explains, was due to an administrative error - no one was assigned to be book monitor.   \n   \nI took it that you didn't dispute John's explanation so therefore believed that your complaint was that the administration of books should be completed to a higher standard?   \n   \nIs that not correct? What piece of the above is \"made up\"?   \n   \nIf I've got it wrong please let me know - and please let me know what your complaint is, exactly.   \n   \n\\>While I'm sure you'll understand that I don't believe you.   \n   \nI'm sure you'll understand I find it difficult to follow your rationale.
