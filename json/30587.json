But don't forget to update your page titles :-)\n\nIf I might kibbitz a little more (sorry!), I would also suggest maybe moving the \"more stuff\" link over to the rest of your navigation and changing it to something like \"logos\" or \"samples.\"\n\nI know you didn't ask for suggestions & maybe you're still working on it, so I apologize if this comes across as nitpicky.\n\n"

That was a great Idea, Inagres. I think i will make that change. Suggestions are very welcome as I am new to this.\n\n:)  \n-Charles\n\n"

You’ll find the title in the beginning, between \\<title\\> and \\</title\\>\n\nI really love your lettering. Good to know I can buy from Myfonts.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, Charles. I'm glad you took my suggestion in the spirit it was intended. Criticism from strangers on the internet can be very annoying.\n\nTo expand on what Grot Esqué said, I would suggest changing each page title to something descriptive. So your homepage title might become \"Charles Borges Lettering\" and the page for your commercial fonts could be \"Charles Borges Lettering: Fonts\" etc.\n\nThe page title is what shows up by default when someone bookmarks your site (as I did!) in their web browser.\n\nI believe that descriptive, relevant page titles also help your site become more visible search engines.\n\n"
