  "content": "Hello\n\nWe are pitching for a souvenir publication for a Jazz festival. We want to keep the type beautiful, crafted and yet humanist. Our thinking ws to give Stag Rounded a tryout for the headers and maybe the sans for the body, but the sans isn't quite hitting the mark. We wondered about using Gotham or Whitney but again something missing. We'd like to keep the rounded element, so can anyone suggest pairings for Stag rounded? Serif or sans would be welcome at this point - just remember it's about Jazz!\n\nThanks\n\n",
