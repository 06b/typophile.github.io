I agree with Nathanael, the letter spacing does seem a bit tight and the flow of lowercase letters is jumpy, the uppercase forms seem pretty solid though.\n\nNot to nit-pick, but you misspelled Copyright.\n\n"

Chance?  \nDo not I know, therefore I have the sketches of the Adriane to at least two years.\n\nJelmar,  \nThanks by the comments. I am going to evaluate its observation about the 'e'.\n\nReed,  \nReally not with himself see resemblances between the Adriane and to Farnhan.\n\nEdward,  \nI am going to analyze with its calm observation.\n\nP.s. am preparing a new sample brought up to date, and soon I will place.\n\nMarconi\n\n"

Although I think that the E is a bit too narrow. And make the G a bit wider at the top.\n\nAnd I have to agree Quincunx Im although not such a big fan of the small counter in the e and the crossbar is a bit too small.\n\nSteven\n\n"
