  "content": "The inspiration behind this one is the Volkswagen Radio station. Strictly done as an exercise for myself. They had the word radio created and I went from there. I like the idea of a single stroke typeface that only changes in weight. The problem with this, of course, is that by the time I created my ultra-mega fat (not shown) the counters were gone.   \n   \n ![volks.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416061635im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/986.gif)   \n ![volksfig.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416061635im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/987.gif)\n\n",

Some other forms need work (like the leftward-leaning \"z\", the simply-too-strange \"r\", the too-narrow \"x\"), but I'd love to see some lines in this thing. Extra-large, on white bread, please!   \n   \nBTW, I prefer the second \"f\".   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I wonder if its   \nshape could be better implemented throughout   \nthe alphabet.   \n   \nI like the idea on the 'w' and 'm' but the extra   \nspace between the curved and straight lines   \ndistracts me.   \n   \nNice work, Tiffany!   \n   \nStephen\n\n"

      "content": "Tiffany:   \n   \nI like this very much.   \n   \nI especially like the creativity behind decisions such as the \"e\" and the first \"r\" (or is that \"R\"?). The figures are especially fun, notably that rising \"0\" (zero).   \n   \nThe \"x\" does seem narrow, but I'll reserve judgement until I can see it in context of a setting.   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
