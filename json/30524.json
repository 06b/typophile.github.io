I would also encourage making as many visual improvements until someone says something. I'm constantly tweaking forms and factsheets that were created by some number cruncher using powerpoint.\n\n**It brings up an interesting side question:** _Should I feel ethically wrong if I tweak a non trademarked logo?_\n\nI'm constantly working with Government and Military logos that are either exist as small raster images, or as a horribly outdated and poorly created vector EPS. On more than one occasion, I've had to re-vectorize one or more of these logos for a project. I'd take the opportunity to then \"tweaked\" them, typography and all.\n\n"
