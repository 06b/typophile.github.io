Right now I am using [Estilo Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322043323/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/estilo-script/) and I am more or less happy with that, but I am wondering if there are any better options out there. It could be either sans serif or script.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322043323im_/http:/typophile.com/files/estiloscript-example_4566.jpg)\n\nSecond, a font that feels similar to the letters in Restraint. I am not looking for an exact match, just something similar in weight and structure. Spiky serifs would be nice too.\n\nAny ideas are appreciated.\n\n",

I happen to like my Copper Penny. It is perfectly suited to the need for which it was intended. I must admit, looking back there are some things that need to be fixed. Besides which, there is at least one other Copper Plate Gothic with a lower case: [American Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322043323/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/american-gothic/) from URW.\n\n:Þ\n\n"

The weight and heavier serifs aren't destroyed during routing, sand blasting or vinyl applications. Most versions of Copperplate Gothic don't work very well for the sign industry because of weak serifs. This wouldn't be an issue except it is a very popular font for architectural signs.\n\n"
