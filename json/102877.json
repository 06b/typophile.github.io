And this would be of a huge benefit in keeping the Type ID requests in the right place!\n\nSo, as I said - two birds with one stone.\n\n",

I figure something like a half dozen or so around planet Earth should do.\n\nType ID request showing up everywhere all over, I was thinking we could create a filter that would be 'trained' to redirect a Type ID request to the Type ID forum. I have notice that most every Type ID request has key words in them such as \\>\\>\\> help, does anyone, please identify, \\<\\<\\< etc.. Spam filters use word recognition so I don't see why we couldn't do the same for a Type Id filter?\n\n"

My guess (and it's just a guess) is that the spam filters already weed out most of the spam so the number of first-time posts to review each day wouldn't be that huge, but I don't really know for sure as there are some forums at Typophile that I don't read.\n\n"

Outside of Type ID new user accounts I'd guess that between 0-5 new user accounts are generated everyday.\n\nSo if that is about all, then I'm guessing that a 24hour account approval period would not realize all that much of a drop in overall forum activity ...maybe?\n\n"

These were mostly what I call “sleeper” spam accounts – dummy accounts with spam links in profile fields. And sometimes one of these “users” would surface after several months (or even a year) and post a spam thread.\n\n"
