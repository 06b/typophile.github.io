      "content": "Hi typomania,\n\nI would definitely recommend you to do the introduction on type design here on typophile: [http://typophile.com/courses/type110](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052314/http:/typophile.com/courses/type110)\n\nAfter that you could give your work another try, right now it looks very cluttered, the geometric sans style you've chosen has been heavily replenished on fonts like Futura, Avantgarde, Avenir, DIN Font or ITC Kabel. Look at these fonts and examine them keenly in terms of style, form, aesthetic, harmony, rhythm & proportion. If you haven't capitulated to that point start reworking your font. ;-)\n\nLinks:  \n [http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052314/http:/www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics)  \n [http://www.chank.com/howto/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052314/http:/www.chank.com/howto/)  \n [http://briem.ismennt.is/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052314/http:/briem.ismennt.is/)\n\n"
