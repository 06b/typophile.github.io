Then, I came upon a section in my Sam's 24-hour book on Illustrator that dealt with this with a couple of exercises. By golly, I had an aha! moment! I can do beziers!--and with more practice, I'll be able to do them well.   \n   \nTheresa\n\n"

Instead I downloaded a cartoon still--Stimpy--off the wed and drew over it in Illustrator. Btw. cartoons work best bec. they temd to have a lot of flat colour.   \n   \nIt only took about an hour and it really helped me to figure illustrator out for myself. Plus Stimpy freaking ROCKS.\n\n"
