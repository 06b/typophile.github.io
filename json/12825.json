I can't see why any internet user would not mind \"going through the trouble\" of downloading the plug-in…\n\nHowever, typophile \\*does\\* work without the flash parts… I was at a conference center in the middle of nowhere last week… internet access, but the computers did not have flash installed! I surfed Typophile anyway.  \n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108172821/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"

      "content": "_I like the flash interface. Almost every browser in use today supports flash._\n\nYep. That's true. But really has nothing to do with user preferences.\n\nI've installed FlashBlock on most of my browsers. This has made the web so much nicer. Granted, it makes sIFR rather annoying.\n\nI don't MIND the flash on this site, but it's not really necessary. It also messes up my javascript fix a bit that changes the width of the forums, but that's my doing, I suppose. ;o)\n\nMy BIGGEST gripe with the flash navigation is that I can't launch pages into new tabs.\n\n"

I can't middle-click to launch any of those pages in a new tab. Not a terrible hurdle, since I spend most of my time in the forums, but just another reason to avoid Flash navigation most of the time.\n\n"
