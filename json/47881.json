However, this font doesn’t suit all our needs so we thought we’d try to make our own.\n\nThe problem is - can you make a font that is already coloured? (See, I have no idea about fonts at all :D) I ask, because we want anything that is white in our font \\*not\\* to be transparent. As it is, anything white can actually be seen through. I’m looking for some kind of white fill to put on the white bits of the font.\n\nAny help for an utter novice will be appreciated.\n\nThank you for your patience!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [note font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015001128/http:/typophile.com/files/note%20font.jpg) | 31.69 KB |\n\n [‹ What t\\_f ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015001128/http:/typophile.com/node/49792 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fonts with variable metrics ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015001128/http:/typophile.com/node/48985 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Applying multiple colors to rendered fonts takes any variety of graphic design programs to do.\n\nI have no idea how that might be handled with the more specialized nature of musical notation layout tools, though.\n\n"

For example, an “e” could be any solid color with a transparent hole through it, which would appear white so long as the background is white, but you cannot have an “i” that has a black shaft but also a red dot without using some graphics software that can separate the parts.\n\nThe holes in the letters like “e” are not white, but transparent (i.e, there is nothing there). If you are laying text over the music staff, the intersecting lines will appear between the letters and through these holes. You will either have to reduce the size of the type so it fits between the lines or move it to a non-interfering area outside the staff.\n\n"

      "content": "I think I understand what you want. You could create separations; that is, two fonts with identical metrics, one with the outlines and one with the fills. Then when you’re using the font, you would duplicate your finished “text”, change the font to the fill font, change the color to white, and put it behind the original (and in front of the staff). Of course, you would have to do that over again every time you changed something.\n\nHowever, I think the easiest solution to your _specific_ problem might be instead to incorporate the staff into the font. For the purposes it will be used for, do you expect to be combining the notes into chords?\n\n"

We are revisiting this issue again so I thought I’d write back in here instead of starting a new topic.\n\nThe notes will be combined into chords, yes. I create all of my scores in Finale (or perhaps Sibelius for these particular scores). Most things are automatic (stave lines etc).\n\nI don’t know why they would make this font and advertise it when it looks so terrible. And there is definitely no font designing program which will fill the transparent space with white? (If my company were to create their own notation font).  \nThank you again....\n\n"
