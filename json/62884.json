I've been reading the complaint and looking at the exhibits - all of it available via Scribd links in the article. (Ya gotta love the web.)  \nI now doubly hope this goes to a decision and not a settlement because then there will be an extensive transcript, too.\n\nTwo facts stand out to me so far:\n\n1) The three fonts Font Bureau is claiming to have been infringed are \"Bureau Grotesque\", \"Antenna\", and \"Interstate\".  \nI am now deeply interested to what degree those fonts can be considered \"original expression\".  \nI would imagine this would also be one line of defense for NBC.\n\n2) The invoice to NBC for those fonts (bought online) is being used as prima facia evidence that NBC both obtained (paid for it, certainly) and used (presumably) those fonts in violation - or so plaintiff says - of Font Bureau's EULA.  \nI'm sure it will also be claimed that the invoice amounts to a tacit acknowledgment by NBC that said fonts are, indeed, copyrightable and that the license terms are, therefore, legit.\n\nBut since there are so many typefaces nearly identical in design, and the designers at a behemoth like NBC would surely experiment with many different fonts before making a decision, how is it going to be ascertained that NBC did, indeed, use these three exact fonts?\n\nFascinating.\n\nThe simple truth is that any font designer can bring a suit claiming infringement against anyone and do so relatively cheaply. But defending against it can be very expensive no matter how off-the-mark it may be.  \nHowever, if the basis of the complaint is just a similarity in _look_, it's a rather thin argument. Bolstering it with a documented purchase, however, much stronger.\n\nUnfortunately, for some, the lesson here might be to think twice before buying **any** commercial font.\n\nThis isn't a football game where one roots for one or the other \"side\". There's always two sides and real-world consequences.\n\nAwesome.\n\n"

Same with fonts.\n\nThat said, the USCO has explicitly recognised that fonts are may be copyrighted as computer programs, and the summary judgement in the Adobe vs. SSi case confirmed that this pertains also to the outlines, so even if this were an IP case I don't think there would be any question of the eligibility of the fonts to protection.\n\n_Do they do Columbus Day in Canada._\n\nNo. It's our Thanksgiving weekend up here, an end-of-harvest festival.\n\nBy the way, it's Frank Martinez, not Herb Martinez.\n\n"

OK, understood.  \nBut if the thing is not protected in the first place, there is no \"right to use\" to be obtained in the first place. The idea of a license, a \"right to use\" is predicated on copyright.  \nSorry, sometimes I'm thick, but what you seem to be saying is that anything can be licensed, and the license can be enforced, even if the licensor has no claim on the item after transfer.  \nTo use the analogy one more time: you seem to be saying that if I buy an egg from you under the terms of a contract that says I'm only to eat it hard-boiled but, dammit, you've got pictures of me eating it scrambled, that you can claim damages because it's going to be harder to license more eggs to other clients in the future. (As the Font Bureau's complaint puts it. But no eggs, of course.)  \nThe only problem with this is that you never had any rights to the egg in the first place because it was just an egg, so that leaves you with only breach of contract and what damages could you legitimately claim?  \nI don't call up Herman Miller to license a chair. I don't go to the local Honda dealership to license a car.  \nAfter I've purchased those things I can do what I want with them, period. I own them lock, stock, and barrel.  \nLicensing a \"right to use\" the font software is dependent upon the font software being protected IP. Otherwise, there may be a nonsensical contract, but there is no license.  \nAre you saying otherwise?\n\n(I'll pass on the significance or lack thereof, of Adobe v Southern Software other than to say I've read the decision.)\n\nEnd of harvest, eh?

The idea is that as the owner of a copyright, one has exclusive rights to do a few things with that copyrighted work. Generally one can sell or conditionally license these rights.

Thus NBC could try to challenge whether Font Bureau owns any rights to the fonts, and hence whether their EULA is a legally binding contract.\n\nBut then NBC would in effect be challenging whether any software EULA for fonts is valid. In light of SSI vs Abobe, I doubt they would be successful, and hence probably NBC won't try this strategy. I am just guessing, as I have no training in law.\n\nBecause SSI vs Adobe established protection of fonts as software, and undoubtedly software was licensed from Font Bureau and used by NBC, I don't think that an argument about the originality of these particular fonts as designs would be relevant, as they would pass the test of SSI for original software. Again, lawyers can try any argument, but I don't see how it would work before a judge.\n\nAlso re-litigating SSI vs Adobe would likely be an expensive matter for NBC to do, which they would want to do only if they were concerned to establish a principle important to their business. And I don't see how this is. To put this into perspective, according to one figure I just found it costs 3 million dollars to produce one hour of a sitcom. In contrast, paying for new fonts each year will be a tiny fraction of that.\n\n"

A quick settlement is what is being sought and what will, probably, be gotten.  \nProlonged litigation is fabulously expensive.  \nOn the Martinez group's web site (link to the litigation page is in a previous comment), it's made clear that settlement is the aim.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer. The following is nothing more than opinion and reportage of the legal precautions and calculations that take place in the world.\n\nTo continue, Bill:  \nWhere NBC screwed up is in buying the font online using a NBC credit card or somesuch. It proves access and gives the complaint legs. It's much more difficult to prove access without it. It's the last time NBC will be doing that, I assume.  \nAnd it would not surprise me if this ran counter to existing policies within NBC.  \nBusinesses with deep-pockets are constantly sued. Some suits are legit, some concocted. But it's routine to create barriers to potential liability such as using shell entities to conduct business, etc., to provide a shield.  \nFor example, if the design department were to be spun off as a single-client entity - a business of it's own - it would be much more difficult to drag NBC into the fray.  \nAnd the bells that went off at Font Bureau when NBC purchased those fonts would not have rung, most probably.  \nMy feeling is that from the day of that purchase onward they were being stalked for any sign that the basic license had been exceeded. I do not know if Font Bureau's claim is true or not. But the whole idea of a purchase triggering a surveillance of sorts, I find a little creepy. I mean, do _you_ think someone at FB just woke up one day and said, \"Hey! There's our fonts on Jay Leno!\"  \nInstead of NBC it could be me or you or anybody, really.  \nI recently bought a particular weight of Kent Lew's font \"Whitman\" from the Font Bureau. And it gives me pause.  \n(Well, more than pause, but another time and place, not here.)  \nAnyway, perhaps because so much of NBC's core business is copyright related, it simply isn't (or wasn't) worth the confusion for them to take these precautions, who knows.\n\nThe world we live in.

When fonts are used in such a high profile way, I think it is sensible for foundries to check their license sales logs. The fonts are contributing massive added value to the media corporations campaign, and should be properly licensed and paid for. Further, as explained during the web fonts discussions, much of the value in fonts, for the professional designers who are the principle market for font licensing, resides in real, partial or perceived exclusivity. If major TV network ‘A’ are using specific fonts in their season branding, other networks will want to avoid using the same fonts so that their own branding is not diluted. So high profile font use by one major customer diminishes the likelihood of licensing by other customers in the same business or marketplace. Hence the basis of potential damages. If NBC had properly licensed the fonts to use them in the ways in which they intended to use them, they would have reasonably compensated Font Bureau for the likely loss of other sales.\n\n"

Did you read the lawsuit filing? I mean, yes, the six causes of action are all predicated on the idea that the EULA NBC had (a single-user license for just one of the three families in question, namely Interstate) did not permit NBC to do what they did. But if NBC had never had a license at all, five of the six causes of action would all still be there; only \"breach of contract\" would go away.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
