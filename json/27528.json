Any leads? I'd love to find something free, if possible, but any sort of direction someone could point me in would be appreciated, free or not!  \nThanks a million...  \nSarah\n\n",

I did the search through google though that was suggested, and think I found my answer (although unfortunately not the answer I was hoping for!) Perhaps I'll have to switch directions on the font search and use something different. I'm feeling a bit sheepish about looking for the font in the first place, as I'm fairly certain that the second anyone sees the design they're going to go \"Isn't that the font from...\". Sigh. I hate it when you know the perfect font for something, but it just won't work...\n\n"
