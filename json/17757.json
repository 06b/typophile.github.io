  "content": "Hello Typophiles,\n\nI don’t know what’s the norm for english or other languages, but in portuguese, when one suppresses part of a quoting (for brevity), it must be indicated by an ellipsis enclosed in brackets.\n\nAs I’m typesetting my graduation monograph, I have been trying to decide what’s the best “typographic detail” to this. Examples below show three situations:\n\n1) Bracket / Three Periods / Bracket — The standard when writing, and what most people deliver because they write in Word and print from Word.  \n2) Bracket / Ellipsis / Bracket — Straight-forward replacing the three periods with an ellipsis. This is the first, obvious choice when one goes beyong option 1. I like the way the space between each period in the ellipsis kind of equals the space from the brackets to the periods.  \n3) Bracket / Thin Space / Ellipsis / Thin Space / Bracket — This starts to get wide, but in a way I like it, because the larger space around the ellipsis kind of emphasizes it, and the “wideness” of the group seems to reinforce the idea that there was more to that particular sentence than what is shown.\n\nThe problem with this kind of decision is that what may look interesting to me (ie. option 3), might be annoying to readers. So I would like know what everyone else thinks… other approaches are also welcome :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/ellipsis-gabriel.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I like number two at first glance, but, because this might be occuring several times on a page, you would run the risk of creating light spots, so while retaining the ellipsis I would look at making this combination tighter, reducing spaces before and after brackets and the space between bracket and first letter (unless that is part of the convention). Also are square brackets the norm or can you use parentheses, especially if they are lighter overall, as the strong verticals are drawing attention to the space.  \nThe trouble with these is the emoticon factor I suppose, it could be perceived as a [Keith Haring icon.](http://web.archive.org/web/20070306215447/http:/www.artcellarexchange.com/images/artists/haring_monster.jpg)  \nTim\n\n"
