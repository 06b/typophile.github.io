It looks like due to tech restrictions I must use a fixed width font for a project that, preferably, is commonly used by Microsoft Word (for the ease of our illustrious customers, doncha know). I can't seem to find a list of fixed width fonts that are found by default in Word. Could someone at least point me to a place where I could find such info? Googling and searching Microsoft's site didn't seem to help.\n\n",
