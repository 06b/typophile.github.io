Revised [Twentieth Century Medium](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/twentiethcen.html) features alternates based on the original experimental [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura) by [Paul Renner](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%252BRenner).  \n Brand new digitizations of classic Lanston metal faces include [Artscript](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/artscript.html), [Nicolas Cochin](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/cochin.html), [Remington Typewriter](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/remington.html) and [Goudy Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/goudytext.html)...all with alternates and all optionally in expanded OpenType format. Additionally we have an exclusive digitization of the very rare [Hess Monoblack](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/hmonoblack.html) plus new [Ornaments 2](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/ornaments2.html) and remastered [Ornaments 3.](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/ornaments3.html)\n\n[The full Lanston collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/catalog.html) is currently over 135 fonts PLUS over 40 OpenType fonts. Purchased individually, the fonts would cost over $2500. Buy them all now for only $999.95 (current owners of previous Lanston collections may upgrade at a very reasonable price. Please [inquire](mailto:p22@p22.com) for details). _BUT WAIT_ there’s more! If you license the full Lanston Collection this month, you will get the next installment at no additional charge (plus the [William Caslon Experience CD](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/products/cds.html)). Planned for early 2006, the next installment will include most of the remaining digital fonts from the Giampa era Lanston Type Co. including: [Record Title](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/Giampa/Record-Title-Goudy.html), [Kaatskill](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/Lanston/Giampa/Kaatskill.html), and [Jenson Oldstyle](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/Giampa/JensonRoman.html). In all, over 30 fonts will be included in the next installment. Final selection is still under consideration.\n\n**A New Foundry!?**  \nMany Lanston fonts were originally digitized by the multi-talented [](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.heavenlymonkey.com/Rimmer.htm) [Jim Rimmer](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jim%252BRimmer). Other titles offered by Lanston over the last two decades included the original Jim Rimmer designs: [Albertan](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/Giampa/Albertan.html), [Alexander Quill](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/Giampa/Alexander-Quill-Font.html) and [Posh Initials](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/Giampa/Posh-Initials.html). These design plus many more Jim Rimmer fonts, will be offered exclusively through P22 in January 2006. The _ **Rimmer Type Foundry** _ at P22 will feature all of Mr. Rimmer’s digital type designs while he spends his time working on [making metal type and fine press books](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.heavenlymonkey.com/Rimmer.htm).\n\n**Roycroft Book Arts**  \n_So what is the allure of metal type and fine press books in the digital age?_ We ask that question ourselves all the time. [P22](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/typophile.com/wiki/P22) makes digital fonts, but the source for so many P22 fonts goes back to the days of hand crafted printing. As part of the continuing tradition of connecting the old and the new, P22 is proud to be the co-organizer of the **[“Roycroft Book-Arts Weekend”](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181229/http:/www.p22.com/bookarts.htm)** in East Aurora New York. October 14-16. Spots are still open for this historic Arts and Crafts renaissance workshop series on the very campus that helped launch the American Arts and Crafts movement in the late 19th century. But Hurry!  \n**Fonts-in-Use Contest**  \nHave a look at September’s winning entry in our ever-popular [Fonts-in-Use Contest](http://web.archive.org/fontsinuse.html). You can enter too.
