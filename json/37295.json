  "content": "Dear forum,\n\nI'm getting a subtable overflow while trying to compile my features within FL Studio.  \nNow I tried building the kern feature with FDK, but still I'm getting an overflow. No mixing up different scripts within the classes and also kerning should not be too much (3400 pairs, when expanded 152k).  \n_GPOS feature 'kern' causes overflow of offset to a subtable (0x11a00)_\n\nAlso there's quite a lot of this stuff:  \n_Pair positioning has two different values in 'kern' feature; choosing the smaller absolute value: Q comma_  \nwhich seem to be my exceptions.\n\nAny idea?\n\nThank you,\n\nChris\n\n",

I think you should check your class definitions first.  \nAbout 3400 kerning pairs <cite>may be</cite> (but not necessarily are) critical. If you generate fonts with AFDKO 2, you can also try to kick out lines with \"subtable break\" and add an explicit lookup definition with 'useExtension', so your kern feature looks like this (please exchange parentheses by braces):\n\nfeature kern (  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup kern0 useExtension (  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pos A B 12;  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pos B C 32;  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) kern0;  \n) kern;\n\nBut mind that FLS5 cannot compile this, and that such a kern feature will be interpreted only by a few OT-savvy applications like those of Creative Suite.\n\n"
