  "content": "Hello every one,\n\nI am a student at the City College of New York and is doing my thesis now,  \nMy thesis is about signage system in a 3-d form/ structure.\n\nand is in search of a nice serif font to go with the system.  \nI am working on the sketch for the structure now.\n\nbut I am wondering if anyone has information on the fonts choice that's  \nsuitable for such project?  \nnicely defined san serif fonts and maybe with some variations?\n\nany reply is greatly appreciated. again,\n\nthanks all,  \neric\n\n",
