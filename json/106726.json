In this case both of them have previously published quite original fonts and it's true, there are similarities, but I have a feeling that each designer had a different philosophy when creating these fonts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803044513im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sg_4802.gif)\n\n"

Both samples are screenshots from MyFonts. I have adjusted the spacing of Center to match Geogrotesque. The image is wider than the column, but I leave it the way it is, so that you can judge for yourself at the full resolution:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803044513im_/http:/typophile.com/files/geogrotesquecenter_4926.png)\n\n"
