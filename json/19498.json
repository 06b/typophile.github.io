I ask this because I used Fontseek and Google on that name and ’Big Anne’ with no result.\n\nI also made the assumption that maybe that’s NOT the name, and looked among similar fonts in the Script Font ID Guide — no matches.\n\nIt’s possible that this is a ’personal font’, since this type of font can be easily made by anyone who can print. In that case, your only chance is to contact the place where you saw this and ask them about how to get the font.\n\nIf that fails, then look for something similar, because there are too many hand-printed fonts to search them all.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
