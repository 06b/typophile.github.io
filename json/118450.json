We take away all the technical hassle for foundries and make the service really easy for web designers to use.\n\nIn effect designers rent fonts from Fontdeck. We host the font files on our own servers and web designers link to those files in order to display the fonts on their website.\n\nFontdeck is a curated marketplace, bringing high quality fonts to the widest possible audience. We’ve created a level playing field, where independent typeface designers could compete easily with large foundries, and set prices themselves.\n\n"
