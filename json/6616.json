  "content": "I wonder if someone might be able to give a bit of subjective advice.   \n   \nI need to get hold of an everyday workhorse range of fonts that support the slightly unusual accented vowels in Welsh (w and y) for MacOS X 10.3. Ideally not costing hundreds of pounds per family, as its just for my personal Welsh coursework.   \n   \nI've Googled it, but the quality of what I've found so far tends to be a little bit... suspect. At least, I'd not want to start forking out cash without some sort of assurance of the quality of the typefaces from unknown vendors.   \n   \nThe ideal would be something along the lines of Perpetua, or a Garamond.   \n   \nDoes anyone have any ideas, or indeed any general advice on using those pesky characters under MacOS? ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015064102im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n",

Sylfaen is a Welsh word meaning \"foundation\"; an apt name since the font stemmed from research into the typographic requirements of many different scripts and languages.   \n   \nThis version of Sylfaen supports the WGL4.0 character set, for Pan-European language coverage. In addition to Latin, Greek and Cyrillic letterforms, the font contains the characters necessary for support of the Armenian and Georgian languages.   \n   \nand thet's the description in the font.\n\n"

      "content": "The only limitation of Sylfaen is that it exists only in a single weight and style: no italic, no bold, etc. This is because it was originally made for a research project, and not intended to be shipped.   \n   \nThe Welsh diacritic characters you need are available in all the Windows core fonts, including Times New Roman, Arial, etc. and also Palatino Linotype, Georgia, Verdana, etc.\n\n"

Minion Pro and warnock Pro are among those which do (also Myriad Pro and Sava Pro, which are not likely to be of interest for this purpose).   \n   \nAdditionally, a number of the typefaces we expect to release in the next 6-8 months will also have such support.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
