  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve always been fond of anything Japanese & I’m now studying the Hiragana & Katana characters. Mind you, I’m not actually studying Japanese, I’m merely looking at the forms & trying to figure out in what length they can be stylized.  \nI’ve been googling myself silly to find Japanese display fonts, but I’m not really getting the results I’m looking for.  \nThings I’m looking for include mostly digital (pixel based) display fonts used for cell phones and such (see attached image), but also any kind of Japanese letterlogo. I think by looking at pixel based Hiragana & Katana characters, I’ll get a better insight into how much of it is “expandable” & what the real characteristics of each character are. Logo’s would obviously also be helpful at this point.  \nAny links would be much appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Katakana.GIF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612185944/http:/typophile.com/files/Katakana_0.GIF) | 10.1 KB |\n\n [‹ Centaur sub](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612185944/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34332 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font to match Perla alternate and other fonts for two collections or not? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612185944/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34217 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The HTML tip will be very useful, I’m always scared at clicking things I don’t know where they lead to.  \nThanks!\n\n"
