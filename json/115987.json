Invitation has bowed strokes on the same letters and usual serifs on them, but these are in the form of a reverse wedge rather than a tilde.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044055im_/http:/typophile.com/files/InvitationCharmapSM_6291.jpg)\n  \nOne influenced the design of the other, but I don't know the direction of the causation.  \nDon \n"

Morris Company.\n\nI have samples of almost the entire alphabet. I'm missing upper case Q X and Z, and lower case j q and z.\n\nThanks so much for your help!\n\n- Bob\n\n"
