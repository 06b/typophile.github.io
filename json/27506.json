Been lurking for a long while now but am now taking the plunge.\n\nIt's rare that sport and typography come together but these new Australian soccer jerseys have been a talking point amongst even typographic novices. What is the face used in the names and numbers? Weirdly, there are many dying to know.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n[http://www.ccmariners.com.au/\\_content/image/00003902-image.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121109100445/http:/www.ccmariners.com.au/_content/image/00003902-image.jpg \"http://www.ccmariners.com.au/\\_content/image/00003902-image.jpg\")\n\n[http://www.geocities.com/sydneyfc06/brosque2b.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121109100445/http:/www.geocities.com/sydneyfc06/brosque2b.jpg \"http://www.geocities.com/sydneyfc06/brosque2b.jpg\")\n\n",

Almost all big sportsbrands now have their custom designed typefaces to keep the merchandising money in the pocket.\n\nSo, as a start, have a look at [this website](http://web.archive.org/web/20121109100445/http:/www.metro-sport.com/) for example, to see how many leagues are playing with licenced typefaces.\n\n"
