But as the WEFT release notes reveal, Mac IE's support for the format is flaky to say the least (non existent in recent versions). Anyhow the guys to talk to are em2-solutions in Sweden. They've implemented their own code for creating EOT's - essentially to sell a serve-side EOT creation solution for use on non-Windows based servers.   \n   \nBest of luck!\n\n"
