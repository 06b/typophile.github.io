I'm pretty sure it's an old Letraset or Mecanorma face, but unfortunately I don't have my catalogues in front of me for reference. I know I'm going to kick myself for not knowing this one off the top of my head.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141100im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18954.gif)   \n   \nThanks all.\n\n",
