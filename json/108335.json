Date and source of image would help.  \nFor a digital font that can produce monograms with a similar formal swirl effect I suggest Antoinette Monogrammes:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/antoinette-monogrammes/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140124061135/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/antoinette-monogrammes/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/antoinette-monogrammes/\")  \nIf you can do a little additional work to make monograms here are some vertical swirl scripts that could produce a nice result:  \nSweet Upright Script:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/upright-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140124061135/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/upright-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/upright-script/\")  \nValentine:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/valentine/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140124061135/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/valentine/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/valentine/\")  \nStradivarius:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/stradivarius/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140124061135/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/stradivarius/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/stradivarius/\")\n\nDon\n\n"

I thought that last letter was a 'C', but it's not - it's an 'L'. Read the PDF manual and then use the Testdrive.\n\nI can't imagine having made such a set of 6 fonts as all combinations of letters must work well together and each font contains characters for three different styles of frame.\n\n"
