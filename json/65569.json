  "content": "Hey all,\n\nMy company is planning to do a reprint of sorts of a historical text that was originally printed in 1833 in Missouri. We'll re-typeset it, and we'd like to match the original typeface as closely as possible.\n\nSo, question #1: Can anyone recommend some good digital typefaces that look like 19th-century serif book fonts? Thus far, the closest I've come is some form of Century, and I'm not wild about it.\n\nQuestion #2: A (non-designer) colleague of mine has a contact who has been talking to him about our predicament. The contact has suggested that we send him scans of the original, which he will send to some third party company who will then create an \"exact match\" typeface from the digital scans. I'm a little wary of this approach (not least because the characters aren't always crystal clear in the original). Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? Can you provide recommendations?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

I bet good proposals of existing fonts would come from that which would be more usable as fonts than some scanned solution.\n\n"

This is good, for why bother to set out to make a font with flaws... but that means it doesn't closely resemble the typefaces of the bad old days.\n\nSo it might be that Hercules or Benton Modern Display are more like what he is looking for...\n\nIt's also possible that Scotch Modern or Scotch Modern Display, from ShinnType, would work; but Scotch Micro, like Miller, avoids the flaws of the old Scotch Romans. It's possible that the other versions do as well, and I'm not interpreting the appearance of the large specimens properly; the text specimen here\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310001732/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\")\n\nin the sample text starting with \"Recontextualizing\" shows a beautiful, legible, and well-proportioned type - a good Scotch Roman instead of a bad one.\n\n"

      "content": "_Miller, although it has unbracketed serifs..._\n\nIt doesn't. It has subtly bracketed serifs, which is one of the features that makes it easier on the eye than more extreme Romantic and Victorian types.\n\nA common feature of many Victorian types is the tightly curled c and e, in which the bottom stroke curves upwards almost to touch the part of the letter above. Miller does not do this, and nor does the scan of the page provided by ‘plenipotentiary’. In fact, if you compare the proportions and treatment of letters in that sample with Miller, you will see that they are quite close; much more so than with Scotch Modern, which follows the tightly curled model.\n\nHere is a comparison, showing what I mean. From top to bottom: the scanned book, Miller Roman, Scotch Modern:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310001732im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cometh_5064.gif)\n\nOf course, Miller isn't a perfect match. Apart from inconsistent details such as the top of the t, Miller's heavier weight gives a different overall impression.\n\n"
