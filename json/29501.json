It has two differing constructions for ’a’ for a start, and two differing widths for the last two words.\n\nYou could start with something like [Clearface](http://web.archive.org/web/20080312104828/http:/www.linotype.com/616/itcclearface-family.html) and mess about with it yourself. Another one that reflects the style of the period is [Windsor.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080312104828/http:/www.linotype.com/90458/windsor-family.html)\n\nAnd you could probably find something at [http://www.letterheadfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080312104828/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/ \"http://www.letterheadfonts.com\") that comes closer to this than either of them, but I don’t know what it would be called.\n\n"

[Quaint Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080312104828/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/quaint-gothic-sg/) share a few traits with your sample.
