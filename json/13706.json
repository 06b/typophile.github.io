There he became an apprentice to [Johann Gutenberg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Johann%20Gutenberg).\n\nAfter a nasty civil war in [1462](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1462), most of Mainz's printers left the city. Many of them travelled to [Italy](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Italy), including Jenson—who ended up in [Venice](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Venice) before [1470](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1470). There, he cast his famous type, which might be the first non- [blackletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/blackletter) type ever cast in the west.\n\nJenson died in [Rome](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Rome) in [1480](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1480).\n\nMost typefaces that are named after Jenson bear little or no relation to his work. However, [Bruce Rogers](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bruce%20Rogers)' [Centaur](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Centaur) comes very close to capturing its spirit.\n\n",
