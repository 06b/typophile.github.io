I can’t recall what he told me about this piece. In any case, I am looking forward to his presentation at ATypI. I spoke with him last week and he is very eager to discuss his work on The Guardian. I wanted to hear more but he had to dash off to an Aston-Villa match.\n\nUnger? No way. Though Good Gerard certainly would have an entertaining story or two to tell.\n\nSincerely,  \nRandolph T. Burke\n\n"

I just spoke with Barnes about this matter and he confirmed his hand in this matter. I tried to cajole him into posting in this forum, but he is too excited about his ATypI presentation. He said that he had done it for an art magazine and was not aware of Unger’s work until afterwards. He said he made a serif version then cut the serifs off.\n\nSincerely,  \nRandolph T. Burke\n\n"
