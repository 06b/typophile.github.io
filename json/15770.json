Although it also depends on the paper.\n\nIt's a delicate face, any way you slice it. There is no bold. But I must say that at sizes of 11-13 pt. it's less ornate and easier to read than, say, Renard or Trinite (which are both awesomely beautiful in their own right.)\n\n"

For my eyes the text weight is still something that sparkles too much for long texts. However, that said, I would use it for brochure or catalog use. I guess I'm contradicting myself. For sub-titles and bylines you could use the text. This is, IMHO, another typeface that is so gorgeous and so rich that too much of it will cause indigestion. However, the right amount of it adds texture and flavor.\n\n"
