I looked through \"Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces\" (Wallis) looking for slab or near slab faces with an E with almost equal arms. I spent some time looking at [Demos](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141411/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/demos/medium/testdrive.html?s=KRISTALL-APOTHEKE&p=48), [Swift](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141411/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/swift/ef-regular/testdrive.html?s=KRISTALL-APOTHEKE&p=48) and [ITC Weidemann](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141411/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-weidemann/medium/testdrive.html?s=KRISTALL-APOTHEKE&p=48). I can see real mismatches with the last two now, but Demos is possibly a fair substitute.   \n   \nYou didn't say what the age or source of the sample was, and if it's from an old piece of printed media, that would possibly rule out many fonts we would look at. It could even be a typeface that hasn't been digitized. If it is a font, there is always the potential for Tiffany's 'squooshing' to have been used.   \n   \nGeneral plea for ID requesters: Please tell us something about the source of the sample, so we can have as much helpful information as possible.\n\n"
