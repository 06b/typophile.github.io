Does anybody believe they won’t avail themselves to the “freebies?”\n\nSo often I see on the font sites the statement “I’m just a collector.” The next day the same person is looking for another font for a “JOB.”\n\nMichael\n\n"

I’d much rather see all the big record labels go chapter 7 and just stream the back-catalog from Corbis for a fee than have the government levy a piracy tax on me. It’s pathetic that no matter how bad it gets these companies will try crazy ideas like this but can’t be persuaded to just stop screwing over musicians and consumers alike.\n\n"
