Because my first font [is now on the market](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016235428/http:/www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Newt%20Serif&producttype=TYP%2CIMG%2CILL) with Veer!\n\nI developed Newt Serif with the help of the Typophile Critique forum ( [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016235428/http:/www.typophile.com/salamander)). After a long time, it's finally come to fruition. The character set includes Basic Latin, Latin-1, and Latin Extended-A codepages, along with a few other characters here and there. There are four weights -- Light, Regular, Demi, and Bold, each with an italic. Thanks for the help, everyone! I hope you like it.\n\n",
