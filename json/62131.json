  "content": " **CosmeticBit** is a pixel font I’m working on for the last 3 years (yeah! pretty slow). What make it different (or try to), from other pixel fonts is make it have OpenType features, such as subscripts, superscripts, ligatures and, at least, have all European alphabet characters.

It looks nice, but there’s not much to add to this genre (though the language support might be very useful to someone!). I’d rather go down the road of subpixel rendering and optical sizes for screen use –&nbsp;which really is some sort of hinting when I come to think of it.\n\n"
