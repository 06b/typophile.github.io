      "content": "Well, first of all, the lettering of ’Scharlachberg’ has a very clear similar font in a revival of [Teutonia](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122105653/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/teutonia/) by Tom Wallace — and it’s on sale right now for a ridiculously low price of $7!\n\nI would bet that at least ’Scharlachberg’ and ’MEISTERBRAND’ are hand lettered. I found an image of a poster using the same marks dating from 1965, so it is at least that old.\n\n"

      "content": "DEUTSCHER WEINBRAND doesn’t look quite like any type I can name. The A top serif is not very common, the serifs are generally rather long, and the letters appear wider than most text typefaces. The slightly squared look of the letters, and that W remind me of some of Hermann Zapf’s typefaces, and I think [Melior](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122105653/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/melior/) is closest, but it does not have this A.\n\nAnother typeface that it reminded me of is [Antikva Margaret](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122105653/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_a/antikva_margaret_full.gif), but this is only in general feel. The details are not close at all. (Sample from the Serif Font ID Guide)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
