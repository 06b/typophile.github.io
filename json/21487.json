Not only because it has a very attractive user interface, but  \nmainly because it supports all font formats, is fully Unicode aware and  \nextremely fast.\n\nDownload it here: [http://www.high-logic.com/download.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20101108142637/http:/www.high-logic.com/download.html \"http://www.high-logic.com/download.html\")\n\nBuy it for only $40 here: [http://www.high-logic.com/register.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20101108142637/http:/www.high-logic.com/register.html \"http://www.high-logic.com/register.html\")\n\nCheck out some Screenshots here:  \n [http://forum.high-logic.com/viewtopic.php?t=1494](http://web.archive.org/web/20101108142637/http:/forum.high-logic.com/viewtopic.php?t=1494 \"http://forum.high-logic.com/viewtopic.php?t=1494\")\n\nMainType 2.0 contains several new features and enhancements. The font export  \nfeature, that is used to export font collections to the web, now includes  \ngreater customization options. With this release, MainType reveals even more  \nimportant typographic data, like Unicode ranges, internal font tables, and  \nthe number of kerning pairs. It also contains a new Browse Favorites feature  \nthat makes it easier to browse through several font collections.\n\nBecause this new version is free for all existing customers of MainType, we  \nencourage all users to download and install this new version over the  \nexisting installation.\n\nDownload it here: [http://www.high-logic.com/download.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20101108142637/http:/www.high-logic.com/download.html \"http://www.high-logic.com/download.html\")\n\nBuy it for only $40 here: [http://www.high-logic.com/register.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20101108142637/http:/www.high-logic.com/register.html \"http://www.high-logic.com/register.html\")\n\nThanks,\n\nErwin Denissen\n\nHigh-Logic Typography Software  \n [http://www.high-logic.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20101108142637/http:/www.high-logic.com/ \"http://www.high-logic.com/\")\n\n",

Is this seriously a non-issue for other Windows users? Does it not make anyone else nuts that all of the current font management tools do essentially the same thing _except_ auto-activation?\n\nI can organize my fonts without a management tool, I can explore all of the glyphs in the InD palette, does anyone really print specimens? (proofs of a mock-up show you how the type holds up in action, not a specimen), and I can fairly easily activate any group of fonts simply by tossing them into the Windows fonts folder, but the one thing I can't do is have my fonts auto-activate when I open a project in InD.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I use and have used Suitcase 9 for a couple of years, and am quite happy with it, but I'm beginning to chew off my fingers waiting for an Extensis upgrade or Linotype to crank out their rumoured FX for Windows that will bring my sleeping fonts to life when I need them.\n\n"
