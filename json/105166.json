      "content": "What I like about this is that through this work it has become rather easy to see how all these accents work in ‘real life’. On the other hand, I also found some things that are somewhat questionable (in my opinion, being Dutch).\n\n**Dutch language**  \n_jè_  \nI am afraid that I’ve never seen that word. Google tells me that it may occur in ‘jè t’aime’, but that is a typo of ‘je t’aime’. Which may occur in Dutch texts, but ‘je t’aime’ is not Dutch, it is French for saying ‘I love you’.\n\n_chambéryzomer_  \nThat seems to be a typo. Could be Chambery zomer (‘Chambéry summer’, could be an offering of a travelling agent, alternatively to ‘Chambéry spring’. But that does not turn Chambéry into a Dutch word. Chambéry is a place in France.\n\n_eénvandaag_  \nSimilar to chambéryzomer. Could be ‘één vandaag’ (one for today). But that does not make it a sample for the occurrence of eén in Dutch. I have seen éen in Dutch but never eén.\n\n_matthäus_  \nAs far as I know, Matthäus is not an official Dutch word, it is the German way of writing Mattheus (the evangelist). Shure one can find ‘Matthäus’ in a Dutch text, but that alone does not make it a Dutch word.\n\n_köppen_  \nMy Dutch dictionary does not list that word and I would not know what ‘köppen’ might mean. Köppen might occur in Dutch text as the name of the German author who wrote several books on color models. But in such a case Köppen is written with a capital K.\n\n_luïciüs_  \nGoogle tells me that this is probably derived from the family name ‘van Stipriaan Luïciüs’. I only found 9 entries with that name, they refer to two people, a father and his son who lived around 1900. How Dutch is that? Or more serious: Is that really relevant to the Dutch language?\n\n_sébastien_  \nNot a Dutch word, but a French name: ‘Sébastien’. The Dutch would write ‘Sebastiaan’.\n\nAnyway, I could not find mistakes like this in the German section, so maybe the quality of the Dutch section is just an exception. Still I hope that Ondrej will find some time to check and correct it.\n\n"

Maybe Ondrej examined case-folded data, as evidenced by your other examples.\n\nNevertheless, very good work and a welcome reference!\n\n"

      "content": "> The capitalized version of één ('only one', emphatically) is Eén\n\nThis is a bit of a different matter but I need some verification. What do you think of Één? In lowercase it's supposed to be één and yet with a capital letter I mostly see Eén. I always assumed that's a mistake considering it's a bit less obvious for some how to add an accent to the capital letter, and as far as I can reason now this and 'überhaubt' are the only cases in the Dutch language where a capital letter might get a diacritic — unless the whole word is capitalized of course.\n\nI think Eén looks better, but it's logically inconsistent.\n\n"
