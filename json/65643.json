The Armenian logo followed suit - or rather, led from behind.\n\nThe letterforms are based on the TMF Nour typeface.\n\nNote: The spelling of the Armenian logo follows the reform orthography. The Mesropian spelling is \"Լոյս\".\n\n--\n\nAlthough the new logo is already in use, I would value any feedback no less.\n\nAlso, on Flickr:  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4210138954/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131145636/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4210138954/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4210138954/\")\n\nhhp\n\n",

I like this a lot.\n\nWhy is the Armenian version at [http://www.luys.am](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131145636/http:/www.luys.am/ \"http://www.luys.am\") different (no serif on the \"ւ\")?\n\nThere's something about the \"s\" that's bugging me, but I can't quite put my finger on it. It seems a bit mechanic perhaps in terms of contrast / linking of the outlines. The arch-based letters seem more refined to my eye. Curious, what made you diverge so far from the original Nour/Harrier \"s\"?\n\n"

It also seems overmechanically executed (see esp. the terminal of the L). But maybe I'm totally misreading the intention of how this is to be read.  \nThat L-shaped letter in the middle of the Armenian logo might need some beefing up on its lower serif (unless downplaying it was intentional).\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for all feedback so far!  \nIt's been as interesting to contemplate as it has been useful.\n\nI guess nativity cuts both ways. I know how to make a logo Armenian-looking, but by the same token it's hard for me to tell if I've gone so far as to give it negative attributes. An Armenian looking at it will probably be pleased (and that's been the case quite strongly so far) but this logo -like most any logo- isn't intended to be viewed only by a specific ethno-cultural group! Although the foundation's fund-raising is probably focused on Armenian sources, it's not good for the logo itself to be _that_ focused.\n\nThe \"chopped\" terminals with the horizontal shears for example are a classic Armenian motif. In fact -as Nina alludes to- the logo's source font (Harrier) has a traditional Latin structure in the \"y\" and \"s\". Changing the \"y\" was pretty easy to justify\\*; the \"s\" however was more of a stretch, and it's very possible I've gone too far with it. But the traditional \"s\" structure _did_ clash pretty strongly with the rest in my view...\n\n\\* Latin uses that structure sometimes, and it  \nmade sense to echo the \"յ\" from the Armenian logo.\n\nSimilarly the \"underline\" aspect of the \"L\" is also an Armenian motif. I have to agree though that it might seem old-fashioned. As for \"dynamism\", I'm hoping the slant does some of that (although otherwise I do admit it's pretty rigid).\n\n\\> Why is the Armenian version at [http://www.luys.am](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131145636/http:/www.luys.am/ \"http://www.luys.am\") different\n\nI'm working on that...  \nIt seems they wanted to make the two logos comparable in width (as you guess) so they figured to \"just\" chop the terminal of the \"ւ\"... So Craig, the beefier it was, the more chance it would get cut I guess. :-/\n\n\\> The curves look too overshot to my eye\n\nConsidering the sourse is a text font, that's entirely possible. It does depend on how large they'll be setting this thing though. Ideally I need to make multiple versions for different sizes (as Jos suggested).\n\nhhp\n\n"
