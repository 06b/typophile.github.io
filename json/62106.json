Windsor is the typeface used in the titles of many Woody Allen films. A modern interpretation of this rusty pearl is something that is something that has always been missing in the major type libraries. But Heroine is not only an interpretation, it goes beyond that. With the addition of swashes and alternate letters in several styles it becomes very addictive.\n\nIt’s like a breeze of Art Noveau with modern bezier skills, old and new celebrated in a typeface family with 9 styles. The weights are handpicked with small steps between them to bring out the best of Heroine. True to history, condensed versions are also included in the family.\n\nSwashes, small caps\\*, extended language support, ligatures and OpenType features are included.  \n[\\* Small Caps not incl. in Heroine Pro - Black]\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHeroine Pro can be found at:  \n [http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/heroine](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023513/http:/www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/heroine \"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/heroine\")\n\nDownload PDF:  \n [http://www.fountaintype.com/specimens/66/original/FTN\\_Heroine.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023513/http:/www.fountaintype.com/specimens/66/original/FTN_Heroine.pdf \"http://www.fountaintype.com/specimens/66/original/FTN\\_Heroine.pdf\")\n\nVideo for Heroine can be found at:  \n [http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/heroine/about](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023513/http:/www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/heroine/about \"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/heroine/about\")  \nor  \n [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Ml2n\\_jfSk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023513/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Ml2n_jfSk \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Ml2n\\_jfSk\")\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nThank you for your time  \nand have a wonderful day\n\nPeter Bruhn  \n[Fountain]\n\n",
