The closest i came to was this link: [http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20120718024751/http:/www.qbf.de/dceng.htm \"http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm\") , which claims it has the font for sale but doesn't register the font in my shopping cart. Do you know how/where I could acquire this font? I'm desperate! thanks so much for your help,  \ndanny\n\n"
