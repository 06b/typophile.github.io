  "content": "Does anyone use Tahoma, particularly for html text?\n\nI know it's a slender cousin of Verdana. What I don't know is why it does not have italics, or at least obliques. I almost prefer its tighter spacing and a narrower footprint than Verdana, although it may be too tight for on-screen use. Not sure if it translates well in the PC version either -- is it fully hinted?\n\nI was hoping anyone (sii?) could explain why Microsoft and/or Mr. Carter appear to have left it unfinished.\n\n",

      "content": "Tahoma was created as a user interface font.\n\nIt was designed with button text, icon labels and small passages of text in mind (error messages and dialogs) and targeted a small range of type sizes rendered bi-level (not for antialiased rendering or the not-yet invented ClearType). It was hinted to the same level as Verdana. The character set is much larger than Verdana and includes Hebrew, Thai, Arabic, extended Latin and extended Cyrillic\n\nWhen we first saw it being used for continuous text on web pages we did cringe but it's use is so prevalent now that I guess everyone has got used to it. Also I think the regular renders pretty well under ClearType (not true for the bold) which helps.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"

      "content": "Tahoma was first made and was suppose to be used to replace MS Sans in the UI of Windows but wasn't used because of the need to exactly match all the widths of the existing UI font. Then it was decided to use a more expanded font. So Matthew made one a bit more normally spaced and it was made for the Web and not the UI.\n\nI made the embedded bitmaps for Tahoma and then instructed Tom Rickner a bit what to do to match the widths and shape of the embedded bitmaps.\n\nThen after that I was told to make another web font so I made Trebuchet. And I was very conscience not to copy the shapes Matthew made (or such as the ascender height (added one pixel) lowercase 'l' (added the hook) the UK 'M' had to add the flares since his was straight and a different LC 'e' and 'g' and basically made different bitmaps at a very low resolution at 9..13 pixels per EM the target screen resolutions.\n\nSo they are all about the same and I had a hand in the developement and hinting of Tahoma, Verdana and Trebuchet but really only get credit for Trebuchet... Oh well got paid in the end anyway.\n\n"
