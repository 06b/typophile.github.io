  "content": "So I was looking at my TV screen the other day and what my Playstation was showing there and noticed how really nice [its menu font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131102419/http:/typophile.com/files/ps3-menu-font_4772.jpg) was. After a bit of tracking and [with help of akira1975](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131102419/http:/typophile.com/node/64596) the font happened to be [Rodin](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131102419/http:/www.fontworks.co.jp/typography/family/rodin) by the Japanese foundry, Fontworks.\n\nIt is really pricey, over $200 for a single weight. Plus shipping and handling as the CD is the only delivery method. Plus it quite understandably includes hieroglyphics, which I do not see using in any foreseeable future.\n\nAll this doesn't make its Roman letters any less nicer. So I had this rather dumb thought to try and create my version of Rodin.\n\nI fully realize how utterly unqualified I am for the task, and how monumental the task itself is, but (a) I am really curious to give it a try (b) one can't learn without trying (c) I am in no rush and have no other incentive except for the curiosity.\n\nThe question I have though is this. How \"OK\" is it to try and replicate an existing type ? Not pixel by pixel or curve by curve, of course, but more of having an ultimate goal of creating a similarly looking type.\n\nI am asking because on one hand there is Swiss 721/Pragmatica/etc siblings of Helvetica, and Rodin itself seems to be borrowing extensively from Akzidenz-Grotesk, but on the other hand there is [Great MyFonts Purge](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131102419/http:/typophile.com/node/56010) thread.\n\nMy apologies for the \"noob\" question, but I would really appreciate any insight where does the line go between copied/cloned and inspired/derived types.\n\n---\n\nPS. Typophile.com guys, are you reading the feedback emails ? I tried using it to ask about changing the account name several days ago, but never heard anything back.\n\n",

(original as noun/substantive)\n\nEnglish is not my mother-tongue, but to judge from English dictionary definitions, \"original\" as noun and as adjective are semantically different in English. For instance, Webster's Collegiate, eleventh editition, defines:\n\noriginal, adjective = \"being the first instance from which a copy is made\"\n\noriginal, noun = \"that from which a copy is made\" (there is no mention of first instance in this definition)\n\nSo, the noun does not necessarily denote the first instance. Therefore, if someone makes a copy from \"Neue Helvetica\", \"Neue Helvetica\" would be \"the original\" (noun), although \"Neue Helvetica\" is not the first instance of Helvetica and hence not \"the original (adjective) Helvetica\".\n\n"
