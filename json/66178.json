  "content": "It strikes me there's a lot of good will on this forum, both from users and the Typophile volunteers. It occurred to me that there could be additional ways of generating contributions for the upkeep of the site.\n\nOne idea that just jumped unbidden into my mind was that we could make a CD or download-pack showcasing some of the talent we have here and bringing together the best resources. A compilation of type specimens, fonts (beta versions or otherwise not commercially ready) and the public domain articles/resources most useful for people in this community. There are probably lots of other things that could be included, but I'm at work and unable to spend time thinking about it for the moment. There could even be opportunities for advertising, why not. Events calendar?\n\nThe idea would be for members to submit their ideas, then there would be some selection process and then the resulting pack could be purchased online for download.\n\nThere are a few fonts I'm working on which will never get to the stage of commercial release but which I'd consider submitting when a bit more finished. Would anyone else consider submitting pre-release things like this? Could be good publicity. I'd also be able to dedicate time to a project like this if it went ahead.\n\nAnyway, it's maybe a fun thing to do so I thought I'd see what everybody thinks. Sometimes ideas are not to be trusted though, so if this sounds rubbish please post your thoughts.\n\nBetter get back to creating training materials templates now...\n\n",

I'll put on my thinking hat and develop the idea a little. Of course if anyone has any brainwaves, dump them here and we can review in a while.\n\nThe trouble with printing would be the expense I think. Online publishing would have much lower costs, but you're right there is something just better about physical objects. I love it when stuff I've designed comes in a delivery! Opening the boxes is always a daunting and exciting moment!\n\n"
