It says that for the El Paso Times Serifa is to be used for all section flags and for story labels.\n\nWhat is a section flag and story label in a newspaper?\n\n [‹ Type Designers Boycotting OS X!?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201170249/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38292 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Indiana Jones and the Kerning of Doom ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201170249/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39937 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Using the El Paso Times as a guide, one example of the section flag is the “El Paso Times” on the front of the paper. Interior sections might be called “Sports,” “Features” or “Local.” The large type on those pages denoting the sections would also be section flags.\n\nStory labels probably vary from paper to paper, but (again) using the El Paso times as an example, they’re likely referring to something like the “SPECIAL POW REPORT” that appears on the front to the left. I’m sure they use labels like this for other special reports or spreads.\n\n- Lindsay (former newpaper editor/designer)\n\n"
