  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have been working on a website project the last 6 months. Now when the release is here, I feel it´s not a day to late to get some input on the typographic and visual aspect of it. I feel that this is the right forum for it.  \nI can write a lot about this site... the name and branding, the concept, the dynamic layout solution, the typographic presentation, flash vs. non-flash etc. But basically it´s about one thing, presenting an overview of relevant news and articles, easy and pleasent.\n\nfeel free to give me some input on the visual aspect of this. Especially on the typography.\n\n[http://secondsof.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211557/http:/secondsof.com/ \"http://secondsof.com/\")\n\nThank you.  \nPatrik\n\n(One issue that I am aware of and working on is the file-size/loading... this is not becasue of the flash files ;) but of the RSS/atom- feeds size.)\n\n",
