  "content": "Lasta is small serif font family with simple elegant shapes, refreshing Italics and poetic endings. Containing 2 weights and 2 italics, with lower x-height which brings more air (empty space, white space...) into paragraphs making text more graceful and legible. Thin serifs bring small touch of dynamic into letter forms, just enough to bring specific tone to paragraph. Beside being mainly imagined as fully text family, Lasta is suitable titles or decorative typography as well for, especially the Italics with fancy curvy endings.\n\n[http://www.tourdefonts.com/font-catalog/lasta/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/www.tourdefonts.com/font-catalog/lasta/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TLasta_Poster_1_4533.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TLasta_Poster_2_4183.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TLasta_Poster_3_5270.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TLasta_Poster_4_5039.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TLasta_Poster_5_5898.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TLasta_Poster_6_4320.jpg)\n\nAvailable from (or it will be soon):\n\n[MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/new.myfonts.com/foundry/Tour_de_Force/)  \n [YouWorkForThem](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/designer/354/tour-de-force-font-foundry/)  \n [FontSpring](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/www.fontspring.com/foundry/tour-de-force)  \n [Fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/searchresults.htm?foundry=Tour+de+Force+Font+Foundry)  \n [FontDeck](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/fontdeck.com/foundry/tourdeforce)  \n [ITC Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/www.itcfonts.com/fonts/searchresults.htm?st=5&cid=Tour+de+Force+Font+Foundry&pg=1)  \n [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/www.linotype.com/808063/tourdeforcefontfoundry-library.html)  \n [Type.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110841/http:/www.type.co.uk/a_to_z_listing/supplier/65)\n\n",
