  "content": "Looking for a headline typeface for a fashion brand (ladies clothing) for adverts, website slides etc.  \nThe brand is edgy and experimental and needs something different to the usual didone and sans serif styles.\n\nI'm thinking something like Rihanna's style:  \n [Rihanna1](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424023551/http:/ghettobabydesigns.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/rihanna-unapologetic.html)  \n [Rihanna2](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424023551/http:/toyaz-world.net/wp-content/uploads/albums/w102/toyablogger28/rihanna-complex07.jpg)\n\nI'd love to get some lettering commissioned but unfortunately can't do that so hoping someone knows of a decent font like this, preferably with a few alternates so it looks more hand done.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas for something like this, or any other ideas for a typeface.  \nHas to be edgy and Audacious!\n\nThanks  \nJoe\n\n",

Definitely has the right personality  \nIt is formal and will require a lot of breathing space (I think) to work but I'll definitely try it out.\n\nThanks  \nJoe\n\n"
