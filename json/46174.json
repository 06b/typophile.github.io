  "content": "hi!  \nThe use of hand-rendered type has risen dramatically over the past few years.  \nAlthough many dismiss it as trendy and unprofessional, the hand lettering does have its own unique character.  \nBe it the rough edges, uneven width of the strokes or even a slight variety of x-height between characters, but there is something about it that I personally find very appealing.\n\nI am looking to examine some fonts that have been inspired by the hand lettering and was hoping you could provide me with some links and also express your views on the subject. I am not looking for script fonts, or fonts inspired by peoples hand-writing, but rather fonts inspired by signage etc.\n\nyour input is appreciated as always!\n\n [‹ PC MAC PDP-1](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905212945/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46055 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Visiting Venice Italy - what should I see? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905212945/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46270 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Case in point: the credits for the movie Juno, where they accompanied painfully over-the-top dialogue by teenagers in thrift-store retro outfits and a girl-with-a-guitar soundtrack. Case in point number two: Flight of the Conchords, the comedians who expertly mocks the straight-out-of-Williamsburg motifs that infest Juno, use this style of lettering to make it very clear who they’re mocking. When the comedians catch a trend as quickly as it comes on the scene, that’s a sign the trend is in for a short lifespan.\n\nWhat I’m interested in is what will follow: a reactionary swing to crisp modernism or techno 1990s retro? Or will the designers move on to hand-lettered work with a more finished look, like sho-cards or painted Russian propaganda posters?\n\n"
