  "content": "Just to throw this question out there. At several levels:\n\n1. Logos/Wordmarks  \nMaybe I'm wrong but I'd say quite a few people would start off a logo/wordmark with an exisiting typeface and modify it. Any IP/copyright issues with this?\n\n2. Typeface creation  \nWhats the position on creating a new typeface off an existing typeface. I'm sure designers/typographers have been known to start off using a basic set to get things moving quickly. I assume there are infringements in this realm. or am I wrong.\n\nAre there typefaces that allow you to modify them without any issues?\n\nObviously the ideal if you were a 'pure' type designer is to design from scratch. However at the end, how does anybody know whether a typeface is a modification of an existing one (unless its blatantly obvious and hasn't been modified much) or one from scratch - unless you keep and show original hand sketches..\n\nWould like to hear your opinions\n\n",

      "content": "It’s all in the EULA. Sorry if this an unsatisfying answer, but the restrictions for the use/adaptation of a typeface differ from foundry to foundry and from country to country.\n\nGenerally the use of a typeface in a logotype is unrestricted (but a notable exeption is House Industries, who want an extra licensing fee for the commercial use of their fonts — other foundries may have their own restrictions).\n\nCreating a new typeface of an existing one? In the US it is kinda allowed if you do NOT use the code, but instead start with a print and work from there. In Europe it depends upon the degree of similarity. The end product must be a new creation.\n\nAll this is in general terms. Be sure to read the EULA’s...\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"
