Conventional typefaces like Times, Minion, Garamond, Charter, Georgia, Dante, Clifford, Hoefler Text, Constantia, Galliard, Electra, Goudy Oldstyle, etc. are all adequate for instructions, tests, forms, etc. as long as they aren't mangled (negative tracking, inadequate linespacing, light inking, artificially condensed). There are better ones and of course much worse ones (Helvetica, Bodoni, display typefaces), but is there some critical reason the typefaces have to have some legibility rating? What kind of texts are you preparing?\n\nI ask because there is no such standard test; it's a huge bugaboo in the type and typography world, and unfortunately it's all decided ad hoc. your best bet right now is actually to make a \"safe\" or conventional choice and not mess with the type too much; set it well. If you want assistance in choosing highly legible typefaces, be prepared either for a cacophonous disagreement, or else very subjective choices from whoever you ask.\n\nYou may have to design the test yourself, if this information is required. Contact me offline for suggestions.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick I think you make some great points about the culture of type and business.\n\nDespite that I think it would be great if really useful thorough research was done. It could be useful for Scientists, useful for Users, and useful for font makers. I think all of that & more could definitely be done if there was funds and a will. But I am not holding my breath! I am happy and in a way grateful that there is position at MS for Kevin! Were that there were more!\n\nBut the reality is that doing this research isn't a big priority in our Civ. We are very rich civilization and we could be doing much much much more. But we don't. This is party because we already seem to have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to fonts - and it's snowballing! And partly because the purpose of one font vs. the other is, so much of the time that of sensibility & tone served with the usual portion of utility; rather than sheer utility or with utility coming as a first or dominant priority. And because of that I think that the Nick Shinns of the world need not fear too much. Maybe this is a mistaken impression. Maybe there is more pressure as regards utility than I know. Feel free to correct me.\n\n<cite> The efficacy of a design cannot be determined before it is marketed </cite>\n\nThis seems mistaken to me. You can learn things ahead of release of a font about it's utility. What you can't know is how well a face is going to sell. Which thing are you getting at here?\n\n<cite> Some however may resist such platitudes, etc...</cite>\n\nI agree that being assimilated into \"group thought\" would be a bad plan. But that isn't science. The conflation of Marketing & Science isn't helpful, even if one thing may trail on shortly after the other. Once Kevin's work published is in a peer reviewed scientific journal it is cooperative. And when MS decides that Kevin is allowed publish MS funded research then; to that extent, they are genuinely cooperating and contributing to the common good. The key word being extent.\n\nAlso in fairness to Kevin you can't expect his boss' priorities to be the general welfare of western civ or civ in general much as they might like to spin it that way – and have. If it can't be used for competitive advantage then it might not be worth it for them. They need to justify what they do in service to MS. Maybe there can be a bit of overlap as regards the world but that has to be secondary. By the same token you can't expect Nick to point to a competitor's typeface on Typophile. Obviously sheer scale means that it isn't the same. But I think it's the same kind of thing.\n\nI also think there is also always going to be a cultural/experiential overlay to the results despite even an ideal testing process\\*. Data collected in OH might be different from NYC might be different from Germany & so on. So it may (or may not be) that you can get solid usable results but the practical application is questionable.\n\nI feel am not contradicting myself here. Or shading things grey. I am just attempting to parcel things out.\n\n<cite> For actually coming up with creative... </cite>\n\nI think \"Creative\" isn't for the purposes of this discussion one thing. It is at least two. It is sensibility & tone rather and utility.\\*\\* Obviously you are right when it comes to selecting for sensibility & tone. But utility is a different animal. It is true that if you can know the purpose a font will be put to, LCD screens or Newsprint or whatever you can use your eyes and go with your educated impression. And that works very well. If it didn't we wouldn't see the advances we have. What I reject in the abstract is the idea that Science can't be effectively added to the team as it were. The \"unfair\" advantage is simply that MS can afford the services of a scientist. But compared to dropping fonts into the market for free I suspect this is a minor advantage.\n\n<cite> hyping of such type products with scientific or statistical terminology </cite>\n\nHere I agree. Anybody can come up with a list of the most readable fonts ( or a best font) & then drop a white paper that is supposed to prove it. Okay not anybody. But is done in many industries and constantly. You have to be skeptical. And people are, more & more. But being critical **is** science. What sucks is when they decide that it's a good plan to pitch science along with it's superficial trappings. Don't conflate scientific process & hype. Hype doesn't have to attend Science. And when it does they can be separated. It isn't fun, but it can be done.\n\nAlso from what I can tell people have been less & less inclined to accept hype with re: to fonts. I don't think that the reception given to ClearType has been rapturous. It wasn't as bad as the din about Vista but still...\n\n<cite> I agree that it reduces too much, too simplistically, but it would sometimes be handy to be able to point to something easy for non-specialists to understand. </cite>\n\nScience is complicated and grey much of the time. It is really really rare and wonderful when real science can be presented as something easy to understand. Like \"you need enough vitamin C to avoid Scurvey so get this citrus in your diet\". I don't have much hope that this \"something\" will be produced for use with clients. And I am even less ceratin that they would make good use of it. I am much more hopeful that many small somethings might be available to type designers\\*\\*\\* to make use of. And that we could be more effective at marketing.\n\n<cite>And yet this happens anyway</cite>\n\n\"There is one born every Minute\" comes to mind. This is why Marketing exists. I agree with Carl. I think you have to shrug it off basically. His \"what to do\" is certainly more pithy!\n\n\\* Assuming such a thing could exist which it cannot.  \n\\*\\* Maybe you don't mean to include utility but given the context of your use of it it seemed like you did.  \n\\*\\*\\* Or type making companies\n\nFor those of you that made it this far - sorry about this overly long post.\n\n"

The Reader's Opinion. Determining which existing typefaces are more legible has less to do with scientists vapidly collecting abstract metrics, and more to do with testing typefaces in use: reading speed, comprehension, comfort over long reading times, eye fatigue. It doesn't presuppose dissecting or destroying anything, and it isn't necessarily divorced from what typographers \"know\" about type. The trick is to get typographers involved in designing tests. That's what Kevin is on to. One of the most frustrating flaws in research to date is wretchedly bad typeface selection.

Or maybe I will... depending on what researchers and their employers ( or universities) decide to do.\n\nI have faith that the best ideas for improving type will come from type makers be they indie or otherwise, and with or without research to inspire or gird their results. Maybe in that sense I agree with you. And maybe if people (type makers and scientists alike) notice useful stuff they will share that useful stuff. I plan to. You have.

There is something rather noble sounding in a scientific method for testing type; however, ultimately such a system would only do a disservice to type and to readers. This scene came to me in a dream:\n\nThe year is 2025. My client proposes that we go with WhatevernextSuperLegible Sans because it has a 5-star legibility rating. Cut to me, pan right as I slit my throat with a rusty razor blade. The End.\n\nThe problem I have with the whole science and type thing is that legibility is just one part of the equation. A good typographer (in fact, even an average one) knows whether a text is legible (and whether the typography is an aid to readability). We don't need science to confirm what we already know. Do we?\n\n<cite>I think the proposition is that “the world’s most eminent scientists” would build their tests around.... The Reader’s Opinion.</cite>\n\nBut that doesn't sound like good science. 10,000 subjective opinions does not sum to universal truth; so, either a falsifiable theory of legibility is proposed; or, we simply do as we have done for the past 500 years.\n\nI'm reminded of those TV commercials for shampoo and skin care treatments: \"clinically proven\", \"scientifically tested\", et al. The day a typeface is accompanied by something similar, I'll be reaching for that razor blade.\n\n"

Proposing that affordance is a curve with a distinct shape is more useful than thinking of readability as a simple equation of more versus less. And it is a perspective that has it's source in science.\n\nWhere, in terms of type-size the climb begins or the plateau sits; how wide the plateau is are issues involving thresholds and ranges and vary from type to type. I suspect an analysis of variance will show that, for most standard text fonts the thresholds and ranges don't vary dramatically under normal conditions of use or covary linearly. In other words, a change that affects a threshold positively might have a negative effect on where the plateau sits. Perhaps the styles of termination, or types of contrast can be an example. But thresholds and ranges do nevertheless, I think we'll find, interact with the traditional typographical parameters. And I suspect they do so in demonstrably more complicated ways than we have seen codified so far.\n\nSimple affordance has to be balanced with issues of comfort in large texts, with concerns about heirarchical transparency, surveyability and navigability in instructional manuals, and with the cultural-historical positioning or affiliation statements a document has to make. Comfort in large texts, positioning, and the demands for heirarchical transparency, surveyability and navigability can exert countervailing pressures on the choice of type. This makes a decontextualized descision based soley on simple or generic affordance micro-advantages short-sighted.\n\nMany clients groups are aware of these subtlities in how affordance works and of countervailing pressures. Many others willingly learn. What seems to count is explicit evidence of well-motivated and knowledge-based decision-making.\n\n"

No, it's like a snake...) (Why didn't they just ask the mahout?)\n\nIt might be difficult to design a font that is completely illegible and still include identifiable letters, and it's true, the most legible font in the world can be mangled by bad typography. The fact there is bad typography though, suggests that starting with a highly legible typeface should mitigate the awfulness somewhat. But, what's a legible typeface 'sposed to look like?\n\nThe rules of what make a legible typeface are in my opinion are quite simple and straightforward and allow for a great deal of flexibility. I don't think is is even possible to design a definitively \"most legible\" typeface. I think in any fare test of comparable fonts, you'll find that differences in performance can be so slight as not to matter.\n\nI really don't think legibility standards need to be anything to get knickers in a twist about. It's mostly common sense to anyone with some expertise in typography. I think where that kind of standardization would apply would be on wayfinding signage, medicine bottles, captioning on TV, operating instructions that come with power tools and the TV guide in the newspaper. (OK that last one is personal, but Really! Would it be possible to make it worse?) and things like government and public transit websites and other printed materials, where accessibility is a right that these organization should make honest efforts to honour.\n\nThis sort of graphic work seldom actually gets designed in any real way. The objective in producing a set of instructions may turn out to be \"How many tiny black words can I fit onto this tiny piece of paper that will be packaged with these potentially deadly drugs\" instead of what percentage of people who should read these instructions will not be able to?\". Even if the designer conscientiously designed this sheet to be as readable as possible, he or she would have no way of telling you what percent of people could read it. That should be something that could be determined. At the very least, there should be some set of guidelines that can be referred to, that are a bit more sophisticated than, \"use Arial and make it big\" (the real purpose of such a spec is to keep people who know less than the spec writer from using some crazy Spenserian script, and Arial is a font they can name.)\n\nTaking the example of Erik Spiekermann's work for the Financial times, where he improved the legibility of their typeface by cleaning up the shapes somewhat, increasing tracking and leading and (counter intuitively to most) slightly decreasing the font size.\n\nI think that the form such \"standards\" might take need not be unreasonably restricting at all and would have no impact on what the vast majority of designers do.\n\nHellbox, email me (russ.mcg at gmail.com), and I'll tell some of what I've done to test legibility. It was for signage, but some of it might apply to what you are doing.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

You can make the same arguments, and they will be just as wrong-headed and against the progress of humanity.\n\nFor example, the issue of text size has an obvious and measurable affect on readability. You can make text small enough that people can't read it. And you can measure how small that is, how it varies with age and acuity, and so on. There is no reason to think that less obvious things can't be studied also, with sufficient imagination in theorizing and sufficient cleverness in experimentation.\n\nThat doesn't mean that everything to do with readability, particularly the aesthetic side, is likely to be measured soon or ever. But to just wave aside scientific study is highly misguided.\n\nAs Peter explains, a successful science of readability is likely to come up with theories that are as complex and subtle as we know reading to be. And such insights may well help us to improve reading on screens, to help those with limited vision, with forms of dyslexia, and so on.\n\n"

And might not one type perform better for rag right setting, the other for justified? And how would they fare when one varies the Flesch index? Would Janson's readability index be better for longer words?\n\nAll in all, for an index of typeface readability to be meaningful and useful, a standards manual would have to be published in the form of a type specimen, showing the exact setting which had been tested. For online use, the monitor and operating system would have to be specified, as well as pixel-height and application or file format (hinting varies).\n\nHowever, AFAIK, reading tests in laboratories are not conducted using \"real\" text. For instance, the Moving Window technique restricts the amount of text that is visible to a certain number of letter around a fixation point, and replaces all of the other letters on the page with the letter x.\n\nI don't believe there would be anything particularly scientific about indexing the readability of typefaces. It would be a simple form of market research. Investigating how reading works is one thing, and of course I support it, but applying readability standards to typefaces (the subject of this thread) is something else.\n\n"
