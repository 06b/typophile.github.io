I have to admit that it's a bit of a weak point in my skill set. Anyway, here are a couple ones that maybe you type-identifying virtuosos can readily detect...\n\nthanx in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [fritz-font1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120233/http:/typophile.com/files/fritz-font1.jpg) | 26.17 KB |\n| [fritz-font2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120233/http:/typophile.com/files/fritz-font2.jpg) | 70.63 KB |\n\n",

Actually, for what I'm doing I think that the Helvetica Neue LT Std that I was messing with would have been a close enough match, but the Blair is much more elegant (I really like that typeface) and I was able to find a free version of it (with a bit of looking).\n\nAs for me JPGs. I double checked and they are indeed RGBs. I can't think of why one would display and the other not as they both were generated with the same \"Save for Web and Devices\" function in Photoshop with the exact same settings. Not that I doubt that they weren't working on someone's browser, but I'm curious as to what the reason might be.\n\n"
