It seems like a well intentioned, but pointless inclusion, and well, a little beyond the scope of a type designer's job. could a designer seriously contemplate taking any kind of action against some one who used his or her fonts to express thoughts, he or she disagrees with?\n\n",

Theoretically the licensor can put whatever restrictions they want in the EULA and, if it's written well, can hold the licensee accountable once they've agreed to those terms. Whether or not that is a practical reality is another story.\n\nI once had a conversation with the cartoonist [Chris Ware](http://web.archive.org/web/20100216090727/http:/www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?page=shop.browse&category_id=211&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=62&vmcchk=1&Itemid=62) and I asked if he had ever considered translating any of his wonderful lettering styles in to typefaces. He said he came very close to doing so once, but ultimately decided against it because he didn't want to see his work used for cigarette ads or other things that he didn't agree with. He certainly could have attempted to thwart such usage in the license, but I'm sure he realized, from a practical standpoint, it can be tricky to enforce restrictions beyond a certain point.\n\nI've always been curious if there have ever been any licenses which attempted to restrict how the type was set to ensure it was used as intended – restrictions of size, spacing, capitalization, media, colorization, etc… like a legally instituted style guide.\n\n"

Well, design is not the same as art, but in case of art the artist should have the right to forbid the misuse of his pieces of art, because it is not necessarily recognizable for the public anymore, if the piece of art is shown in a context, that is in contradiction to the intention of the piece of art.\n\nI assume, that, when the idea of EULA for digital products was born, the primary intention was money, but I can say for material pieces of art, sculptures for example, that the artist also can declare a license restriction with regard to the context, in which the piece of art is exhibited. In other words the artist could say: When you “buy” this sculpture, you are allowed to permanently possess it (if I don’t need it for an exhibition), but I remain the owner. In this case the fact, that sculptures (those ones, that are founded [in bronze for example]) are limited to a certain number of pieces, becomes a special meaning.\n\nAs more the typeface is a piece of art, as more such a license restriction can become useful. In case of a body text typeface it would be absurd, because the function “content transporter” dominates the meaning of the typeface (Otherwise it would be not a good body text typeface.).\n\nLol, in case of DTL I think they try to materialize their digital typefaces with the help of the price. The price makes the fonts to unicums.\n\n"

      "content": "The idea of ‘moral’ clauses in EULAs is an interesting one, although it seems to me that what we're really talking about is exclusionary clauses targeting people or groups of people with particular ideas or involved in particular activities, and such clauses may or may not be defined in terms of morality. I might decide that my fonts are not to be used to promote scrapbooking, but not because I consider scrapbooking immoral. People find it easy to dress their prejudices up as morality, but I figure its easiest to simply avoid the moral debate in intellectual property licensing and simply be as bloody-minded as one is willing to be seen to be (and is willing to enforce). Alternatively, just put the stuff out there and if it ends up being used in a way of which you disapprove, use that occasion as an opportunity to speak out.\n\nMy moral code is summarised by the statement ‘Don’t be an arsehole’ -- or as Christ more politely put it, ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you’ --, but I'm not sure how to frame that in terms of a EULA.\n\nJames: _Mostly I just want to keep my fonts away from hate groups and cults like Focus on the Family, LDS, the moonies, and the Knights of Columbus. I specifically wrote that clause because of the bigotry coming out of LDS in recent years. The way I see it, when even the normally warm-and-fuzzy Mormons start acting like shits it’s time for sensible people to start building walls around them._\n\nThis is sad, and also ironic, because if you talk to e.g. many Christians about how they view secular culture, you'll get a similar response: they are frightened and feel that walls need to be built to protect the values that they see under threat. The result is an acutely bitter divide based on mutual fear and distrust, which finds expression in both political and cultural terms. I am reminded of the frequent exhortation of John Paul II, ‘Be not afraid!’ -- not because there is nothing to be frightened of but because he knew, having lived through the Nazi occupation and communist repression in Poland, that people often do terrible things when they feel threatened.\n\nOne of the things that I love most about type and typography -- at least text typography -- is its intrinsic connection with dialogue, with the exchange of ideas. One of the reasons I am less interested in display typography is that it seems more like shouting than conversation. The trouble with building walls, defensive though they may be, is that you end up with either the silence of separate solitudes or people shouting at each other over the ramparts. The opportunities for conversation are greatly diminished and, hence, so are the opportunities for typography to do what it does, i.e. articulate that conversation in written form.\n\nThere are certainly things I hope not to see my typefaces used to promote -- things ranging from tacky and tasteless to moral evil --, but I don't seek to prevent such use.\n\n"
