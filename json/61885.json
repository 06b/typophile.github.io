  "content": "Hi folks\n\nWe're piloting a new sports nutrition range.\n\nThe product is innovative and technical and we're aiming to appeal to serious athletes rather than macho muscle-heads.\n\nSo the image we're after is clean, scientific, upmarket and dynamic/masculine. The brand is quite design led - we're aiming to be the \"Apple\" of our marketplace.\n\nWe're looking for a font that's cutting-edge and distinctive, but legible at relatively small sizes for labelling. To get the dynamic feel, we've mainly been focusing on Italic Slab Serif, but perhaps we're on the wrong track?\n\nWe're really struggling to find anything suitable. We've done a lot of digging around on the mainstream font sites, so we're hoping you guys might know of something we might have overlooked - perhaps something in a small font-house or the public domain?\n\nAny help with this would be much appreciated!\n\n",

This squares with the designer's statement that his inspiration was \"architectural geometry of cast iron and brickwork in nineteenth- century American cityscape\".\n\nDefinitely on the right lines though!\n\nThanks\n\n"
