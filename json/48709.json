But the sticker does not to me seem to be using Gotham and Requiem--and Obama's known for his incredibly consistent brand (just look at his personal jet, styled in Gotham). I can't quite ID them--it doesn't seem like Requiem or Perpetua for the serif, though it may be Trajan, and the sans didn't appear to be Gotham, Gill Sans, or Antique Olive.\n\nAnyone have any ideas/think this bumper sticker is bogus?\n\n",
