We tried both Smart Cells (woodwing) and Table-/Cellstyles pro, but they were both no good.\n\nDoes anyone know a good plugin for handling tables in Indesign? I've been working quite a lot in html, in really miss the simpliccuty from that \"world\".\n\nThanks!\n\nAlex\n\n",

      "content": "Wow. It's interesting to hear that HTML tables are \"simple\" from someone who has a web design background. From my (print-based) perspective, designing tables with InDesign is far more simple than with HTML, even with only the built-in table functions.\\*\n\nCan you show us an example of what the tables should look like? Or what you need the plugin to do?\n\n\\* In fact, if you don't mind if I \"turn the tables\" on you for a bit - I'm looking for a visual tool that will help me build HTML tables!\n\n"

      "content": "Padding, margin, typographic options etc are all available in InDesign's tables, without a plug-in. Nearly anything you can do with a regular text box, you can do with a table cell.\n\nAs for styles, that I don't think is available. You can adjust any cell, row, or column just by selecting it and changing options either in the table palette or dialog box. I assume you have done this, but wish to adjust the same column on multiple tables at once. I see your dilemma.\n\nSomething tells me we could teach each other quite a bit if we were only in the same office for a day. Now, for that ticket to Oslo...\n\n"
