I like its cleanness, legibility/readability, large range and subtle impact. It is somehow a free alternative to Gotham.\n\n"

I have failed to look into these fonts before and found about 140 serif fonts that might need to be added to my Guide. I saw some familiar fonts, and a few that seemed like renames of existing designs (not cool!), but also a lot that seemed original.\n\nHas there been any discussion of the merits/demerits of the Google Fonts?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
