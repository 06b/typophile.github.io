  "content": "Hi, I'm an information design student struggling to find a good typeface or typeface combination for my thesis dissertation, I've tried a bunch but none have convinced me.   \n   \nI was wondering if anyone could help me with the choice(s). Here are the absolutely necesary requirements:   \n   \n- That is prints nice on laser printers   \n- Very complete family sets, as I'll probably be using various levels of hierarchy   \n- Lining and old-style figures, as I'll be using lots of tables to display information   \n- The most important one: that it's extremely readable   \n   \nDesirable qualities:   \n   \n-A large x-height   \n-Economical on space without sacrificing readability   \n-That it looks contemporary, intelligent and rational   \n   \nI'm taking a look at Whitney (H&FJ) right now for headings and tables. Is this a good choice? Any alternatives?   \n   \nI'm also torn between making the body serifs or sans-serifs, any help on the matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

      "content": "For print text, serifs are much more readable in my opinion. For headings and tables a sans is fine. Your 'contemporary, intelligent and rational' brings to mind [Whitman](http://web.archive.org/web/20120326181234/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman). Someone here mentioned a pairing of Whitman and [Bliss](http://web.archive.org/web/20120326181234/http:/www.typography.net/type/bliss.htm), which sounds to me just wonderful.   \n   \nI don't know about a serif pairing for Whitney, but no doubt you can get some suggestions here.\n\n"
