  "content": "Hello,  \nThis is my first post so I just wanted to say that I really enjoy reading you, interesting topics by passioned people (this is not shoes polish at all).  \nI was looking around about blackletters and found this interesting image.  \nIt looks like Old English or Gothique with some kind of a Fraktur emphasis but I believe it's custom work but not sure, so if you have any ideas, thx\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [blackletter.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112181352/http:/typophile.com/files/blackletter.jpg) | 11.88 KB |\n\n",
