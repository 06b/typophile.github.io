      "content": "Having the e be a rotation of the a (or vice versa) is a neat idea that is totally not working here. \"hamburgefons\" is an eyesore as a result. I think, at the very least, the counters need to be larger in order for those letterforms to work. The top of the Q feels sawn off rather than flattened. The figures are ungainly. They either need to be smoothed out or made more geometric; they're lumpy now. I like the g, m, and w. Is the x supposed to be leaning to the right?\n\nRight now it feels more like [Eurostile](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123211313/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Eurostile), [Microgramma](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123211313/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Microgramma), or [Bank Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123211313/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bank%20Gothic) more than a [didone](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123211313/http:/typophile.com/wiki/didone), mostly because the curves of the bowls and lobes undercuts the contrast in the strokes. It also feels a little like [Peignot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123211313/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Peignot), with the unusual variations in heights and letterforms. I think what it really needs is to have a coat of consistency slapped over it, and then see what direction you want to take it. It's not boring, but it has no idea what it wants to be when it grows up.\n\n"
