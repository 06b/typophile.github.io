Im trying to sketch a design to do over it so I need the font, just can’t remember the name - think it started with an ’S’....\n\nWhat, no one has a tattoo font catalog lying around at home?\n\n"

BUT, Ive searched to no avail so Im opting for the photo and scan option and hopefully it’ll be good enough to transfer.\n\nThanks anyway!\n\n"
