I had noticed the guy pulled the site down some time ago, but I thought that he might be coming back...but no, so now this great name is available again !\n\nIt still gets a tonne of legacy traffic (about 5000 Unique Visitors/month), so would be a great domain name for someone here either starting up a new design & typography blog/website focused on hebrew fonts, or somebody who already has one and is looking for some instant, highly targeted traffic (via 301/302 redirection).\n\nCheck it out here:\n\n[http://cgi.ebay.com.au/99Fonts-COM-Design-Domain-Name-COM-2yo-PR3-5k-UVs...](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201173929/http:/cgi.ebay.com.au/99Fonts-COM-Design-Domain-Name-COM-2yo-PR3-5k-UVs-m_W0QQitemZ300355580786QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item45ee967372&_trksid=p3911.c0.m14 \"http://cgi.ebay.com.au/99Fonts-COM-Design-Domain-Name-COM-2yo-PR3-5k-UVs-m\\_W0QQitemZ300355580786QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH\\_DefaultDomain\\_0?hash=item45ee967372&\\_trksid=p3911.c0.m14\")\n\nCheers,  \nPat\n\n",
