Tatlin also uses the Delta shape for the upper case De and EL, which fit well with geometric designs (but i might question this decision for something so tall...) if i remember rightly, these Delta shaped forms originally are associated with renaissance type, although the triangular El goes back as far as the inception of Peter the Great's [Civil Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204120145/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Civil%2520Type) (someone correct me if i'm wrong on these points).\n\nFor a script-informed sans style, see [this alphabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204120145/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/428260395/) in my flicker stuff.\n\n"
