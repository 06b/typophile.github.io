What if your answers aren't the same as my answers?\n4. What if clients don't like our answers?\n\nHow can we best communicate our subjective feelings about typography? How do _you_ communicate with other people about type? Do you reference a particular aesthetic lexicon or classification system, and are your clients on the same page?\n\nCross-posted:  \n [http://typedia.com/forum/viewthread/97/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130428134028/http:/typedia.com/forum/viewthread/97/ \"http://typedia.com/forum/viewthread/97/\")\n\n",
