The rains are washing the filthy sidewalks almost clean. It’s Spring in New York!\n\n/ / / / /\n\nAnd we have two exciting new releases from Joshua Darden to announce. That is, we have one new release and one really serious update.\n\nThe update is Joshua’s Omnes typeface, which has been available for a few months as a 5-weight set. Joshua has added 4 lighter weights, all the way down to the waif-like “Hairline”, and he has made italics for all weights. The whole package is beautifully-conceived and -drawn, and brings a unique approach to the rounded sans idiom.\n\n[http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140059/http:/vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/\")\n\nThe new face is Corundum Text, a classical serif family based on Pierre-Simon Fournier’s 1742 specimen. Fournier has long been and inspiration for type designers, though his name is not as familiar as his countrymen Garamond or Didot. Joshua’s interpretation balances historical re-enactment and interpretation beautifully.\n\n[http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/CorundumText/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140059/http:/vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/CorundumText/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/CorundumText/mudTyper+Weights/\")\n\nJoshua was featured in Print magazine’s recent “New Visual Artists Review” of talented folks under 30 years of age. (Village was noted in the same issue’s “Hot Type” column.)\n\n/ / / / /\n\nOdile by Sibylle Hagmann of Kontour is almost finished. Watch this space...\n\n/ / / / /\n\nWe have extended the “Typographica Favorites 05” offer for another couple of weeks. Until April 15th, 2006, you can save $290.00 on this critically-acclaimed selection:  \n/ Arrival by Keith Chi-hang Tam from Type Initiative  \n/ Crank 8 by Greg Lindy & Henk Elenga from Lux Typographics  \n/ Flama by Mario Feliciano from Feliciano Type Foundry  \n/ Garda by Mario Feliciano from Feliciano Type Foundry  \n/ Litteratra by Karsten Luecke from KLTF\n\nYou can purchase the set for US$575.00, a savings of one-third off the combined price of US$865.00.\n\n[http://vllg.com/offers.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140059/http:/vllg.com/offers.php \"http://vllg.com/offers.php\")\n\nStay tuned for a new offer when this offer expires.\n\n/ / / / /\n\nWith warm wishes from New York.\n\nVillage  \n168 Second Avenue #253  \nNew York NY 10003  \nUSA\n\ntelephone ++1 646 654 1506  \nfax ++1 646 429 8597\n\n[http://vllg.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140059/http:/vllg.com/ \"http://vllg.com\")\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\n",
