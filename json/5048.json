It's for a fashion magazine -- it needs to be contemporary and a little funky ... readable, lots of different weights and work well as titles and body text. I think this fits the bill really well. Of course I'll consider other options ...!   \n   \nThanks in advance ... xxx<!--attachment: parati-37369.unk*attachment_icon.gif*application/octet-stream*294.5*para+ti+font*parati -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055148im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/octet-stream\">para ti font<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055148/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/parati-37369.unk\" target=\"_blank\"><b>parati</b></a> (294.5 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center>\n<!--/attachment-->\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; Tehnicni podatki - Akzidenz-Grotesk {Yves}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055148/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5056 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#40;x&#41; Classic cadillac logo - custom &#40;similar to English 157&#41; {Mark S, Patricia} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055148/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5050 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
