The client doesn't want to use a serif as a complement for body text.\n\nWhich sans-serif font do you recommend to use for body text that would look good in combination with FUTURA PL?\n\nI'm trying to avoid using Helvetica as the combination.\n\nHere is a draft with FUTURA and Helvetica\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417100945im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Captura-de-pantalla-2014-04-17-a-la(s)-15_6414.40.03.jpg)\n\nThank you!\n\n",
