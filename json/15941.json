They have saddled us with a corporate template that allows for 12pt Infinity ST Medium to be force justified with no hyphenation over a 79mm line length with only 2pts of leading. Because Infinity sets pretty wide (as the name suggests?) and the university uses a lot of long words that don't break, it is all too easy to figure that a good face can be used very badly indeed.\n\nI hope it's treated much better in the the 'man and space' book elsac is working on... after all, it'll be used for display right?\n\nIncidentally Chester did you have anything to do with Infinity Maori or is that just a local variant?\n\n"
