Probably Monotype, at least now that Monotype has purchased Linotype and has a Brobdingnagian portfolio to sell.\n\n"

Because I just saw a thread where you rubbished Adobe for not including various bits and bobs in their OTF fonts and this company doesn’t even appear to sell OTF font formats at all! But I’ll say it again, Conundrum Text is just luscious even though some of the ornaments are dodgy!\n\n"

      "content": "While i am totally biased (being the founder of FontFonts), i hasten to mention that i’ve often heard that we treat our designers very well. They get a very decent percentage of the retail price, detailed reports about who sells their fonts, where there were sold and with what type of license and for which platform. And our fonts still get chosen by a board that has active typedesigners on it. So it is still very much a library by designers for designers. Having a board chosing new fonts (or commissioning them occasionally) does mean less taste control than a 2-person foundry like Emigre can excert, but results in greater variety of expression. Not all my taste, but judging by that alone would have prevented a lof of diverse talent from publishing FontFonts.\n\nAnd don’t forget: a lot of good designers published their first fonts with us, like Tobias Frere-Jones, EvB and JvR, Nick Shinn, Ole Schäfer, Lucas de Groot, Rian Hughes and many others.\n\n"
