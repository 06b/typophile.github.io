I do know that when I saw Berling Nova (a face I like very much)I saw quite clearly the improvements over Berling as was.\n\n"

[Aldus Roman OT](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019192601/http:/www.linotype.com/en/43839/aldusstdroman-charactermap.html) contains 408 glyphs, while [Aldus nova Com Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019192601/http:/www.linotype.com/en/109960/aldusnovacombook-charactermap.html) has 677. Most of them are due to the added support of Central European languages. But Linotype also has added a number of ligatures, ordinals, superscript letters and a wider set of figures.\n- the added Bold and Bold Italic\n\nIt seems every single character has been revised and altered – sometimes sightly, sometimes strikingly (Q, s, t, …).  \nThe ascender length has been reduced drastically.  \nLooking at the italic f, w or y, I have to say that I liked the classic (digital) Aldus better. The new version looks less characteristic. Or less quirky? Maybe it is just a matter of getting used to the new. Maybe Aldus nova has a better colour. And it certainly does integrate better with the other Palatino nova family members.\n\nI think it is impossible to draw any conclusions without having a couple of printed pages, in both versions with otherwise equal settings.\n\nBtw, [John D.
