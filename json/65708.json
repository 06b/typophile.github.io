The closest I've found is Ballantines Script Medium. The problem lies in the \"o\".\n\nAs for the bold, non-script font, I have no idea.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nCataylo\n\n",

You could probably use any of several formal scripts in place of the script used here and no one would notice the switch.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
