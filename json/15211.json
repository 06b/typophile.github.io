I've always thought is was \"pen-wa,\" but several French-speaking students of mine insist it's \"peg-no.\"  \nMy French ain't so hot. Can anyone help?\n\nChuck\n\n",

      "content": "Basically, \"penYOH\" (silent h). Your \"penWAH\" would be a pronunciation of Penoit (like Mandelbrot's given name but with a \"P\"). As for \"pegNOH\", it's somewhat un-French, but might be written as \"Peguenot\" (in which case the [second] \"e\" would be distinctly pronounced though).\n\nhhp\n\n"
