  "content": "GRANDPANTS SANS\n\nGrandpants Sans is a font based on fundamental shapes we learn as children squares, triangles and squares. This new typeface has a tall x-height with some rounded corners to accent the typeface. Tall letterforms and x-height make the typeface legible and breaks it away from just another traditional sans serif typeface. With abstract ligatures the typeface will grab the attention of the designer and create big bold headlines to accent their projects.\n\nThe main purpose of GrandPants Sans is to used as display type. Font pairings will be necessary to give the typeface hierarchy. The typeface has interesting glyphs that would make the typeface distracting and not legible at small size.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140401im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SpecSheetonline_5001.gif)\n\n",
