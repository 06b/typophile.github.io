It is only natural for him to remind us of how Comic Sans came about, and why. Vinny's brief certainly wasn't \"create a new typeface that will destroy western typography and civilization as we know it.\" Yet, sometime we treat it like that was exactly what some old guys in big suits around a table must have been thinking.\n\nSomeone needs to open up a reality check on the truth of the matter.

I used it to indicate Pantone color specs, creep bleeds, or varnish KOs. It separated itself from the text of the piece enough to be clear that it was not part of the printed piece. The beauty is that everyone on earth has it so you know it will show up. It has its uses for others but can also be abused by those who wouldn't be able to do a decent job with any type either. It has been bashed so many times that you wonder why some people just can't let it go. Of course I bash Bush all the time without mercy so maybe I am just as guilty so I will shut up before I start in on him again.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
