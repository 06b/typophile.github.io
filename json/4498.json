      "content": "Besides the name? Just kidding.   \n   \nI don't think the pickel illustration is necessary. In fact, since I don't think there is any relationship between pickels, nickels and jewelry I think I would deemphasize the pickel. The name is cutesy, so I think I would focus on the type rather than the literal pickel.   \n   \nYour service description indicates that they are in a specialized/specific market (b/w photo jewelry). Have you thought of any ways to indicate what they do or what their product is?   \n   \nI will reiterate\n\n"

That, of course, makes sense relative to the cravings that pregnant women are known for.   \n   \nIf these charms are to be distributed through in-home parties, then the title might suffice, but if you're looking to expand into retail or catalog sales, then I think you'll need to come up with something that makes sense to the non-Huntsmans.   \n   \nMy wife has a friend who sells a similar product under the title, Charming Connections. Brainstorm some elements (both physical and emotional, literal and implied) that are relevant to your product/service, then go from there.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"
