To win, you need to name at least:\n  1. typeface\n  2. weight\n  3. character/glyph\n- Show off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.\n- The winner produces a new challenge — a portion of a glyph, black on white background, presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.\n\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.\n\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\n\n_With respectful thanks to the originator of this utterly useless but highly entertaining waste of time, the often imitated but never duplicated Cheshire Dave._\n\n [‹ \"Circus\"--Missing Numbers](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013084151/http:/typophile.com/node/16588 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [font id help link updated ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013084151/http:/typophile.com/node/16591 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This typeface was recently added to the FontFont library, and first appeared in its Catalogue 2004-05 Addendum, on page 3. It covers Extended Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.  \nI find it amazing the way she handled the curves. It’s a beautiful typeface full of (Czech) character.\n\n"

The threads that go into the **Hanpicked** category are indeed literally handpicked by the moderators. For example I promoted Joe’s birthday thread to the front page for one day only and removed it after that. The **Hottest:** category is somewhat more complicated, so I’ll let Christian do some ’splainin’:\n\n<cite>“The algorithm that picks the hottest simply picks the threads that have the most posts in the last four days. So a thread that got a lot of attention on the first day, but none on the next three will drop off quickly. A thread can’t just rest on its laurels, it’s got to stay hot. We decided to do it this way so that the content would cycle pretty quickly and stay fresh.”</cite>\n\n"
