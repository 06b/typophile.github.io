However, I thought I'd also ask what other text strings you use when tweaking metrics and kerning. So...aside from the default preview.txt, are there any text strings you've found especially useful when tweaking metrics and kerning?\n\n",

The purpose in caligraphy is as a pracrice excersize but find it is a good way to check side bearings,  \nIn case \"Neclace\" is not self evident; the idea is to type out the alphabet with a letter N between each letter and then the same with o.  \nANBNCNDNEN...anbncndn...
