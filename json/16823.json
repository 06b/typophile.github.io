  "content": "Good evening,\n\nlast night my old good Sony Trinitron left me with words \"no input signal\" on its screen and its broken connector in my hands. I cannot imagine how come in my always empty room the two pins of the connector got \\*that\\* much... literally severly bent... but this is what it is.\n\nSo after a night full of grief and sorrow, I have decided there might be a new monitor coming my way (it wasn't planned, no, I need money elsewhere). And I even got this shallow to think of an LCD replacement.\n\nI am currently looking at BenQ, Iiyama, EIZO (though more with envy than with intent) and, ahem, Sony. I am looking at this forum through Iiyama 19\" CRT screen and should confess, it seems to be a pretty good fella. But it's way too big for my coffee table. :/ So, yes, it should be an LCD.\n\nOh, no, I am not mistinterpreting this forum — exactly your perspective on the question has importance to me, not the CNet/ZDNet clique.\n\nCheers,  \nAlexey\n\n",

(Sony Trinitron CRTs look blurry by comparison). Samsung and Dell's are both bright and good quality (I prefer Samsung over Dell), but you don't get the same crispness as the Apple display, especially with on screen reading, where it matters most. The Dell 21\" has an LG screen inside, just like Apple's 20\" product and it's funny how the picture is just not as clean as it is on the Apple display. The Dell form factor is pretty ugly, by comparison.\n\n"

Apple Cinema Display better?\n\nThe marketing people from Apple surely are convincing, a pity that the technology doesn't support that.\n\nThe 24-inch Dell UltraSharp 2405FPW LCD comes with 500 cd/m2 brightness, 1000:1 contrast, 12 ms response time, and a 3-year warranty at $900 (5-year warranty at $940).\n\nThe 23-inch Apple Cinema HD Display M9178LL/A LCD comes with 270 cd/m2 brightness, 400:1 contrast, 16 ms response time, and a 1-year warranty at $1,300.\n\nBoth have the same 1920 x 1200 native resolution, the same viewing angle. The Apple monitor is thinner and lighter (but it's also 1\" smaller), and it comes with Firewire that Dell doesn't.\n\nThe Dell is 30% faster, 85% brighter, has 150% more contrast and is 30% cheaper than the Apple monitor. But it doesn't come with a picture of Steve Jobs in the box. If you only work at nights or with completely closed curtains, get the Apple, otherwise get the Dell, because that actually is up-to-date technology.\n\nOf course, instead of the Dell, you can also choose the 24-inch Samsung 244T, which offers 500 cd/m2 brightness, 1000:1 contrast and an unbelievable 8 ms response time (that's twice as fast as grandpa Apple), and costs about the same as the Apple. But it also doesn't come with a picture of Steve Jobs in the box.\n\nPick a monitor from one of the companies that understand how to manufacture LCD panels: Samsung, Dell or Eizo. Forget cheap knockoffs like BenQ or Iiyama. And forget Apple Cinema Display, which represents the state of LCD technology from three years ago.\n\nA.\n\n"

Is it because it's not DVI?\n\nWe selected the Apple and Samsung displays because we can lease Mac and PC gear from one source without creating a separate lease agreement with Dell. That said, I still don't see the difference you're talking about with the Dell 21\" vs. the Apple 23\". The specs I read at time of purchase suggested the Apple 23\" and Dell 21\" had the same LG hardware inside. But I'm not going to dig up the specs now... I'll leave that for Adam. =)\n\nMaybe the Dell 24\" is special, but I can't get past the crappy black plastic hardware and wonky (big) foot piece. Honestly, talk about being years behind in the industrial design department.\n\n"

Any of those options, though, are a bit out of my budget. Neither 23\" Apple nor 24\" Dell are coming my way this time. It's 19\" up to 350 (okay, okay... 375) euros. Thus all \\>20 LCDs are being left out.  \nDell is good? I've never had an impression Dell was something quality-like. Hm. NEC, maybe?\n\nThanks for the input(signal).\n\nps.
