Have decided to try and replicate the typeface used on the back on australian (melbourne) train tickets - its probably just a standard font used for receipts and such but i couldnt find any info on it so thought it probably easy to make my version of it,\n\nAnyway i would love your comments, it obviously needs work its still very new but i quite like it. \"daily fare\" is in extended version, everything else in normal and I am going to make a thin version aswell\n\nThanks for comments - sorry for poor quality\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [METCARDv1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143042/http:/typophile.com/files/METCARDv1.jpg) | 606.74 KB |\n\n",
