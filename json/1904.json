These are so strong, that given the probable use of this font more would enhance it.   \n   \nYou might consider making a shorter J - more on the order of the tail of the Q the standard, and the long descender an alternate. Also should the foot of the L be a little shorter for spacing purposes?   \n   \nIn this installment of daidala:   \n [http://daidala.com/07feb2003.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012082835/http:/daidala.com/07feb2003.html)   \nJon Coltz interviews Jonathan Hoefler, and if I remember rightly, here Hoefler he says some interesting things about an all upper case font vs one with lower case.

In most type families, both oldstyle and lining versions of \"6\" and \"8\" will have the same height. Which is usually something very close to the caps-height.
