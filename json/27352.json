  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm trying to find a typeface that's similar to this sample. The original is from the 1880s and I'm guessing hand-lettered. So I'm looking for a font that shares most of its characteristics, especially its width to height ratio (on the wider side), stroke thickness (relatively thin), and its very small curlique embellishments. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720192007im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sutro_5640.jpg)\n\n",
