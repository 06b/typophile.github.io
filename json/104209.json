  "content": "Hey!\n\nI was wondering if anyone could suggest any fonts like this one (I'm assuming this was hand drawn). I need a classy script font for a client's Deluxe Kombi Van Service but I don't want to pour in hours drawing it myself by hand.\n\nHe does a lot of events like weddings so I'm looking for something that looks quality, elegant, a little bit retro and a little bit  \n'hipster'.\n\nAppreciate any help, cheers!\n\nBilly.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [deathofcool-script.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019145911/http:/typophile.com/files/deathofcool-script.jpg) | 63.84 KB |\n\n",
