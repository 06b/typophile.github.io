It is probable that Anne and Jules may marry in Orlando, but impossible Pica and Cícero doing the same.  \nThe names work well as words, as the time differs between so illustrious names. I used two colors, deep black and gold as to give it a very formal approach. The second picture show the tracing to extructure the text. It is not as good as Villard's diagram for what I could call it, St. Andrew's diagram.  \nI will be very much appreciative of your comments. Please, Ladies, your comments are very important, as I am trying to design a line of invites for sometime now thinking about all of you.  \nThe text is set on a script I am trying to understand and the gothic is Engraver's Gothic BT.\n\nI thank You in advance.\n\nAndré\n\n",
