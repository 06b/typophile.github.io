Apart from the excessive emphasis on bass, the N-Tunes sound as good as you'd expect them to given their price. Sound is rich and full, midtones and highs are crisp and well isolated, and if you use an equaliser to tone down the bass, they can stand their ground against anything similarly priced. But considering how many corners Monster appears to have cut while keeping the cost of the headphones high, they're impossible to recommend over the likes of Marshall's superb — and half the price — Major [http://www.cityofcoventrynhshealthcarecentre.nhs.uk/cheapuggbootsuksale....](http://web.archive.org/web/20131201215749/http:/www.cityofcoventrynhshealthcarecentre.nhs.uk/cheapuggbootsuksale.html \"http://www.cityofcoventrynhshealthcarecentre.nhs.uk/cheapuggbootsuksale.html\") cheap ugg boots sale headphones or a pair of midrange Beats. If, on the other hand, money is no object, then the likes of Parrot's Zik headphones are also a better bet, as are some of the top-end Bob Marley-branded cans.Frankly, despite their audio capabilities, Monster's N-Tunes leave the impression they're intended for those who are more concerned with how headphones look around their neck than the sound they produce. We'll trade aesthetic considerations [http://www.adambickel.com/canadagoosejacketsusa.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131201215749/http:/www.adambickel.com/canadagoosejacketsusa.html \"http://www.adambickel.com/canadagoosejacketsusa.html\") canada goose USA online store for functionality and accessories any day. — (c) 2013 NewsCentral Media.The \"Beets\" headphones by OrigAudio are a clear play off of Dr. Dre's famous \"Beats\" brand headphones, but that doesn't mean that they're a knock-off. The quirky and almost satirically advertised phone includes a can of beets that shipped with the phone and has beets as logos on both sides of the earphones. The headphones cost a modest $25 and come in a variety of colors including black, pink, green, red white and blue. While these aren't high-end premium headphones their sound quality is fairly good, the build is sturdy and the noise-canceling abilities are alright.Overall, if you want a good set of headphones that won't break the bank [http://www.yasc.ca/canadalv.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131201215749/http:/www.yasc.ca/canadalv.html \"http://www.yasc.ca/canadalv.html\") Louis Vuitton Canada Online Store the \"Beets\" by OrigAudio are definitely worth considering. Plus, if you buy them you're also supporting a good cause. For every pair of \"Beets\" OrigAudio donates a can of beets to the Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County. The pair we got also came with a $10 gift card in addition to the beets can.By [Monster Dre Beats UK](http://web.archive.org/web/20131201215749/http:/www.ingleboro.co.uk/monsterbeatsuk.html) the same token, sound leaks are kept to a minimum, even at high volumes. The N-Tunes packaging is as minimalist as the included accessories. Monster supplies only the headphones, a short 1m cable and a cleaning cloth. There's no case or carry bag included, and it's disappointing that Monster doesn't include [Louis Vuitton Handbags For Sale](http://web.archive.org/web/20131201215749/http:/www.provancher.qc.ca/louisvuittoncanadaonline.html \"Louis Vuitton Handbags For Sale\") a 3,5mm to 0,25-inch adaptor, particularly given their R1 999 price tag. Also, not doing so seems to reinforce the message that the N-Tunes are not for audiophiles, but for those who prize form over functionality. It's also frustrating that the included cable is so short. Because it has plugs on each end — rather than being permanently affixed to the headphones themselves — Monster could easily have included a second, longer cable to give consumers greater flexibility and choice. This [Canada Goose Jackets Outlet](http://web.archive.org/web/20131201215749/http:/www.lecare.ca/canadagoosejacketstoronto.html) is all the more annoying given that cables are Monster's core business.\n\n",
