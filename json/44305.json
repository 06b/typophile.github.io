The fonts are all named using the system found at this link:\n\n[http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mvie...](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809200033/http:/groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=1&ID_Message=2843 \"http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mview=1&ID\\_Message=2843\")\n\nEverything works fine in Adobe applications, such as InDesign, Illustrator on the mac and PC. In these programs all the weights are under the same name and are ordered from light to bold, however, when testing the fonts in windows applications, such as Word, big problems!!!\n\nNot all the weights appear in the font menus.\n\nIs there a solution to this problem, or is it just that OpenType fonts don't work in applications like Word?\n\nWhat do other people use as a solution to the problem?\n\n",

The medium weights will be available when you choose the light style and press the Bold button.  \nThis is correctly set up in your table.  \nSince you have 8 styles it's easy to break this down to two families with 4 styles (reg/ita/bold/bold italic) each.\n\n"

Omitting this for the \"regular\" can actually cause problems in some situations (notably for Type 1 fonts with more than one font in the family, in Adobe app font menus).\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

If there is \"Regular\" present in TT OTFs, Freehand/Mac cannot find the font.\n\n_BUT:_ Reading my descripting and older emails again, I have a suspicion that in the problematic test fonts there was a \"Regular\" not only in the PS Font Name but possibly also in the Full Name. Then it would have been the Full Name causing the cross-platform font identification problem! Hope I can repeat this test (much) later -- no Freehand on my current Windows machine.  \nIf what I suspect is true, I should re-phrase: If you generate TT OTFs, \"Regular\" is _not required_ in PS Font Name, as can be seen in MS's own TT fonts.\n\n"
