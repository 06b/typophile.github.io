  "content": "I am looking for a new typeface to use for an existing line of quote t-shirts...and I am having a hard time. It is simply a quote printed at approx. 60pt. type...two or three lines of text...on various colored t-shirts...usually a front print. The existing font that has been used is Book Antiqua bold. These shirts are sold in a family of nostalgic general stores. Here are some basic guidelines for what I am looking for:\n\nNot too modern...or too cliché in terms of old-fashioned typefaces.\n\nSomething that wouldn’t be completely inappropriate in an old general store.\n\nNeutral enough to appeal to men, women, and children of all ages.\n\nEasily distinguishable from previous typeface.\n\nEasy to read from a distance.\n\nAny suggestions? Thanks.\n\n [‹ \"Goodyear\" tire company font...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080125221411/http:/typophile.com/node/41032 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Plural words that require small caps ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080125221411/http:/typophile.com/node/40920 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
