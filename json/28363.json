  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nI'm wondering whether it is possible to teach Indesign CS2 the actual DPI-value of my screen, so it displays an object that is 10cm wide as 10cm in 100% Zoom. At the Moment, I have to zoom to about 130% to get an 1:1 equivalent, which is not very handy...\n\nI remember Xpress 4.0, where this was possible, so maybe Indesign can do it as well? Changing the DPI-value on system level (Windows) doesn't seem to change anyting.\n\nThanks for your help  \nSebastian\n\n",

Even with a hi-res display and your text-rendering engine tuned right up, you're still looking at clumsy pixels on the screen, thus your display will never provide a decent representation of good crisp ink (or even half-assed toner for that matter).\n\n"

Though it's still not logical that I have to zoom to 131% to get a 100% view :)  \nSo listen Adobe: CS3... feature-request... hear the users... you know...\n\naluminium: of course your're right. And this happens just to me, who is preaching everyone the meaning of dpi, ppi, lpi, pixel, resolution, etc.\n\njason: it's useful to judge proportions, compare to hardcopies, etc. Of course, for typographic details, it's quite useless.\n\n"

It works in Xpress and Acrobat 7, and I was looking for the same thing in Indesign.\n\nBut it's okay anyway... It works, so logic is secondary.\n\n"
