It's a brand about cacao milkshakes.\n\nHere i have some images of the main logo:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317190544im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_6325.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317190544im_/http:/typophile.com/files/proj_logo_648_3440.jpg)\n\nAnd there is one with the brand emblem, a boy with a bottle and a bag:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317190544im_/http:/typophile.com/files/project_cover_3672.jpg)\n\nThank you all, guys!\n\nEDIT:  \nYou are right, guys. It's a similar variant of the \"Coca-Cola\" font.  \nOn the \"kthomps5\" links you can find Coca-Cola font is a combination of \"American Pop One\" and \"American Pop Two\".  \nIn my case, Cacaolat is only American Pop One, corresponding at the \"Coca\" from \"Coca-Cola\", so the font has been found.  \nThank you all, and thank you kthomps5 for the links!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n American Pop One \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [kthomps5](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317190544/http:/typophile.com/user/175823 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
