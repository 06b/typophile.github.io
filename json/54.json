I realize this can be created using a program like Fontographer, but was hoping for a quicker, easier solution. I haven't been able to figure it out. Thank you in advance, and please feel free to e-mail me your response: [kenny.eicher@imgusa.com](mailto:kenny.eicher@imgusa.com)\n\n",

      "content": "I'm not sure about the PC solution, but on a Macintosh, the macron can be accessed by typing [option][shift][comma]. It is an independent character (where it is included in a font's characters set at all), and must be manually kerned over the character which it accents.   \n   \nTo get the effect you requested, you would have to type an \"o\", then type \"[option][shift][comma]\", then kern the two together. Yeah, it's lame, but I haven't found any other way to do it other than to create the accented character in a special auxilliary font.   \n   \nAnyone else have another solution?   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
