I wanted to steer clear of curveballs for my own learning purposes. I was shooting for rounds that gave a nod to, but weren't squared (like bank gothic or eurostile extended). Also this is my first time to attach a swf. Hope it works.   \n   \n-Randy!-/attachment-!\\>!-attachment:\\> \n",

As mentioned in the first post, I was trying to design something that, as marc mentioned, is less geometric (the shoulders of the letters aren't nearly as square).   \nIn fairness though, the lower case is quite Eurostile-ish, particularly where the branches/bowls meet the vertical stems. I may have to rework the way these join to reference Novarese less. Thoughts?   \nAll that aside, my favorite is the uc G.   \nThanks.   \nRandy\n\n"
