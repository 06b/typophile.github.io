  "content": "Named after its original creator, typeface designer Sumner Stone, the new 24-font ITC Stone® Sans II suite of typefaces expands range of widths and weights offered by the original ITC Stone Sans design.\n\nIn his role as lead designer and project director, [Sumner Stone](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003423/http:/www.fonts.com/AboutFonts/DesignerProfiles/SumnerStone.htm) collaborated with Jim Wasco of Monotype Imaging and typeface designer Delve Withrington to rework the original ITC Stone Sans design. One of the objectives was to include an expanded range of widths and weights. “These fonts had enjoyed great popularity for many years – during which graphic designers repeatedly asked for more weights and condensed designs in the family,” said Stone. “Their comments were the impetus.”\n\nITC Stone Sans II comprises 24 typefaces, including six weights ranging from light to extra bold. An italic counterpart and suite of condensed designs complements each of the weights. The ITC Stone Sans “super” family of 48 typefaces includes the original ITC Stone Sans design, along with the ITC Stone Serif, ITC Stone Humanist, ITC Stone Informal and now the ITC Stone Sans II typeface families. ITC Stone Sans can be viewed online on a wide range of websites including [www.fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003423/http:/www.fonts.com/ \"www.fonts.com\"), [www.itcfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003423/http:/www.itcfonts.com/ \"www.itcfonts.com\"), [www.linotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003423/http:/www.linotype.com/ \"www.linotype.com\") and [www.faces.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003423/http:/www.faces.co.uk/ \"www.faces.co.uk\").\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003423im_/http:/typophile.com/files/StoneSansII_hires%20small_6340.JPG)\n\n",
