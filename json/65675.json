  "content": "The font \"Helvetica Neue 75 Bold Outline\" sold by Adobe is faulty.\n\nMore than two dozen glyphs are NOT online, but solid black:\n\nsee [www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/Helvetica-75-outline.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120113110600/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/Helvetica-75-outline.jpg \"www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/Helvetica-75-outline.jpg\")\n\nThis is highly interesting, because the seemlingly same outline font sold by Linotype does NOT have these faults.\n\nThis means that (at least some of the) seemingly identical fonts sold both by Adobe and Linotype are NOT identical, so that it make a difference from where you get them.\n\n",

ITC Galliard Std sold by ITC does contain these characters.\n\nExcept from that there can be big differences in the quality of the hinting, dependent from where you buy the fonts. Linotype does not care as much as Adobe about hinting. The appearance on screen can be big, dependent from where you buy the fonts.\n\nSo, if you want to buy a font, that is available from two or more foundries, you have to compare them, although the fonts have exactly the same name.\n\n"

The files are not free, but the usual price is only €1 per work, regardless of length. The following explanation appears on the website: \"Internationally, sound recordings are protected for 50 years from the end of the year in which they were first released (in the USA, the legislation depends on the States). That means, any recording published or released to the public before 1959 is now out of copyright, i.e. in the public domain.\"\n\n"
