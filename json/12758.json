      "content": "I have a suspicion that the square SpongeBob type sample you showed is a custom font, since this is about as highly commercialized a cartoon as anything outside of Disney. My main reason for saying this is that searches for information about SpongeBob fonts have only led me to some vaguely similar styles, such as the free fonts at [this site](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919172628/http:/members.outpost10f.com/~lindax/spongebob/fonts.html).\n\nIf that free font isn’t close enough, be prepared to search through all the S fonts at all the free sites you know, for font names that start with Sponge or Square.\n\nFor commercial designs that may have similar styles, I would look at Device fonts, Font Diner, Chank and Fonthead.\n\nJust in case, I am looking in [Part 14 (Strange, Distressed Scripts), of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919172628/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg1.html), but I do not expect to find this font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

It is called ’Dam’ by Matthew Austin Petty from [Disturbed Fonts](http://web.archive.org/). In my opinion this would be a great substitute for the SpongeBob type you were looking for. It’s certainly closer than the one on that other site in my previous post. I hope this works for you.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
