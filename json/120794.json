  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI'm doing an assignment on the influence of photography in Swiss Style/ITS.  \nAs in how did photography came about in Swiss Style.  \nI found sources writing it gives an impression of realism and more drama, I found more similar answers but I am looking for a more in-dept answer, I'll really be very grateful if I get your replies.\n\nThanks in advance for your comments on this topic !  \nShantal\n\n",
