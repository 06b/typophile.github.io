      "content": "You’re probably right about it being hand lettered. While i agree Bookman has some similarities, this is more of a slab style, especially with the top serif on the A and the E serifs. I started scanning through the McGrew book on metal typefaces, hoping to find something that might have been a model. So far the closest I have seen is a type called Mastodon, although its A does not have the top serif. It was an early 1900’s typeface from the Hansen foundry. It survived into the era of film types, because it is also shown in the Phil’s Photo book “Homage to the Alphabet” from 1985.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Years ago, the long-defunct Fontbank offered [Cache Heavy](http://web.archive.org/web/20080322021024/http:/www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/cache.htm). It was, essentially, a heavier weight than existed of [Cushing](http://web.archive.org/web/20080322021024/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-cushing/). It’s impossible to tell from the lousy Buyfonts.com image, but the L and T are near-perfect matches and the I-O-N-E are quite close. There are better matches for the A, R & S, but not - especially in the case of the R - in a font that is otherwise similar.\n\n"
