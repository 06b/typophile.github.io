  "content": "Hi all,\n\nCan someone please help with a kerning problem or at least point me in the right direction? I am creating a cursive font. (apologies for the lengthily explanation below, I hope it makes sense!!)\n\nAttached are three screenshots – 1) showing the two glyph variations of the letter ‘a’ joining up smoothly within the metric window 2) showing the preview panel correctly substituting the second glyph and smoothly joining up and 3) the output in MS WordPad when I try to get the same result as above. As you can see, the ‘calt’ substitutions work correctly, as all the glyphs displayed are the ones without an entry stroke, except for the first character. However, as you can see, the spacing is not correct for every glyph displayed after the second character. The fact that the spacing is correct between the first two characters seems to show that it is possible for WordPad to pick up on the kerning, I just can’t figure out how to do it for EVERY glyph instance repetitively. The same issue applies to Word 2007.\n\nIf anyone has any idea why I am getting this problem or where I can go to find a solution I would be most grateful – I have searched through this forum, the FL Manual, the Fontlab msn user group, VOLT user group, and various other reference sites. I really need to get this sorted urgently as other people are relying on the finished font.\n\nIs the issue associated with using PUA glyphs? I have tried including the kerning encoding MAC with PUA (also attached as screenshot) but this didn’t help. I’m using FL 5.04. Surely if PUA is the issue, the first substitution would not join correctly?  \nI have read the other posts in this forum but nothing suggested there helped.\n\nIf you need a sample font / .vfb file, I cam mail it.\n\nThank you so much in advance,\n\nNikki\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Fontlab_Preview_5516.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Metrics_window_5782.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/WordPad_screenshot_4288.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/kerningOtpions_window_4827.JPG)\n\n [‹ Multiple diacritics](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211951/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42992 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [RoboFab Sidebearings Script ? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211951/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42955 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Although I do need to get the kerning working without support for complex script activated (is this even possible???)\n\nSince it seems to be a Microsoft issue, I think I’ll try doing the kerning within VOLT...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/In_Design_screenshot_5175.JPG)\n\n"
