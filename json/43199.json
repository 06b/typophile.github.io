  "content": "I have something odd going on with Safari. I know I can just use firefox, but I'd like to figure out what's going on. I just got a new iMac, and everything was fine. I then added all my font files to my library, and this happened to the majority of the text I see in my web browser window:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107165631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-1_4902.jpg)\n\nIn my preferences, I have my standard font set to times, and my fixed-width as courier. Does anyone know why this is getting overwritten, how I can fix it, or even what this hideous typeface is?\n\n",

The best way to solve the problem, without having to hunt down the offending font and delete it, is to clean your font caches. Font Finagler will do it 10 times for you before you have to pay for it and FontExplorerX will do it for you completely for free.\n\nAny time you have a weird font problem—when this problem happens usually the text is completely illegible; like opening up a data file in a text editor—the first thing to try is cleaning your caches.\n\n"
