      "content": "That is really beautiful. I cannot read any of the Indian scripts (except those based on Arabic) so I see your font as pure abstract calligraphic shapes. Inspired by a particular style of Japanese calligraphy I developed my own style of brush-drawn Arabic, and some of my shapes resemble some of the curves in your font. Can you please display some large close-ups of a few words or letters with your font? I want to see how you treated the lines - strictly monoline (same width) or modulated. If modeulated what criterion did you use to decide where it should be thick and where thin?\n\n"
