The Cheesy Teen story, The romance, the slasher flick, the mystery thriller, The coming of age with plot twist, a low-standards comedy and the art house indie flick. And when you try to cram that much into a movie without any sort of control or organization you're going to get a mess of a movie.\n\nAnother sucky movie that I watched recently was the remake of Wickerman... don't ever see this movie, ever! It's complete drivel and Nick Cage must have had a lobotomy right before he signed to do it.\n\nOne movie I've seen that I really enjoyed though was Brick.
