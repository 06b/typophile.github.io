The highest offer will be notified by reply email, and then I would request the amount sent to me in the form of a money order or a bank transfer.   \n   \nIf there's not enough time to complete the process by the exiration day, I will renew the registration on my end with the understanding that the registration amount will be added to the price. Or I will redo the auction with a fully renewed domain, which should simply bring a higher price.   \n   \nThis message being public, I presume it can take the place of a legally binding contract. If not, feel free to write something up for me to sign.   \n   \nhhp\n\n",
