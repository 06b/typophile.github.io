  "content": "In the 1960s Georg Salden designed an opening advert for an hat shop in Dusseldorf. With a broad-nib pen he wrote a bold italic with large swashes. From this written text he later developed [Daphne](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225/http:/www.typemanufactur.com/eng/fonts/daphne/overview.html), a strong and sharp-edged typeface which includes a large number of separate swashes. These calligraphic swashes can be added to the letters in any order, which provides hundreds of possibilities.\n\nNow, many years later, Salden decided to develop a script version of his Daphne typeface. Again, written with a broad-nib pen, Salden created an elegant and vital script with luscious swashes and numerous alternate characters.\n\nSee more of the typeface at [TypeManufactur](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225/http:/www.typemanufactur.com/eng/fonts/daphnescript/overview.html) or check out this [Micropage](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225/http:/daphnescript.typemanufactur.com/).\n\nThere is an 50% off introduction offer at [TypeManufactur](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225/http:/www.typemanufactur.com/eng/fonts/daphnescript/overview.html) and at [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ludwiguebele/daphne-script/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/daphnescript640_1_6332.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/daphnescript640_2_4923.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/daphnescript640_3_4055.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [daphnescript640\\_3.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185225/http:/typophile.com/files/daphnescript640_3.png) | 16.73 KB |\n\n",
