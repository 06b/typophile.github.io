And fonts like Gentium that are so multi-purpose they can't really exhibit what you're looking for. So I think what you need is fonts that are Latin but are focused on one single language besides English - like one of those Morisawa winners?   \n   \nBTW, you should check this out:   \n [http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/volume6/issue1/ep075lmf.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526221433/http:/cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/volume6/issue1/ep075lmf.pdf)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
