Using Quark on a day-to-day basis was a blast. I remember it as one of the most responsive and enjoyable programs I’ve ever used. As gamers would say, it had great “playability.” Working in Quark was like improvising on the piano. It had it’s flaws for certain, but for practiced users it all but disappeared under your hands.\n\nAt its height I think Quark enjoyed 85% market share. Unfortunately the company decided to celebrate with intensely predatory pricing, openly hostile customer service and a manic obsession with security. Many of us were openly begging Adobe to hurry up with getting InDesign to market. And I’m sure Quark saw in Adobe the end of their monopolistic spree and tried to squeeze as much out of the market as possible before getting kicked back.  \nI may be wrong, but it seems that these days most Quark users are holdovers from this earlier era. A majority of working designers have switched to InDesign and, unless I’m mistaken, a majority of formal design education in InDesign as well, so it’s what all the kids are using. But surely somebody becoming acclimated to InDesign and _then_ switching to Quark is rather rare?\n\n"

I’d been using an old version of PageMaker that limited me to one-page docs, and I was going to be laying out my very first book. This was not a design job. Quark 3 was what the book packager I was subbing the layout work from had their template in.\n\nAfter awhile PageMaker came out with a version that allowed multi-page docs and books became possible. A non-profit I did book design and layout for over the course of a few years had PageMaker and was not about to spend money and time on the upstart, Quark.\n\nAt the time, no one had been dealing with PDFs. This changed for me around 1999. Once I discovered PDFs and printers began accepting them, I tried to send only PDFs to my clients, retaining control over the native files in case of reprints and new editions. I always described them as “cross-platform, printer-ready PDFs,” hoping it wouldn’t occur to the client that most of the value was in the native files.\n\nWhen InDesign came along, it seemed to be PageMaker on steroids. I learned InDy on version 2, recreating the look of a previously published book’s new edition. It had originally been done in Quark, but whoever had done the first book held on to the native files, so I was hired to create a book that looked like the old one. InDy was easy to learn and use, tho’ through the first CS version I wasn’t much impressed with InDy’s much vaunted type-handling powers. Perhaps it was my growing experience with InDy, but I find that in CS2, I like how it handles type a lot more.\n\nAs I said, most of the places for which I work use Quark. If it’s not a design job, but straight book layout, I’m provided a template. 95% of the time the template is still a Quark template.\n\n"

As I said, my clients use both, I am very fluent in both, and I think a designer does him/herself a disservice by not being able to master both. Quark’s arrogance at the dawn of the OS X era left the door wide open for Adobe to jump in, and luckily for them they got it right.

If you then go back and change the leading of the Paragraph Style, the leading of the Character Style will override it. What the hell is up with that? In Quark, the Paragraph Style contains the leading, the point of Character Style is to apply it only to certain characters or words within the paragraph, not to affect the attributes of the paragraph itself.\n\nI also find it odd that you can change the leading of only one line of a paragraph in InD. In Quark you simply have to place your curser anywhere in the paragraph (or line if it’s one line long) and you can change the leading. In InD you have to select the entire bloody thing.\n\nPlus - why isn’t there a key command action in InD to call up the “Text Frame Options” pane? That is a very useful pane, and it drives me nuts to have to go to the menu each time.\n\nOK griping over for now.\n\n"

So a paragraph style can contain e.g. simply a different color or size, nothing else.\n\nJust try e.g. creating a character style based on a word which is marked bold. When looking into the new character style dialog box, all of the definition fields are empty, there is only one field with “bold” in it.\n\nThis means, if you don’t specify the leading in the character style dialog box, the leading of the paragraph style will be applied unchanged.\n\n"

I could deliver the normal “resource constraints” and “feature trade-off” excuses but the biggest reason why this feature is difficult for us is that we feel it would be a mistake to have a kern pair editor that could not share the updated kerning with at least Illustrator & Photoshop. That makes InDesign’s ranking of the feature less of a determining factor. We are still working on the global solution and we’re trying to assist plugin developers who are working on InDesign-only solutions.\n\n"

But I will say that since Illustrator and P-shop are not really designed for typesetting it seems to me this feature is less significant there. Not a good reason to hold up implementing it in InD.\n\n<cite>This means, if you don’t specify the leading in the character style dialog box, the leading of the paragraph style will be applied unchanged.</cite>\n\nThe way I create style sheets is to mock up a design I like and then select the various elements one by one and make style sheets directly from them. I don’t know if everyone works this way, but it was a feature of Quark too and it is infinitely easier than creating style sheets from scratch.\n\nWhat happened was that I created a paragraph style sheet for recipe directions and then a character style sheet for the step numbers. I didn’t do anything to the leading when I did that. I later changed the leading in the paragraph style sheet, and it didn’t occur to me that I then had to change it in the character style sheet as well. And then I didn’t notice for a long time that the char. style sheet was overriding the paragraph style sheet and inserting an additional point of lead. Lots of work to go back and fix alignments and such.\n\n"

If Adobe wishes not to recognize a feature that would actually pull potential clients away from their biggest rival, why would I want to put in a feature request? This should have been foundational in V1 or 1.5.  \nChipman: Do you really think IDs counter intuitive box implementation is better than Quarks simple one? After 8 years of V1, V2, CS, CS2 and CS3, I still do not get it, or see its benefit, it is clumsy to me.  \nUltimately, anyone can make either product work quite well, but who does not get miffed when a feature is left out of a competing product, which claims so much superiority.  \nAs many here have pointed out that Quark so inept, why can’t Adobe match this feature? If you believe the engineers at Adobe are so much better than what is coming out of Quark, what is the hold up?  \nSome time back people on Typophile were posting how backward Quark is/was, but to me features of basic typographical control are far more important than transparency, because I can use PhotoShop for most any transparency. There are some features that I love in ID, like the measurement box with 9 points in it, it is great, so precise for print production, far superior to Quark.  \nThe Truth shall set you free\n\n"

It’s brilliant \\*in as much that\\* it’s very fast and although it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles, I can create just about every visual effect that v7 can by way of close integration with Photoshop and Illustrator without spending TOO much extra time on things. Now I’m using v7 on an iMac 2.8GHz (2Gb RAM). Oh dear...\n\nI’m sick to the back teeth of it. It garbles bitmap TIF files and the only way I can get the images to reproduce properly is by replacing them with .psd files, which adds a lot of extra weight to the documents. THEN there’s the issue of PDF creation - it’s cr@p, cr@p, cr@p!!!\n\nQuark 4 - make your document. Utilities -\\> create PDF; wait while Quark creates a reasonably sized EPS file, opens Distiller automatically, produces PDF file incredibly efficiently.\n\nQuark 7 - make document while having to work around its flaws, including the problem just mentioned. File -\\> Export to PDF. Wait while Quark creates an impossibly huge EPS file (a looooooooong time...) and then be amazed when after a similarly lengthy amount of time, a PDF of totally unusable file size has been produced. Doing it through Distiller doesn’t make the file much smaller, but does reduce the time the PDF stage takes considerably. But it’s the EPS file creation that is the real killer - I’m getting Gb sized files.\n\nI’ve pulled my hair out trying to get to the bottom of all of this via various forum discussion - it scares me just how many people come up against this. Does anyone here have any ideas? I’m finding all this pathetic. I have InDesign now. I’m not using it in anger yet, but the beauty of it being able to seemingly easily convert my Quark 4 files is looking all too appealing...\n\nhelp!\n\n"
