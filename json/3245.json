      "content": "Hi Kenny. A nice and simple design. What would improve it?   \nI think it is heavy in the top corners and bottom center. As you properly already know verticals and horizontals will not look the same even if the are exactly the same width, so optical adjustments would improve this. If this is to be used in print (which i assume it is) opening up corners for bleed conpensation would be a good idea. See .jpg for improvement suggestions. ![logo improvements](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121249im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27111.jpg)\n\n"

It's a shame the two letters aren't flipped - but see what you can do with that - it's a natural. Maybe the ascenders can be made into the spine of the book.   \n   \nThe Helvetica/VAG Rounded though is great, especially if it's supposed to be a publisher of children's books.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
