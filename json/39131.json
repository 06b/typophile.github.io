  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nI am currently writing a book on typography in France, and I am looking for any and every information you might have available on Evert Bloemsma and the typeface FF Cocon. I’ve been on his website archive, but the visuals are long gone (especially the 1969 alitalia logo, which I just can’t find)... I saw that there seems to be some really interesting stuff, such as sketches and early versions, on one of the fiffteen exhibition panels, but I can’t find these in a good resolution. So... Any information about the genesis of the type and any visual documents would be extremely appreciated, as well as biographical informations about the late Evert Bloemsma - what I have is quite thin.\n\nThanks  \nDavid R\n\nps: I am in the process of finishing the book and will be heavily looking for visual or informative contributions in the next few month, do not be surprised if I post some requests here and there...\n\n [‹ Digital Type: Pros and Cons?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116055456/http:/typophile.com/node/38961 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The House MD font!? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116055456/http:/typophile.com/node/39143 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
