The 4th year of incorporation, the club can only be joined from now until Jan. 31, 2006. For yourself or for a gift, a great deal. [http://www.p22.com/members/club.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080107113201/http:/www.p22.com/members/club.html)  \n——————————————————————-  \nTHE BOOK  \n—-P22 book and deci-annual report :: ...Thoughts on Ideas for Inspiration towards... ::\n\nThe history of P22, like all history, is filled with a mix of myth, fact, conjecture and legend. The first 10 years of P22 type foundry have transpired with their share of  \nhighs and lows and a legacy filled with many digital fonts and other fine things. This book will in no way give a concise history of P22 type foundry, but rather a lush view into a few select projects and details of the vast P22 empire.\n\nWe could go on and describe the details of the book, but suffice to say it is epic. OK, perhaps not that epic, but the physical attributes are: 10” x 10” in size, about 36 pages, 6 different kinds of paper, metallic inks, die cutting, foil stamping, debossing, varnish overprints, translucent sheets, grommet binding and rare photographic evidence of the elusive staff of P22 in their natural habitat. Limited edition of 2500 copies with 500 set aside for sale. Surely never to be reprinted. Only $19.95 while supplies last (or free with any $200 purchase) See preview at: [http://www.p22.com/products/p22book.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080107113201/http:/www.p22.com/products/p22book.html)\n\n",
