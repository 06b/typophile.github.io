The wh ligs and ending w's appear the same, but at that size I can't be certain.\n\nThat thing with the y's is pretty atrocious. I always find it amazing how something like that can run through whole committees and get unnoticed. I've seen this same behavior when copying type from Freehand to Photoshop. Sometimes descenders run too far below the descender boundary and just get clipped. Turning the type to outlines before copying will prevent that.\n\n"
