  "content": "Hello, was wondering if anybody could ID the font used for some of the display type all over this website. Sorry I can't find a bigger sample--I have a little booklet I picked up but don't have access to a scanner right now. It seems sort of like New Clarendon or New Century Schoolbook or something but off the top of my head the tail on the 'a' looks a little different and it has that weird thingy on top of the 'g.'\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHere's the URL:\n\n[http://systembolaget.se/AlkoholHalsa](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111122145/http:/systembolaget.se/AlkoholHalsa \"http://systembolaget.se/AlkoholHalsa\")\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logga\\_systembolaget.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111122145/http:/typophile.com/files/logga_systembolaget.gif) | 2.83 KB |\n\n",
