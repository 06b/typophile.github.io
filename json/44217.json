Stephen Fry goes in search of the story behind the inventor of the printing press, Johann Gutenberg, travelling across Europe to find out how Gutenberg kept his development work secret, and how his approach started a cultural revolution. </cite>\n\nIn order to fully understand the man and his machine, Stephen assembles a team to help him build a copy of Gutenberg’s printing press as well as learning how to make the paper and type so that they can print as Gutenberg once did.\n\n [‹ M with single left facing serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907092356/http:/typophile.com/node/44422 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Need advice choosing a face ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907092356/http:/typophile.com/node/44435 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The interesting thing is that the movie your link points at, is that it shows a technique that appears to be the way Gutemberg printed his bibles, in a way that each spread with 2 or 4 pages was actually printed (pressed) one page at a time. I will certainly look for this documentary. Thanks for the link.\n\n¡ awesome !\n\n"
