Additionally my apologies as I had previously posted this in the general discussion but it only collected dust there. If some one can explain how to take down my previous post I will.\n\nDose anyone know if Egmont Inline by Sjoerd Hendrik De Roos (S.H. de Roos), which was distributed by Typefoundry Amsterdam, was ever digitized? I believe that Linotype might have the rights to it but I can't find it on there website.\n\nI can't even find a highres sample of Egmont Inline online.\n\nAny high quality fonts that might be an adequate substitute?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

I can recollect seeing it as a font in the latter half of the eighties, (that is how I became aware of it) but I never had the need to use it until now over two decades later. I do not even have a type specimen of it. Only going by my memory of what it looked liked.\n\n"
