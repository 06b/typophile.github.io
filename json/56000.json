  "content": "Here's something I've been thinking about and would love some input on. I'm sure this has been discussed at length before, and I know I'm still in a very early stage of learning, so I'll be equally glad about pointers to older threads, and/or literature.\n\nLooking at [Briem's page on spacing](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020223847/http:/briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.02.method.htm), I noticed he employs the \"glass of water\" analogy to describe correct spacing (\"the same volume of water that filled the counters should also fill the gaps between the letters\"), which is also how I was taught letterspacing at design school.  \nA different description, which —being more functionally-oriented than merely formalistically descriptive— intuitively seems to make more sense, is this one that I just came across in Peter Enneson's article in TYPO #13 (page 26): \"Perceptual distances between letterforms must be great enough to minimize criterial cue confusions or masking. But not be so large that cross-letter binding or constructive conjunction is inhibited.\"\n\nSo here's the question. Especially compared to definions such as Peter Enneson's quoted above, I'm suspecting the \"glass of water\" model is overly simplistic – mainly because of the issue of optical scaling, the need of which I'm not sure it can accommodate. My impression from a typesetting/typography perspective is that the need for a relative expansion of inter-letter space (OK, tracking) is much increased at smaller point sizes. Now I know that optimally, setting text at a smaller size means employing a dedicated optically-sized cut, which (inter alia) increases the relative width and visible counterspace of the lettershapes. But it seems that the _inter_-letter space needs to be adjusted more for smaller sizes than the _intra_-letter space usually is – as in, the adjustments made to intra- and inter-letter space seem not to be linear.\n\nIf this is indeed so, then I'm wondering why. Does the effect of lateral interference increase at smaller sizes? Also, if intra- and inter-letter space do not in fact scale in a linear fashion, how can one talk about glasses of water without factoring in target point size?\n\nOr am I mistaken (and most likely, visually misdirected from working too much with non-optically-sized digital fonts) and in proper optical sizing, the scaling of intra- and inter-letter space actually is parallel/linear, so that the concept of optical scaling does not in fact refute the \"glass of water\" model?\n\n",

I sure hope the adherents of the \"glass of water\" model wouldn't apply the principle mechanically/mathematically (that would be scary), but adjust the space optically – but still _based_ on the \"glass of water\" idea. (FWIW, that's what they taught me at school.)\n\nStill, the metaphor is there and I wonder how much merit it has. How elastic can a glass be (esp regarding the point size question) before it stops being a glass? :-\\>\n\nAs a PS, I just remembered a slightly different metaphor used by Jost Hochuli, who talks about the white as light shining into the lettershapes, which allows for slightly finer gradations (like he says light coming from above is stronger, which is why a sans serif \"u\" needs to be narrower than an \"n\") but still departs from the idea of equal \"light\" inside and around the letters.\n\n"

A big factor is proximity of nearest segment--meaning a serif on a cap V being near a Serif on a cap W. When the two are quite close, the proximity factor begins to overcome part of the visual mass of space issue. It is often impossible to have a space as those between upright adjacent letters like H and N be truly equal to adjacent opposing diagonals like V and Y unless you vastly letterspace. Using the proximity effect minimizes the perceived difference though.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

So, if you are composing type, and you want to see what tracking works, and how the glasses of water are equalized, set a line like iiiniii in the face you are spacing, or IIIHIII if caps, (the i's and l's have 'no water inside' and the n or H show you the how the average inside space relates).

Sorry if I was being confusing. :-/\n\n_\"can you explain what you base this statement on?\"_  \nOK, here comes the big disclaimer: Yes, I was thinking about text vs. small text.

I'll gladly go and see if I can find examples to illustrate this.\n\nThough now I'm wondering if a lot of what I have been seeing is not actually the proper way of doing things, as I'm probably somewhat used to seeing text set at less than the intended point size, and tracked out (hell, they taught us that at school, too). But the interesting thing is, that still is more readable then than when it's not tracked out (and the counters vs. spacing ratio stays the same). And the opposite – a really wide font for small text that's spaced tight – is definitely not going to be easily readable.

FWIW, of course my interest in spacing has been triggered anew by thinking about spacing my font; so this list of criteria you posted seems most helpful in a practical way too.\n\nHey Ben, you might be on to something there – the concepts of clotting, and \"acuteness\" of the eye, sound pretty plausible to me, in the way that it might be an issue of resolution (both of the eye maybe, but more importantly paper and ink), so that the letters need to be separated from each other a bit more?

But not be so large that cross-letter binding or constructive conjunction is inhibited.” Perceptual distance is a cognitive psychology term for how dissimilar or similar letters are. Hrant did some really nice work on this years ago.\n\nPerceptual distances are calculated from letter confusion matrices, which are experimentally derived. For example an a and an e are more often confused than an a and an m, so the perceptual distance between a and m is greater than between a and e. Herman Bouma did some nice charting of perceptual distances that corresponds nicely with Hrant's chart of similars and modulars.\n\nMy comment on spacing follows the passage you quoted. I say: “If spacing between letterforms is not in synchronicity with the space inside enclosed forms—with the way the letterform set uses its cartesian space—there are computation costs at the visual cortex level, because the saliencies can’t compound effectively--the ‘saliency maps’ are thrown off. Configural cues become harder to assemble. Conjunctivities are weakened. The wholistic response bias compromised. So “space craft” facilitates effortless perceptual processing.\n\nI see one factor relating to spacing, and three that relate to scaling for small sizes. For spacing, the blacks must be in step and the whites in synch in spatial frequency terms; for small sizes, perceptual discrimination affordance to the role-unit and evoked-form level must be intact, the ink-spread factor must be accommodated and the dependence of vision on the white must be kept in mind.\n\nBear in mind that ‘in step’ and ‘in synch’ are not mathematically quantifiable. In step is not equidistant and in synch is not equivalent in area. I try to think in terms of rhythmic cohesion with the whites, and narrow but not exact phase alignment with the blacks. Fourier transforms, I believe, can gauge this. The method Berlow describes is a way toward achieving it.\n\nPerceptual discrimination affordance is the visual cortex being able to make out what something, for example a letter-part, is. There are size, crowding, and acuity thresholds here. Making out what a letter-part is means resolving marks into shapes the visual cortex knows. I call this process of resolving ‘quantization.’ Quantization underlies categorical perception, the psychological term for ‘seeing as.’ Seeing a d as a d for instance.\n\nIn relation to the dependence of vision on the white, bear in mind that vision uses reflected light, and the black does not reflect, so if the white is overwhelmed by the black, the fundaments of readability — perceptual discrimination affordance, quantization, categorical perception and rapid automatic visual wordform resolution — all suffer.\n\n"

It's actually not half as exciting as I thought I remembered – I should have quoted it a few hours ago, considering how far this thread has taken us from when I first mentioned this!\n\nThis is from \"Detail in Typography\" (1989); my library only has the German edition, so here's my wobbly and definitely unquoteable translation:  \n[First he goes on talking about the importance of making everything evenly grey with no \"holes\"]… \"Even though the spaces between the lettershapes are not [mathematically] equal, a well spaced word looks even; so this can not be about equal space in terms of areas of space. If we replace the term \"space\" by the term \"light\", everything becomes a lot easier, and we can do without unclear terminology…  \nThe light – the lightness of the letters' environment, the ground – flows into the counters and the spaces between the lettres from above and below; the light that comes from above is more active than the light from below. This brings about the fact that the letter \"n\" in a sans serif needs to be a bit wider than the \"u\" in the same font if they are meant to appear to be the same width optically. In much the same way, the area between \"I\" and \"A\" needs to be less than that between \"I\" and \"V\" (assuming the same angles on the \"A\" and the \"V\"…). This phenomenon cannot be accounted for with the theory of equal areas of space, but very much so with the theory of equal light.\"\n\nI should add this is a tiny book for students/novices. I haven't read anything \"bigger\" by him.\n\n"

One portion of the proof was devoted to checking the fitting intervals and base alignments and consisted of each character in the alphabet alternating between a \"square\" and a \"round\" letter (i.e., H & O for capitals and m & o for lowercase).\n\nSo, this offers an excellent opportunity for us to peer into the kinds of adjustment that were being applied in terms of spacing and proportions, at least in the Linotype approach (ca. 1950s). Griffith & co. prided themselves on carefully adjusted individual drawings for each character of each size, not mere geometric or photographic \"blowing up\" or \"blowing down.\"\n\nBTW, Griffith is quoted as expressing that he felt the Falcon series represented \"an almost perfect proportional curve to the eye.\" (See Walter Tracy's <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>, page 53 for further discussion of this.)\n\n"

There is also the issue of scalar versus absolute relationships, the quality of sharpness and the shape of curves.

I find this exact process to be infinitely enticing (and especially so when it includes actually designing what the reader sees) precisely because it's so complex, not really understood yet, and because it's so close on the border between research/science and design; a tectonic fault between two worlds that is calling for bridges to be built, from both sides.\n\nThank you guys, this is a great discussion.
