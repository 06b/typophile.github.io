These 21 independent typefaces share widths and other metric information so that they can be recombined. Thus History has the potential to generate thousands of different unique styles. History is available as a collection of 21 OpenType fonts that can be used just as any other fonts, and also as part of the layering software [History Remixer](http://web.archive.org/web/20130217042550/http:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/history_remixer/).\n\nAvailable from [Typotheque.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130217042550/http:/www.typotheque.com/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130217042550im_/http:/typophile.com/files/history_04_5087.png)\n\n",
