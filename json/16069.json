Or, to relate this to type, we recognize a lowercase letter a regardless of its typeface, based on certain attributes that have nothing to do with the detail of the particular typeface. Yet it is precisely the unnoticed details which make a typeface readable (or not). I would venture that if the average reader spends too much time focusing on the details of the type, it isn’t doing a very good job of being type.\n\nI’d also apply it to the way we understand and process other kinds of information, not just visual details. We make stories our own by filling in the gaps with our own detail as well as by “smoothing out” the details into something which resembles ourselves.\n\nThe devil \\*is\\* in the detail. You can get bogged down in it, lose all perspective, and become entirely unable to function, but it also makes things work and gives a breath of life to what we do. The average person is intent on the message, not the detail — the writers, editors and type designers take care of the detail so the layman doesn’t have to know or care about saccades.\n\nKristina\n\n"

This sweeping movement is almost invariably smooth and steady, at least within a given word. This would work if we swept our eyes smoothly across each word before moving to the next one, but in reality it just makes them hard to follow. Much more effective are the ones that simply fill an entire word or syllable all at once. An interesting idea would be to fill the bouma-shapes separately where they may be smaller than words and may not correspond exactly to syllables.\n\nEdit: of course, this may aid fast reading, but it might be awkward if you’re trying to sing along.\n\n"
