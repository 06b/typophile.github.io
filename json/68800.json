      "content": "First, I don't think it's the same font. The white lettering on black backgrounds is the same as \"ERYKAH\", but I don't know what font it is. I think the magazine logo is (maybe) a customization that started as a slab serif, but it may have been drawn from scratch. The A is the real oddball, and I can't think offhand of a slab serif with that style A.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
