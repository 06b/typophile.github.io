      "content": "Six hours & no pronouncement from the true font cognescenti!  \nDespite the fuzzy image, I can see a regularity in the lower case that suggests that this is could well be a font -- although some of the old time letterers were pretty consistent. The lowercase scripting is open and conventional with high legibility. But the uppercase of slanted plain letters, at least for the WNOT shown is unusual.  \nIt would help if you could provide some information as to the source of the image, particularly the approximate year, or decade, in which it was originally created, and the country where it appeared. Wild guess, based on the text of the image, your explanation, & profile info, WWII RCAF in England? But then again, I could be completely off base & this is a brand new font created by one of the up and coming foundaries.  \nDon\n\n"

Far from a perfect match, but the ascenders & descenders generally fit the sample's form and length, the weight and slope are about right, and most of the letters are not too far off the sample's cursive.  \nDon\n\n"
