I love designing ambigrams but often times I find myself just designing ambigrams of my own name:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018014814im_/http:/typophile.com/files/matthew_ambi_6484.jpg)\n\nPerhaps it'd be more fun to challenge each other with a word (or two words) and continue the challenge in this thread. Who's got a suggestion for the first ambigram?\n\nThe second challenge should be issued by anyone who can complete the first challenge\n\n",
