He mentioned at the Fonttech workshop in NYC that the x height and baseline should be at the middle of ’cupped’ terminals, not the extremes, for ’flex hinting’ to work properly. I don’t really understand it, but I believe it relates to the blue zones also. Hopefully he can clear it up for you. Me too!\n\n"
