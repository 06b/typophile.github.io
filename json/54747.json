It's a chance to win your favourite [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019160503/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/foundry/fontfont/) or [Ourtype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019160503/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/foundry/ourtype/) typeface of all!\n\nThere's Quadraat, Meta, Din, Mister K, Kievit, Unit, Versa, Scala, Arnhem, Legato… if you love any of these fonts, this is your chance to get a single license of, for example, Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. And you can enter three times, which means you can get three chances to win one font or three chances to win three different faces of your liking! (Not to mention that, if you don't enter, no one will win, because we still need more entries to reach fifty!) So hop to it! ;D\n\n"
