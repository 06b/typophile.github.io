  "content": "I would really appreciate a few suggestions. I should also add that this identity project is a real low budget wonder so I can't buy a font.\n\nThe project is for a southern old country-style press that is printing really modern comics. So I used rosewood fill hand kerned for the logo. Now I have to come up with a font to put everything else in: I want it to go and look intentional, but express the old/new part too.\n\nhere are the sans serif fonts I am considering (own), please help me pick one (it will be in all caps):\n\ninterstate  \nhelvetica neue  \navenir  \nmeta  \nrotis  \nswiss\n\nthanks for any and all suggestions!\n\n",

      "content": "I’d go with something that strong geometric features, a friendly tone, and a classic look to contrast the decoration in Rosewood; Neutraface or Futura would both work, as would Avenir. The neo-grotesks seem less appropriate; they’re a little to cold and inhuman to pair with Rosewood, and even though Meta is warmer than helvetica, interstate and swiss, it feels to new to pair with Rosewood.\n\n"
