And most of those were based upon contemporary French, Italian, and German models.)\n\nBesides Rongel, Mário has released Merlo, and has several more Spanish types in the works: Geronimo, Eudald, Monteros, Salustiana...\n\n[http://felicianotypefoundry.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211529/http:/felicianotypefoundry.com/ \"http://felicianotypefoundry.com/\")\n\nFor contemporary Spanish type, one might check out Type-O-Tones:\n\n[http://www.type-o-tones.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211529/http:/www.type-o-tones.com/ \"http://www.type-o-tones.com/\")\n\n"
