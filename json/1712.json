      "content": "The book from FontShop International, called \"The Font Book\" is the best such book on the market right now. It's expensive ($110 US was what I paid for a new copy), but it's hard to find one book that shows as many fonts that is as easy to use. If that's too steep, consider getting the Catalogs from those two foundries, if that's where your main interest lies. Frankly if you are iterested in only a couple of foundries, their web sites are just as good for seeing what they have (and it's always up to date). I would also suggest including Agfa-Monotype ( [http://fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141049/http:/fonts.com/)), since they have been including many other foundries in their collections, and are becoming one of the more comprehensive sources of fonts. Bitstream's MyFonts.com is another great font resource online, and would show Adobe, Linotype and many other foundries. What Agfa & MyFonts don't cover Phil's Fonts ( [http://www.philsfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141049/http:/www.philsfonts.com/)) often includes, so those three are good resources.\n\n"
