The most obvious issue is with the weight of the 'b,d,p,q' in the lower case. There are other problems with the 'a,c,e,g' that I am working on.

      "content": "I think it's a good project; there's a certain 'genericity' in certain characters (BPRf, for example) but I guess it's just a matter of tweaking the curves, etc. There's a lot of inconsistencies in color (weight); and overall it seems a bit too light (specially the thins). You're right about the bdpq. The bowls need more weight.   \n   \nOther comments:   \n- O: the inner shape looks 'squarish';   \n- Q: tail is too odd and thin;   \n- W: that white shape in the middle (where the two strokes cross each other) is too small, enlarge it or remove it;   \n- X: top heavy;   \n- g: extremely odd shape for this typeface;   \n- y: it needs the inner left serif (IMHO).\n\n"

There was even a few there that I was not aware of.   \n   \nThe grand plan is for the family to include a Katakana, Hiragana and Arabic character set. I have a contact for the Arabic development of the typeface, but I have been unable to locate any Japanese typographers willing to offer some feedback. If anyone has any leads, I would really appreciate it.   \n   \n\\*L\\*\n\n"
