I was wondering what some of you thought about the designs he sent me. He was the manager of a team of product managers for computer accessories (mice, hubs, etc.)\n\nI sincerely appreciate any feedback you may provide.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019030030im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bc2007_mg2_4180.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Lots of questions come to mind; some you may not want the beholder to have to ask. What is Michael Greco? Who is Michael Greco? Is Michael Greco a pair of last names that make a firm or company name? These questions come of the type in 'michael greco' looking too [kind of overbranded] to be a simple first and last name.  \nHaving the luxury of seeing several different specimens, and looking up roadrunner.com to find that it's an internet service provider and most likely not Michael's employer, I get the feeling that Michael Greco is a consultant, marketer or strategist.  \nMy advice would then be to add a word such as 'Consultant' to the design, just to fix the trouble with ambiguity.  \nBeyond that, the type alignment in these designs is too predicable. I think the best direction to work in is D-E.\n\n"
