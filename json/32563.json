This glyph is an abbreviation for ae and has been used since the early middle ages.  \n [http://www.decodeunicode.org/w3.php?nodeId=383&page=1&lang=1&zoom=&prop=](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504031559/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/w3.php?nodeId=383&page=1&lang=1&zoom=&prop= \"http://www.decodeunicode.org/w3.php?nodeId=383&page=1&lang=1&zoom=&prop=\")\n\nas 2-001-002 shows, Frege seems to have used any odd shaped glyph for his equations. And he used them upside down to prevent any misinterpretation as a letter; remember the thread about the pound abbreviation.  \n [http://typophile.com/node/31818](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504031559/http:/typophile.com/node/31818 \"http://typophile.com/node/31818\")\n\nc-spuro2 (also upside down) looks vaguely familiar to me, but I can’t find an example. It is not a c with a cedille.\n\nWolfgang\n\n"

I initially  \nthought an ogonek too, but now I’m not so sure: It looks too  \nbig, it does not curl around to the right-hand side of its  \nhost in the same way (or left, overturned) instead it sort  \nof dangles. Also, the end is rather blunt.\n\nAs a indicator of nasality in vowels it certainly doesn’t  \nbelong on a c, so I though it might be a diacritic from  \nsomewhere else grafted onto them both.\n\nAs to “any odd shaped glyph” I can agree with the “odd”,  \nbut Frege seem to me rather systematic in his symbolism.\n\nCheers\n\nJim  \n—  \n [http://pdfb.wiredworkplace.net/pub/jjg/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504031559/http:/pdfb.wiredworkplace.net/pub/jjg/ \"http://pdfb.wiredworkplace.net/pub/jjg/\")\n\n"
