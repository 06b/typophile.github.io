Do you think its an alternate glyph, an altered Avant Garde, or another font all together? I tried looking for another font that would work like this and Avant Garde is still the closest I can come.\n\n"

You can still see it in some cuts (such as the [ITC version](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017110058/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D52%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3Dkent%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3D%26seed%3D30) Monotype carries).\n\nAdobe did a multiple master version during the '90s. This required that inconsistencies like this among weights be eliminated. The multiple master version is long gone, but the enforced consistencies still remain in their version. The cap \"R\" is another example (victim?).\n\nSo, yes, this is Avant Garde, but some versions available don't match.\n\n"
