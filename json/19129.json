  "content": "Dear typographers &c.,\n\nI’m working on my first book design, which is a dissertation on a subject in (the history of) military science. Although I’ve read my Bringhurst and these forums, I’m having trouble deciding on a typeface. The writer himself has only one demand: that the text be legible, which for him implies rather heavy/dark.\n\nHis writing style is somewhat old-fashioned; perhaps, a little dry too. Should I support the character of the text with a classy but ’boring’ Garamond or Minion? Or would it be better, instead, to liven up the text with something more modern, exciting and quirky, like Quadraat or Dolly?\n\nSo, do you have any suggestions for a serif typeface that, in order of importance  \n(1) is suitable for setting long text (the book will be about 400 pages in size)  \n(2) has nice small caps for headings and nice italics (which are used quite extensively)  \n(3) has something of a ’military’ feel to it (this should, of course, not be overdone)\n\nThank you in advance for any help you can give me.\n\n [‹ Sonopa—Evolution of a Typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021124841/http:/typophile.com/node/19190 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Why is a zero often very contrast-less? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021124841/http:/typophile.com/node/17772 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Too irregular for body text, in my humble opinion.\n\nThe period covered is, to say the least, not too specific: from 1469 BC up to the Cold War.\n\n"

What exactly are the pros of using OpenType fonts, considering I’ve already set up separate character styles for small caps and the like, which can easily be switched back and forth between OpenType and Postscript variants?\n\nBulmer I find not adventurous enough. Kepler I like, but not so much its commas and quotation marks. Whitman and Walbaum are interesting options.\n\nPataline, [Dolly](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021124841/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview) (not OpenType, by the way) is one of the fonts I’m considering. I really like its lively character, which indeed might work to make the dry text a bit more exciting. On the other hand, don’t you think Dolly ( [example pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021124841/http:/www.underware.nl/download/dolly/pdf/Dolly.pdf)) is too happy and friendly a typeface for serious subject matter such as war and its history?\n\nI’ve also come across Slimbach’s Warnock. Would that be acceptable, keeping in mind the subject of the book? I guess Cronos is a good sans companion?\n\n"

Switching to “expert sets” for some characters often breaks spellchecking. Better language support means you’re less likely to be in trouble when you discover the Czech name in your English text.\n\nI set a book in Warnock, because I needed the Greek, and I was very pleased with it.\n\n"
