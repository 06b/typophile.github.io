  "content": "Hi all,\n\ni'm looking to find the blackletter font attached. It appears in Dan x Solo's book 'gothic and old english alphabets' from 1984. Known as monmouth back then, but the blackletter font now also known as monmouth is completely different so the one I want is difficult to search for... any idea if this font was renamed at some point? Similar fonts accepted...\n\nimage attached\n\nthanks\n\na\n\n",
