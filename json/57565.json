I’d like to have some kind of copyright notice on back of title page. Currently I have a placeholder... “Copyright (c) 2009 by XYZ High School. All rights reserved”.... I’d like to include the contributors too, but would prefer to have some kind of blanket verbiage — and not name them all.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks.\n\n",
