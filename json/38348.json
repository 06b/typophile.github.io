Are you using equivalent settings in both applications?\n\n\\> _What are the benefits of exporting PDFs straight from InDesign?_\n\nYou avoid the extra step of having to generate PostScript files and running Distiller to process them.\n\n\\> _Why is it more reliable?_\n\nInDesign has full access to the elements on the page (and their properties) and thus can easily convert them into PDF or PS instructions. But if you have to further process those files, there’s a slight change that somethings won’t be correctly converted (from PDF to PS, or vice-versa). What I’m saying is, it’s better to get to the final format directly from the original, then through a series of conversion steps.\n\nHere’s a real life example: [http://www.typophile.com/node/21264](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907034421/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21264 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/21264\")\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>Mainly to cut file size down. For this job the Distilled PDF is 56mbs as opposed to Exporting the PDF from InDesign which is 756mbs.</cite>\n\nInDesign CS 2 also also allows you output using common PDF standards or to save custom PDF presets. If you find that your exported files are too large, you may want to consider what data in the file is likely to be causing the issue. For example, the Compression settings in the PDF Export Preset dialog will allow you to chose what compression format to apply to images as well as compress text and line art. It’s likely that the preset you’re choosing in Distiller just has different variables. It can be confusing. For typical design documents, I often stick to the PDF/X-1a:2001 preset.\n\n"

Remember that the last update to Postscript (Level 3) was in 1997, while PDF has undergone 3 revisions (1.4, 1.5 &amp; 1.6) since then - with 1.7 coming shortly with the release of Acrobat 8.</cite>\n\n"
