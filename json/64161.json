  "content": "We have purchased a font to use in InDesign CS4 and Word 2003 and 2007.  \nThe font is Truetype and doesn't include specially made superscript-characters.\n\nWord has has the option to set font manually to a different styles like Italic, Bold, Smallcaps and Superscript. The problem is that Superscript doesn't work in fontsizes 7 / 7,5 / 9 / 9,5.\n\nAny suggestions how to solve it or what could be the problem? The font itself is okay, and Word works okay in rendering every other font that I use.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Word.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203134112/http:/typophile.com/files/Word.png) | 271.8 KB |\n| [InDesign.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203134112/http:/typophile.com/files/InDesign.png) | 270.13 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Ok, I could mend it by changing the values of ySuperscript XSize and YSize in the OS/2 Positions table, which were very low (at ca. 20% of the Em Square).  \nIt seems that Word (at certain font sizes?) looks at these values and uses them when they are lower than its own built-in reduction ratios for extrapolated superscripts.\n\nIt seems that hardly any fontmaker cares about these values since they seem to be ignored by modern software - but apparently not by all and under all circumstances.\n\nPlease contact your font vendor if you cannot - or aren't allowed to - fix that yourself.\n\nAndreas\n\n"
