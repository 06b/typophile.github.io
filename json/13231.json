Of course, for parents I suppose it is always easier to find something (or someone) else to blame for a child's bad behavior.\n\n"

And as always, marketers are there to repackage old snake-oil.\n\n---------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I still wear beads and sandal!\n\n"
