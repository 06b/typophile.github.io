After James' enthusiasm I was motivated to continue on with the project based upon the original 'g' glyph that I drew out. Here is my progress after a few glyps. Does this look cohesive and going in the right direction? Ideas/Comments/Crits are welcome!

Whereas \"h\", \"a\" and \"c\" typically provide key elements.\n\nNext step: skew that \"n\" upwards and right-a-ways to make it match the motion of the \"g\", then make the \"n\" into an \"h\", and keep extrapolating from there.\n\nWhat you've drawn so far looks similar to a completed font of mine, name undecided;\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424023603im_/http:/typophile.com/files/buttered.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424023603im_/http:/typophile.com/files/elstrange-ocatfood.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424023603im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tamyerocks350x210.gif)\n\nThis one is a Cooperesque display/text hybrid with a heavy cursive influence, designed for packaging and poster work.\n\nFeel free to assimilate elements and details you feel will be useful---whatever fits in :^)\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Sorry, but I don't understand your skew suggestion... :-/\n\nI was actually going to say something, where I knew most typefaces are started with the 'h' and the 'o' so I was planning on getting to the 'h' next. The only reason I did the 'n' and 'e' is because at the same time as I sketched the 'g' I sketched out an 'e' and 'n' for some unknown reason. :-D\n\nI'll have to get back to this at work on Friday, but for now I would like to see what people think. If anything I'd like to complete this and have it to use in layouts and such...as I don't own any font-creation software.\n\n"

Once you've designed certain key parts, a font almost designs itself.\n\nSuggestions:  \n\\* shorten the descenders by 35%  \n\\* slant the stem (right side stroke) of \"a\" to the right  \n\\* try bending/curving the right side strokes of m, n, h to the left in a sweeping continuous arc, eliminating the curled tips. That will take it in a brushy direction and help make those forms more unique.  \n\\* \"s\" is interesting but I need to see it in use, as part of a word or two, before making any decisions.\n\nIf you want to turn it into a real font there is a free font making program listed somewhere in the Typowiki.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

I've been away travelling for a few weeks and only just got back here a day ago, so you're hardly late responding.\n\nTo get some clues about brush dynamics and features, spend a while looking at art brush scripts. Art & Sign fonts, and Letterhead Fonts, make some of the best examples around. My idea is to make your design more specific, and a brush grotesk seems a natural direction to go from this point. A brush grotesk would also be more unique than a typographic grotesk\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Though I will offer some constructive criticism which I am only too happy to be taken with a very large grain of salt. (In fact I offer this as an opportunity for myself to learn also and look forward to finding out if I am seeing things that are viewed differently by the experts.)\n\nLet me begin by saying I really like the feeling that this typeface exudes, its got a great energy and seems like fun!\n\nLooking at the face as it stands I feel that perhaps the 'a', 'g', and 'e' seem to have a slightly different vertical axis than the rest of the face. These three glyphs feel as though they are 'falling' to the left a little more than the others which lean toward the right.\n\nShould the counter of the 'g' and 'e' be on a similar axis? Perhaps the 'o' also? The counter of the 'a' perhaps seems a little squished relative to the 'b' & 'd' etc?\n\nCould the space between the cross bar and counter of the 'f' be loosened?\n\nI hope some of these thoughts are useful, and look forward to seeing you progress.\n\nGood luck.  \n-nic\n\n"
