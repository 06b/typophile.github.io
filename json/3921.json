I tried to do it by myself and a canadian friend helped me too, but it's not perfect.   \n   \nBtw, the Eric de Berranger interview is only in french and it's a problem. It's a great designer and English people have to hear what he had to say !   \n   \nso, any help is needed and welcome to translations, articles, types presentation, artworks, pdf spreading etc etc...   \n   \n;) i'll do the best for the 2nd issue   \n   \n--Steph\n\n"
