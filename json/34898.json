  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI guess this ID is pretty simple for the most of you. I downloaded this font weeks or months ago somewhere on the net , but somehow I can't remember the URL/foundry anymore. I already searched on [Maniacker's](http://web.archive.org/web/20101209155421/http:/www2.wind.ne.jp/maniackers/designfont.html) and [Bureau Destruct's](http://web.archive.org/web/20101209155421/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/www.burodestruct.net) site (which came first into my mind when I saw this font) but didn't have any luck with it. Argh...\n\nAny ideas?  \nMany thanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [wtf.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20101209155421/http:/typophile.com/files/wtf_5.gif) | 1.39 KB |\n\n",
