I would rather get [National](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203163322/http:/www.vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/) instead of Stag sans. On the type tester, it seems like they would work well together, but I would love your opinions.\n\nIs Stag/National a go or a no?\n\nSharon\n\n [‹ Link into a word](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203163322/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46194 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Subliminal Marlboro logo on F1 car ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203163322/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46193 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
