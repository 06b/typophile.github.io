I’ve never been very clear about whether the appendices, including the layout feature tags and descriptions, were considered normative or informative. Some seem obviously informative, e.g. the WGL4 character set and the ’TrueType fundamentals’ appendix. But others seem at least quasi-normative unless one takes the view that OpenType Layout is an implementation of the spec rather than part of the format (which seems a legitimate view: I’m just not sure how MS and Adobe view OTL).\n\n"
