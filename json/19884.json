  "content": "Hello,  \n I’m currently working on a comic book and  \ndoing my own lettering by hand. I’d like to create my own font, using  \nmy own lettering (by hand, all caps), so when I type out my stories on  \nthe computer, I could print it out in my personalized font. I was  \nhoping I could write out the alphabet ten times, so when I type out my  \nfont it would randomly select a different letter “A”, so as not to  \nlook too uniform, and more hand drawn. (i.e.: aaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbb  \ncccccccccc...etc.) Does this make sense? Is there any solution to this ?  \nI would really appreciate some advice.  \nThanks.\n\n [‹ Problems with wsuperior on PC](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109095913/http:/typophile.com/node/19784 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [programming fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109095913/http:/typophile.com/node/19653 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
