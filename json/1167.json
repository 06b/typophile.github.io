Versions/clones from defunct foundries are out there as well.   \n   \nArt Gothic appears in the Victorian section of the Solotype Catalog.   \n   \nStephen, I'm sure that you are correct, but I'm left wondering about a few things then:\n\n> 1. Did metal type not contain alternate characters in a set? I know nothing about this, but noted that just the small sampling of Art Gothic in the Solotype Catalog contains two very different 'e's.  \n  \n> 2. Could printing methods account for some of those variations, especially varying stroke weights?  \n  \n> 3. When we see old type samplings (like Jared's apparently) that seem to mimic very old tyepfaces .... I don't know ... I guess this isn't a question. I'm just trying to picture what actually was being done. A lettering artist sitting and copying a printed sample next to him/her? With those handwritten variations we note � some clearly intentional. I suppose this makes sense if it was the case  \nI have a special interest in this area, because I love to go through the old greeting card and postcard bins in antique stores (in which I'd otherwise be bored to death while my wife does extended browsing). Every once in awhile I find lettering that I think is quite unique and potentially modern-day useful.   \n  \n   \n  \n\n"

I gather that individual letters of a typeface still had to be physically placed in a machine � unless I misunderstood).\"   \n   \nIt sounds to me that perhaps you do misunderstand the photolettering technique. I knew someone who had a filmsetting machine and the only type he used was on a photographically -produced optical disc. There was no actual, physical type, just a round glass plate with letters on it (I think the plate was black and the letters were clear, but I am not sure if I recall this properly). Your typing rotated the disc to select the character image and then 'printed' it photographically on another strip of film, I think. This could further be tweaked and kerned to produce a final piece of film or photographic plate that was used to print the copy, or more usually headlines. I admit some of this explanation involves a bit of shaky memory, and an attempt to guess at the whole process, since I only saw a brief demonstration of this expensive piece of equipment when my friend first began his own printshop. This was well over 10 years ago, so may have been an investment that he regretted a few years later when digital equipment became much more common. I think photolettering is still used in limited applications, especially for personal stationery and wedding invitations, etc.   \n   \nI looked at the conversation you linked, which was principally about the use of letterpress, and saw only one or two references to the use of film, but the point about the clarity of the character images (and presumably the typography) being more important than the printing methodology is certainly unassailable.\n\n"

Thanks for that clarification Mike.   \n   \nIn the little info I found online, I clearly had made some false assumptions and linked bits of info incorrectly.   \n   \nYour explanation of photolettering makes some of the comments in the Solotype Catalog, especially about tweaking jobs optically, make more sense now.   \n   \nAgain, I'm going to see what the library has to offer. Images of equipment and technique would be informative and fun for me to see.\n\n"
