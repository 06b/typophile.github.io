But when I load up mine, somehow the distance is greater than what you have. I loaded up Photoshop and compared what we both have, and mine's off by a pixel. Strange. (And that WA is a bit wide, I think)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023152109im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Warnock_5841.jpg)\n\nMy overshoots got cut off due to bad copy-paste. Haha :)\n\n"

      "content": "The figures Florian shows indicate that this series seems thoughtfully kerned.\n\nAnd going beyond what Nick said I said. I think the word \"WARNOCK\" sets perfectly at 72 pt. with one kern. All spacing and all pair kerning is based on the theory of making _all_ combinations not absolutely fail. Failure in a Sans is maybe .5 to 1, and in Serif 2-3, manual kerns per 7-8 letters? Near this example, e.g. the word \"WARLACK\" might not have a \"WA\" to kern at all? Or that's what we hope.\n\n\"...My overshoots got cut off due to bad copy-paste. Haha :)\"  \n...and your 'ar' is tighter than his while your 'no' is looser than his, haha :y  \nMaybe try setting \"WARLOCK\", lighting 13 candles and zapping your computer's pram ;#\n\nCheers!\n\n"
