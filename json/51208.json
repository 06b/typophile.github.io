  "content": "Hi,  \nWhat do most people do when filling in the 'TrueType Vendor Code' field in the 'Basic Font Identification' setting of FontLab.\n\nShould a one-man foundry register with Microsoft or Apple?  \n(Love to here comments and views from the normal Joe and the Microsoft guys on this)\n\nOr do you, as the manual says,  \n_\"...identify yourself without registering you may enter a lowercase four-letter vendor code.\"_\n\nIs there a blank default setting, or are you bound to put something....like Pyrus?\n\nThanks in advance  \nDrj\n\n",

If you don't want to register an ID I'd suggest leaving it blank.\n\n"
