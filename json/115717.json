The store is Cigarette Store in Tampere and every time I walk past that logo, I keep wondering of those fonts. Especially letter \"K\" in the third row. I'm designer myself and this is really disturbing that I can't identify those fonts. :D\n\nSo, can you help me? I'm looking for both fonts.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n caxton book, cloister open face \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317133511/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
