They're constantly reinventing their typefaces (Matrix II) because I think they realize this. Licko, Keedy, etc. were some of the first good type designers on the digital platform, and thusly did a lot of experimentation. So I think their type shows a sort of progression through the late 80s to now. I guess my answer is yes, some do look dated, but I would count on them constantly updating and adding new, more contemporary faces. I wouldn't be surprised to look back at any foundry's work ten years from now and think the same thing. I still personally enjoy the italics for triplex as well as the caps. Those curves on the stems of the lowercase really bug me though.\n\nI remember seeing Citizen on the cover for the movie [Black Hawk Down](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123061338/http:/www.impawards.com/2001/posters/black_hawk_down_ver1.jpg).\n\n"

Sometimes I use the Brody stuff from that era, but the wacky Emigre types are just horrid. Like the magazine they did a great job of inspiring importan discourse about typography, but like the magazine, no sane person wants to try reading them today.\n\n"

I'm a huge Emigre fanboy (proud owner of an Emigre tshirt-in Dogma no less), but that doesn't mean we can't offer some criticism. I prefer to think of Emigre's types as fashionable. Imagine what the clothes from high-fashion designers from Paris, Milan and New York were making in the late 80s and early 90s. Emigre was kind of the place where typefaces were rethought, and the result was a lot of experimental type designs. Some were successful in the short run, some not at all, and some that I don't think that I could work without. I'm actually starting to lean towards Mrs Eaves being sort of fad-y.\n\n_Hype has a negative connotation._  \nSometimes, yes. Emigre was hyped and criticized. What David is saying is nothing new.

You think i'm wrong? well, cooper black was \"top of the hype\" in 1968, and it was the synonym of cheap in 2000. brody was \"top of the hype\" in 1987, and you can hardly find one of his types in use today. 90% of aldo novarese's types are unavailable on a digital format today, because nobody wants them; even though he was a great artist, his types were so much used in the sixties and seventies that they are now \"paying the price\". it's very sad, yes; it is as sad as admitting that it's hard for me today to use typefaces i really, really loved, such as dogma or triplex, but it's a fact.\n\n- who can actually use these types today: that was a question, you know.

Yes I do agree that some of their faces are EXTREMELY dated..but there are others that I use regularly.\n\nA rundown:\n\nMrs Eaves - still good for some things, just not setting lots of type in!  \nTribute - Used it recently for an Order of service, turned out quite nice.  \nMissionary - technically useless but appeared here and there as fillers in the now(sadly) defunct Blueprint (Martha Stewart magazines)  \nBrothers - still see it on and off...definitely one I keep  \nBase Nine - seriously, it's not that bad..but must be used sparingly  \nSolex - somehow reminds of Heinze Ketchup. Decent condensed sans.  \nMalaga - don't have it but lust after it anyways!  \nVista - Not bad either... but many sans look like this too:(  \nDalliance - IDEA mag used it for the first few pages of their issue on Book Design in China. Very well used/put together.  \nCholla - I bet it still has uses out there..don't have it so I can't say.  \nFilosofia - seen books set in this, might be a bit too much in novels but I used it for setting a coffee table book.  \nPriori - dare I say this? I'm using it now for headers in a cookbook(on CHINESE food mind you) but it works. Gill would have been too boring, the quirky-ness helps that little bit!\n\nThe rest.. sorry. I doubt it..but you never know?\n\nI wouldn't write them off completely. They've definitely produced a bunch of gems, and some duds of course, but which foundry hasn't? When I was in design school I thought the world of Emigre and it's catalogues!\n\n"
