  "content": "Hello Typophiles,\n\nWe have numerous enquiries from customers who are using old style Helvetica. They in turn are then advised by their design agency's to use Neue Helvetica instead, but then they always ask the question about what are the differences? I am sure to the untrained eye the fonts do look very similar, but I am hoping that the Typographic community here can expand further.\n\nWhat I am particularly interested in is\n\nDifference in character shapes  \nAny difference in kerning  \nAny pro's/cons of upgrading to Neue Helvetica.\n\nI have searched the web for answers, but I would feel more confident in the information that I can receive here.\n\nI thank you for your time.\n\nKind regards  \nNeil\n\n",

      "content": "Neil,\n\nOne of the big differences is that whereas the various weights of Helvetica were drawn by different type designers at different times, Helevetica Neue was conceived as a large family from the get-go (it also has more weights than Helvetica), and has consistent variations from one weight to the next. The series of weights are named and organized in a manner similar to the Univers family; that is, using two-digit numbers (i.e., 55=Roman, 65=Medium, 75=Bold, etc. Numbers ending in 5 are upright weights; those ending in 6 are Italics; numbers ending in 7 are Condensed; numbers ending in 3 are Extended).\n\nMore info here...  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311084258/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/\")\n\n...and here:  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311084258/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica\")\n\n"
