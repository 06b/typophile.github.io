  "content": "Hey, I know I'm new to Typophile but, I was wondering if anybody else was having a problem with the web site lately?  \nI just found Typophile about 4 weeks ago and while I lurked for a week I didn't have any problems loading the site whenever I wanted.  \nThe first week after I signed up for membership I didn't have any trouble.  \nExcept for only one day last week, I have had nothing but problems loading and navigating the Typophile web site.  \nI keep getting time out messages saying something about site availability or that it may be down for maintenance.  \nIs this the case or is it all on my end?  \nI know my computer is not the newest but, I never have trouble like this anywhere else I go.  \nI was assuming it was google trying to punish me for not switching to crome....  \nEither way it is getting irritating to say the least.  \nAny thoughts?  \nThanks.  \nMerl\n\n",
