I keep reworking the baseline grid but am fielding a continual stream of size and leading changes that are ongoing so I suspect it will all be reworked a few more times.\n\nAnd please do feel free to comment about the small caps as well.\n\n"

      "content": "Aside from the kerning issue—which should be dealt with—a more important one is to show a more clear hierarchy. Everything being close to the same size and color makes it less accessible and compelling. I would say: decide on three things that are most important, and make these bigger, and make the others help in a subordinate role. Then the subordinate ones you can play with your typographic tool kit to get the right balance.\n\nFor example, the treatment of ’save the date’ doesn’t seem to have the right emotional tone. It is surrounded with something flowery, and in the same script as the name of the dinner. The emotional appeal should be in the title, I would think, and “save the date” maybe tacked on in a bold sans, maybe asymmetrically or at an angle as a matter of fact advisory. Then the later notice can be the same design without the ’save the date’ notice.\n\n"

By the time we get to the progam there will be more text laden with acronyms.\n\nWilliam, I’m still in the phase of following the client’s request on size and emphasis where I need to comply first then seduce them into something better. In my mind the date needs to be prominent as it is the primary piece of information, yet the style is to minimize this. The client wants the receipients’ names large—as large as the name of the event. So I’ll continue to work with it.\n\n"

      "content": "I think you will find that if you set the type just a bit smaller, you can accommodate much of the advice (good stuff) you’ve been given. The size of space is every bit as important as the size of the type.\n\nIf you use the natural, unkerned space between, say, “R” and “Y” as the proper amount, then “kern” everything else (looser) to match that spacing, you’ll be on a good track.\n\nOne general use of small caps is to not visually break up a line of type with so many full caps. But when each word begins with a cap (as with a name), you have already broken the line — or, if you prefer, established a new rhythm. Personally, I would set the “III” in full caps, and that will mean that M.D. too should be in full caps.\n\nFWIW\n\n"

Not completely, but just enough to peer through your lashes. Single letters, words and lines dissolve into cloudlike shapes. That will allow you to consider the allover colour of the piece. And you’ll be able to see where blocks of matter are uneven or too close to each other. It even helps to hold the piece upsidedown.\n\nBTW: It’s almost impossible to review something on screen. I would need a highres print.\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"
