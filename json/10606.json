I don't remember the actual percentage condensed. But that damn spur on the G must have been customized. Also, I saw this style guide back in 1993, and I believe the switched to a Didot face a few years ago, especially since Fabien Baron (ex Harpers Bazaar art director and Didot fan) does a lot of graphics work for them. My personal belief is that they now use a customized version of Didot for the logo and HTF Didot for their sub-brand names, like \"armani mania\" perfume, which you can tell by looking at the lowercase a.\n\n"
