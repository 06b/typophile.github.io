Be brutal -- I want   \nto learn!   \n   \nI wasn't entirely sure whether to post this here or in the display   \nsection, since I only really intended it to be used in large sizes.   \nA couple of people have told me they like it in smaller sizes, but   \nI think it's too heavy. I may make a lighter (and better spaced   \nfor text) weight if this one turns out OK.   \n   \nThanks in advance,   \n   \nJordan   \n   \n ![Lowercase only I'm afraid](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417101259im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21589.gif)   \n ![Sample words](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417101259im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21590.gif)   \n ![Sample sizes](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417101259im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21591.gif)\n\n",
