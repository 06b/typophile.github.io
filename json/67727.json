  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nis there a way to automatically set L/R/LR kern class flags according to the name using Python?  \nI'm importing a .ufo back into FontLab, but since .ufo doesn't support the flags the kern classes are unflagged, and I have to manually re-import the kern class files.\n\nOr, in other words: How do I manipulate kern classes of FL font objects anyway?  \nOnly thing I could find is f.classes, which gives a list of classes and members, which is probably editable. But what about the flags?\n\nThank,  \nYanone\n\n",
