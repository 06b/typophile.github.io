Would I be allowed to distribute (sell) that as a typeface?  \nI once read that the name of a typeface may be even more protected then the actual letter forms. Assuming it would be allowed to distribute the work, would it also be allowed to advertise it as \"A set of ornamental capitals for Bembo®\"?\n\n",
