  "content": "Hi all,\n\nLooking for some recommendations for a body font for promotional material I am designing for a new play. The play is a science fiction piece, with strong female central characters and feminist themes. I was looking at [Chennai](http://web.archive.org/web/20070226074230/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dooleytype/chennai/), but some of the characters dont look too well drawn to me, and I was wondering if this was a knock-off of something else, or if there is a better font available in this same vein.\n\nDoesn’t necessarily need to be sans serif, but I think sans may be best to communicate a “futuristic” feel.\n\nAll suggestions are appreciated!\n\n",

It seems to me to have a vaguely futuristic feel to it, although I’m not positive if it feels very feminine.\n\n"

However, I’m not positive if any of the typefaces that have been mentioned by Lex and I would be terrific for extended reading, though they might be fine for your short promotional text.\n\nEdit: Forgot the link to [Triplex Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20070226074230/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/triplex-italic/) — otherwise you might have thought Triplex was italic-less.\n\n"
