I found some usefull stuff on youtube, but i need more before i can continue.\n\ndoes anyone know if there are better tutorials that provide a little more depth?\n\nfor instance with class kerning and metrics (i'm allergic to code, but this looks doable), is anyone actually using that? Cause it looks like a great way to get the basics right, but i'm not sure if i will be able to undo it without ruining what i did so far.\n\nsome help please\n\n",

I found it useful for myself. The are also some videos on OpenType ligatures on the same Vimeo channel.\n\n<cite>\"i'm not sure if i will be able to undo it without ruining what i did so far\"</cite>  \nIn that case just make a copy of your .vfb file and work with that until you're confident to go back to your original file. That's what I do, especially when I'm trialling out something new.\n\nDomenico.\n\n"
