  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nFor my masterproject i’m writing about the conflict of academic - professional designers.  \nI want to work for this thesis around the book - Twenty-two things you should never do with typefaces - by Enric Jardi.  \nFor every rule he tels not to do, i want to prove that it can be done, because type is more than rules, it’s about a feeling, you cant just say how to become good type… atleast not in a radical way…\n\nThe first thing i want to bring up is the following:\n\n“Avoid script, Letters that look like handwriting can be a nice decorative resource, but they are not exactly typefaces”.  \nThis is rule Nr. 8 in the book\n\nI want to prove that you can use script letters properly, so now my question is, can you guys give me good examples of the correct use of script letters, or is this rule correct? Shouldn’t you use them? What are good script letters and are there well-known designers who use them frequently?\n\nI realy hope this brings a discussion alive, because it would help me very much and i would use all the text in my project that is posted here.\n\nBest regards,\n\nOlivier\n\n [‹ World's Smallest Letters](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192350/http:/typophile.com/node/50622 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Could this be Adobe's Gauge? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192350/http:/typophile.com/node/50631 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Unless I’m an expert at self-hypnosis, my Agenda, which is conscious, I doubt could have had such a visceral effect. Essentially, my anti-chirographic stance comes just as much from the depths of my being as it does from the (contextual) heights of my thought.  \n2) It was Palatino Italic’s physical presence on the rectangular face of a stick of metal that I found “fraudulent”. Palatino -especially the Roman- as an abstact design itself is perhaps less offensive to me. That said, even if I think any font has its place, I don’t personally believe Palatino is something to be emulated, especially not today.  \n3) Whatever “impact Palatino had when it was released” is not relevant to my stance, and certainly not my anecdote.

I would imagine he’s a proponent of the philosophy that “you need to know the rules before you can break them,” which I happen to agree with.\n\nThe worst that could happen, if let’s say a design student really takes his list to heart and lives by the rules their whole career, is that they produce safe design. It’s probably boring uninspired work most of the time, but at least the world is safe from their terrible experimentation, and most of what they produce will at least be “effective,” in the sense that it will look like professional work\n\nThe best situation is if they learn the rules, try to follow them, but then figure out on their own after a few months or years that there are a whole lot of exceptions to the rules. Personally, memorable learning moments for me have been when I see something I was taught was true is not always true, or is flat out false.\n\nI think the most common situation, however, is for people to totally disregard the rules just because they are called rules, and they don’t want to design according to set parameters — they want to reinvent the wheel, be the next David Carson. It would be much worse to learn the rules and abide by them your whole life, to be sure. But I think most people spend a lot of time trying to be totally original, and not not enough time absorbing influences and then naturally evolving that into their own voice.\n\nOf course, you need to really believe that the rules are “The Rules” in the beginning, otherwise you’re not going to take them seriously.\n\n"

But starting with the assumption that any rule must be false is stupid too.\n\nFor example, reading text is not just a matter of habit; the human eye and brain prefer certain things, like type that’s within a certain size range. Similarly, if you assume that a typeface designer has made his curves just so, blindly compressing/extending type is unintelligent and unwise.

Some people do it through strict rules, some people do it through having a rule about no rules or trying to break the rules, and most of use a combination of conventions with our own personal spin.\n\nMy feeling is that the people who really stand out are those who go to polar extremes — for instance in the Helvectica documentary, they interview people like Massimo Vignelli and Stefan Sagmeister. They don’t interview Joe or Jane Designer who does some pretty nice annual reports, and gets a few things in the annuals every year.\n\nThe question of “is there one approach, regarding the adherence to, rejection of, or finding some middle ground in terms of rules, that produces good design?” is a much more interesting question to me. My guess is that all hinges if you’re looking for regularity — people who adhere to rules are going to produce design that is more predictably good than those who are wildly experimental. The wildly experimental person is going to maybe produce a lot of failures, but a few incredibly memorable things as well. But that’s just my guess.\n\n"
