  "content": "I am updating an identity for my branding, design firm and I have recommended a switch in our corporate typeface. I am looking for a few suggestions which fit our criteria:\n\n- capture the openness and friendliness of our current face (Century Gothic)\n- with a more credible font that sets well and is part of a larger system (similar to Helvetica Neue, which some designers would like to see used)\n- this larger system should include different weights, a nice italic, an expanded character set and solid numerals (distinct or non-lining figures would be a nice plus)\n- we are also probably setting our name as a word-mark or initialed in this face, so it must have enough personality (or brand) to sit on its own\n\nSome designs that came to mind were: Verlag, Scala (both families), Dax, Neo Sans, Gotham, Whitney, or even Apex Sans and Galaxie Polaris.\n\nI know I've seen excellent suggestions on these boards. What do you guys think?\n\nThanks in advance for any help,\n\nSam\n\n",

The numbers really are wonderful, though.\n\nOverall, are there any picks that are a little safer, more friendly?\n\nTo me, Verlag was just nice, with a little character. The x-height makes it a little conspicuous and I think that keeps it from being perfect for our goals. The personality and sophistication, though, are right on.\n\n"

      "content": "Verlag is a great typeface. I have had the opportunity to work with it and found it works very well at small sizes. However, because it is a geometric it will have moments of feeling stiff. The italic, for instance, isn't a soft as you might find in something else. But, on the other hand, your color palette, visuals, and other tactile elements will go a long way into imparting friendliness across the brand.\n\n"

We're considering a face called [Evo BQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415124707/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/evo-bq/), which has an ampersand that almost takes the font out of contention.
