  "content": "Hello Typophiles  \nIm after a similar logo to eye magazine. I’m guessing it’s an original hand edited creation. But is there anything similar? I love the curve of the ’e’s and I’m looking for looping ’L’s and ’o’s like in the Kelloggs logo.\n\nIt’s for my refreshed business logo (hence the change life part) :)\n\nThanks very much\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415135133im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/eye_5592.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415135133im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/kellogs_3818.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Hazlitz Bespoke Stationery striped sans - Prisma (Mirage) {Michael Albright (Rainer)}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415135133/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32803 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Toyota Aurion font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415135133/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32796 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
