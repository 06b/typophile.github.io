  "content": "The Most Unwanted Song, is mesmerizing: over an accompaniment of bagpipe, tuba and accordian (statistically, America’s least favorite instruments), an operatic soprano (our least favorite type of singer) raps (ditto) about cowboys (ditto). Vitaly Komar and Alex Melamid’s research indicated that the most hated lyrical subject is holidays (disliked by 33%), so the song is suitable not only for Christmas, but Easter, Labor Day, Veterans’ Day, and Halloween. These interludes are introduced abruptly by a children’s chorus (“Hey everybody, it’s Yom Kippur!”), who couple their refrains with cheerful commercial messages. By the end, the subject has shifted to human slavery and genocide. The whole thing, going on for nearly 22 minutes (the least favorite song length), is as impossible to ignore as a car crash.\n\n[http://ubu.artmob.ca/sound/komar\\_melamid/KomarMelamid\\_The-Most-UnwantedS...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015032243/http:/ubu.artmob.ca/sound/komar_melamid/KomarMelamid_The-Most-UnwantedSong.mp3 \"http://ubu.artmob.ca/sound/komar\\_melamid/KomarMelamid\\_The-Most-UnwantedSong.mp3\")\n\n",

That is the way bagpipes are supposed to be heard, like when they pipe at the castle in Edinburgh at sunset.\n\nTuba - well - yes although I love it.\n\nSame with operatic soprano.\n\nRaps and cowboys? Rap and country music so far outsells rock these days that it isn't even close.\n\nHolidays?
