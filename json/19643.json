If anyone has any recommendations of resources to check out, they are very welcome and appreciated. I’ll be documenting most of what I’m reading on my site (it’s in my profile if anyone wants to look... I didn’t add the link here to avoid spamming).  \nThanks for any advice you’re willing to share.  \n-Casey\n\n [‹ Mercury Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806220157/http:/typophile.com/node/19662 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Belgrade Design Week ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806220157/http:/typophile.com/node/19289 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
