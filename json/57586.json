  "content": "I'm working on a guitar inlay that has 10 large letters across the fingerboard. The client wants a blackletter similar to Letraset's \"Old English\" but what they provided as their concept sketch is squooshed down to fit the shape of the fingerboard.\n\nLots of the blackletter fonts naturally have a more condensed look to them, are there any that are more extended in their native form? I'd like to get them the look they are after, but without some horrible scaling. Any leads?\n\n",

      "content": "[New English](http://web.archive.org/web/20130203204731/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/newenglish.shtml) at Lettherhead looks interesting, Paul, but it's a little more condensed that I was hoping to start with. LHF's [Hindlewood](http://web.archive.org/web/20130203204731/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/hindlewood.shtml) and [Divine](http://web.archive.org/web/20130203204731/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/divine.shtml) are also cool. Good for my shopping list but not this project.\n\nStephen, Engraver's Olde English Bold will work well! I will still be forced to squish it a little, but since I'm redrawing it and reducing the contrast a little (thin lines are too thin to cut from mother of pearl without breaking), hopefully it won't look squished when I'm done.\n\nShame I can't use the Storm Moyenage. It's exactly the legibility that precludes it from this project. Another one for the shopping list.\n\nThanks for the help, everyone. I will post pics when the project is done, and if I'm allowed by the client, I'll post some of the design before we cut the letters.\n\n"
