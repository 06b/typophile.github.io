  "content": "I have a collection of about 2000 one inch photolettering film strips. About half are in nice wooden storage racks, the rest are in plastic storage boxes.\n\nThe designs are mostly common typefaces (Helvetica, Univers, ITC etc) but there are a few gems in there as well.\n\nThey have been stored in a store cupboard in the office that we use – free from damp and frost, but now they have to go! I am willing to give them to a good home (yes give!)- anyone who wants to come and pick them up is welcome to them.\n\nWe cannot ship them anywhere, if you would like them you must come and pick up, and you will need a small van and a bit of muscle to do so.\n\nIf you want any further information please drop me an email:  \nMwooden at dtptypes dot com\n\nThanks  \nMalcolm\n\n [‹ Exhibition Type - Vinyl Cut Help](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011134313/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33467 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Extra-slanty italics introduced for extremely important words ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011134313/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33502 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
