      "content": "This scan has me thinking about the principles which guide my approach to type design. By most measures it could be said this face is inconsistent and awkward. My instincts say, the e/u are way to narrow -- except for the é which is better -- and the h/n are from different planets. Thus begins the process of ironing out all the quirks, stripping the life from (my) type. Case in point, I always hated Weiss. It's so campy amateur in its details (see the s). But now it’s growing on me in a Frank Heine Tribute kind of way. Certainly there is a balance to be found between quirkable and workable, especially for text. But I am inspired to crank the dial a few notches back toward quirky.\n\nAnyhoo, I have no idea what this type is. It is both bizarre and beautiful. Thanks for posting.\n\n"
