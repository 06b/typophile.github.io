      "content": "Good point, of course. Yeah, 1957 was their last season in Brooklyn (same for N.Y. Giants). As a New Yorker until 1970, this would be sharp in my mind.   \n   \nOf course, that is assuming the Brooklyn lettering was truly authentic. Brush Script, mentioned by Yves for that one t-shirt, was designed in 1942, so at least it's plausible as a model. I have a book showing Topps baseball cards back to 1951. The only wording I see on the baseball jerseys on the cards seems to be Dodgers, but the road jerseys might have said Brooklyn. (I found a Dodgers web site describing the uniforms and between 1937 and 1957 the road uniforms said Brooklyn 'in the same script' as the word Dodgers. Dodgers is NOT Brush Script. See this [photo of Roy Campanella's jersey from 1954](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712081521/http:/www.huntauctions.com/online/imageviewer.cfm?auction_num=19&lot_num=867&lot_qual=&url_referer=view_lots_items_list.cfm). It seems likley that this lettering was drawn and traced, and cut out of fabric completely by hand.\n\n"
