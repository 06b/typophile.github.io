  "content": "Let me begin by saying that I am no pirate. I am actually so vocal on the subject that I have on occasion bullied others. So, it is with that said that I must voice my current predicament. I truly hope that within that context, there is some sort of resolution.\n\nSometime in the spring of last year, I was taken with a beautiful font that frequented the ID forum on some book covers: ITC Didi.\n\nUnfortunately, (not to rehash the facts) Didi was digitized by Image Club Graphics in the late 80's-early 90's, but was later discontinued. So, I let my crush on the beautiful but unattainable Didi fade. In the company of other type dorks, I would sometimes mention this star-crossed font, waxing poetic about what might have been. \\*le sigh\\*\n\nI was moving on in my life, still giddy with my recent purchase of Archer, when an acquaintance of mine brought up my old flame. In fact, she emailed me the object of my desire; the actual file for Didi. I have opened it, and studied the glyphs. However, I feel like this is somehow worse. Before, it was simply out of reach. Now, it is within reach, but only on the \"dl\".\n\nHow could I possibly ever use this? I am sure that the file in question was attained through dubious means. I would be willing to pay for the rights to actually use it, but how would I go about broaching that subject? Is what I propose even possible?\n\nAs an ex smoker, I compare this to having a cigarette and no means by which to light it.\n\nShould I delete this file and forget I ever had it?\n\n",

The previous designer (now serving time in Wormwood Scrubs for unrelated crimes) provided all the files, but as an upstanding citizen you'd like to know where to send the check to cover the license fee for the font.\n\n"

But yes if you have the font file in your possession, and you want to pay for it most font vendors large or small would appreciate you wanting to do the right thing, and work out something for you if contractually they are able to. Elaborate tales as to how you got the font and how much you need it to do your job can't hurt.\n\n"
