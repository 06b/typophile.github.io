  "content": "Generally, I'm interested in typography. Professionally, I'm a software programmer. Privately, I am, among (a few) other things, a lover of design with typography near the top of the list of favorite design disciplines. I'd been searching for a specific book for the better part of a year, when a friend suggested I look for a forum discussing typography to ask experts and enthusiasts my question:   \n   \nIs there such a book (or, hopefully, books) which look at:   \n   \n- How cultural, social, economic, political trends have impacted the use of existing typefaces and design of new typefaces, and   \n- Conversely, how uses of existing and new typefaces have, through the course of history, affected communication and expression, and impacted greater cultural, social, economic, political trends?   \n   \nMy interest is pretty broad: a historical account, a contemporary analysis, theory. I'd be interested in a couple of other related topics, such as the crosstalk between typography and other design disciplines, or at what time and in which contexts were specific design elements and forms in specific glyphs or whole typefaces introduced.   \n   \nA rather broad description. Any hits in the vicinity would be appreciated, as is your patience to simply read this post.   \n   \nMuch thanks,   \nKLS\n\n",

      "content": "Here's another:   \nThe Visible Word : Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923, by Johanna Drucker   \n   \nI was reminded of it by Armin's post -- like Heller, Drucker attaches great importance to the publications of early 20th C art movements. She also argues that the integration of text into (some) modern art which occurred at that time subsequently went missing, with the unfortunate result that Post WW2 modernism, especially the NY school, slipped into a polarized void, with critics supplying all the words, and the art becoming a dumb, shallow, conceptual second fiddle.   \nAnyway, that's how I remember the book from reading it a few years ago, so she might actually have said something quite different.\n\n"
