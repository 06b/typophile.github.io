[http://typophile.com/node/114087](http://web.archive.org/web/20140710052912/http:/typophile.com/node/114087 \"http://typophile.com/node/114087\") ...coolio! It is the very first type I have ever been fortunate enough to hold in my hands ... and own, even if it is just one character lol.\n\nI have a few questions... Is there a way to tell the date when these characters were cut? And how were they so precisely routered? And what type of wood was generally used? And, which foundry produced this particular set? Are there foundry marking stamped on a particular character's base?\n\nMuch thanks in advance!\n\n",
