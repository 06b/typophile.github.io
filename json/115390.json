For those who have tried it, can you give us your comments. Also, It seems possible to installed it on MAC OSX, however after a few inconclusive tests, I failed. Your help would be useful to help me to installed it. Thanks!\n\n",

They are important.  \nTry with a few different options to see what they do, and test results in a PC\n\nCheers,  \nPablo\n\n"
