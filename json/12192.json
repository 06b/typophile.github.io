Does the initial post/topic have to be so HUGE???\n\n2. Links seem to open automatically in the same window - is there a way to set the preference so that they automatically open a new browser window? Also in the html formatting guide I don’t see a way to do this.\n\n3. Can the FAQ anchor to the top like the Fontshop note?\n\nIf this isn’t the right place to post this I’m sorry but I don’t know who to direct this to…\n\n",
