  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help on this one. The image below is no later than 1971 or 1972. The type looks very much like Univers 65 Bold, yet it is a bit more condensed, but not to the extreme of Univers Condensed. It has a more rounded condensation. (I'm looking at the S and G).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020110151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/underground3.jpg)\n\nAnybody have ideas as to what this can be?\n\n",
