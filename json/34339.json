I've made a monotype font (for the receipt look) with Japanese inspired characters... Kind of what I imagine a receipt in Tokyo might look like ;-)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [GoTokyo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121025/http:/typophile.com/files/GoTokyo.gif) | 6.73 KB |\n| [TXTexample.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121025/http:/typophile.com/files/TXTexample.gif) | 10.5 KB |\n| [Foreign\\_Receipts.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121025/http:/typophile.com/files/Foreign_Receipts.gif) | 42.36 KB |\n| [Last\\_one\\_I\\_promise.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121025/http:/typophile.com/files/Last_one_I_promise.gif) | 10.59 KB |\n| [OK\\_so\\_I\\_lied.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121025/http:/typophile.com/files/OK_so_I_lied.gif) | 10.7 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "In order to get a receipt, you need to buy something first ;-p  \nBut since I don't really have anything to sell, I made a few pangrams for you to see the font in use.  \nHope it's still legible...  \nThe trickiest letter was probably the M since I was working on a grid of 4x5 and had to figure out a way to include the middle vertex (for the W, I just flipped the M for my own convenience). The I was also a bit of a challenge getting it wide enough, but I like the floating dot at the left (which -again- i redid for the J, except this time at the right side)... It gives it an extra Japanese feel & remains monospaced.\n\n"

      "content": "After the Japanese receipt font, I figured I should do a regular one as well. Now I've ended up with 4 receipt fonts (each of which has 3 variations; a full version, a dotted version & a pixel version). Since the numbers & symbols are quite universal, I've used the same ones for each font & for the same reason (and a little laziness on my behalf maybe) I've also reused certain characters for different fonts (how much can you really do with a 4 by 5 pixel limit anyway?). I still think I've managed to capture the characteristics of the foreign alphabets for each font, but as a test I'll leave it up to you to name them ;-)  \nBTW, I àm aware of the fact that the regular M looks a lot like an N, but once set in text, it actually seems to read as an M (trust me, I was as surprised as you are ;-p )\n\n"

      "content": "OK, I've added another alphabet, but I had ligitimate reasons to do so. I was playing around with the different fonts & put them all on top of eachother with transparancy. This gives a really cool effect, so I wanted to do the same with colours... The obvious choice for my colour range was CMY & RGB, but for that I was one alphabet short. I could've just left one colour out ofcourse, but I just couldn't decide which one plus this has been a really fun thing to do, making foreign receipts within the parameters of a 4x5 pixel limit. I'd actually like to do some more, but so far the only alphabet I can think of still doing is Arabic which would give me problems making it look that way. Arabic script is very stretched & with a 4 pixel width limit (of which you need at least 3 pixels to make a letter recognisable) there's not much left to stretch ;-)  \nAny suggestions for strange alphabets are welcome ofcourse. The ones I've got so far (in case it's hard to tell) are: a regular one, Japanese, Greek, Russian, Indian & Celtic.\n\n"

I've made quite a few changes by now, but since I'm working on an antique computer (OS 9.1, go figure) I can no longer upload images on Typophile since they've upgraded... I àm however collecting a bunch of stuff to post here on an USB-stick & am planning to post it on a friend's computer one of these days. So keep your eyes open ;-)  \nIt makes a really cool effect when using all different DBTT-typefaces in different colours & transparancies on top of eachother. I've been quite busy lately & I've got some nice things up my sleeves that I think will get some raving responses, but I still need to find the time to get organized & a good friend who'll let me use his/her computer to upload all my new stuff. But I promise -with the risk of sounding cocky- that'll be worth the wait ;-)  \nIf you like this name, you'll proçbably also enjoy \"Hack the Pony\" which I derived from one of my favourite series \"Smack the pony\" ;-)\n\n"
