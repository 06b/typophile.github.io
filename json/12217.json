Some great sessions have been developed at zero hour that must be worked into the schedule. The complete program schedule won’t be finalized until later, but that’s normal. The complete lineup is great. There’ll be more speakers on the temp website in the next couple of days.\n\nHave no fear - there will be at least 2 weeks of early registration. We’ll move all dates appropriately once the registration system is live.\n\nSorry for any confusion, frustration, etc. People are volunteering their time, and sometimes it takes longer than anticipated to get things up and running.\n\nGuaranteed, it’s going to be a great show. Paul - I have a good feeling that we’ll see you there! Gabriel and Eric - I hope you’ll be joining us - I know you’ll enjoy the show and learn a great deal.\n\n"
