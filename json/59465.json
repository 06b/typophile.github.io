I was in the Lubalin or Rockwell range but it still not right and not really interesting enough for a logotype.\n\nI am NOT a font geek so don’t be too harsh on the lubalin :)\n\nthe letters must be in CAPS so I can really only use serif typefaces otherwise the i looks like an l.\n\n",

You could use an **I** with prominent serifs (e.g., Clarendon or Bodoni) and a contrasting font (a sans serif?) for the **A**. Or maybe you could use an **A** with vertical rather than slanted sides, to mirror the **I**?  \nAlso, is the ampersand going to be part of the logo? If so, it will be the busiest of the three characters, so choose an ampersand that doesn’t upstage the **A** and the **I**. Or see if you can use a plus sign.\n\n"
