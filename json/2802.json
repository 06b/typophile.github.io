You could, as a suggestion, make a \"more blackletter' version as a titling extra, or as an \"italic\" version. Keep us posted   \n   \nkris\n\n"

I guess what I'm getting at is that the cross bar there (which balance's the letter's color with the others) looks out of place. It you applied this to some of you other characters (maybe in the uppercase and numbers) it might feel more at home.\n\n"
