It's from the classified section of a newspaper in Florida.   \n   \nI hope I'm not missing something obvious. It doesn't match anything I have, and Identifont didn't lead me to the right one, either. Thanks!   \n   \n ![want ads](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103164639im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16105.jpg)\n\n",

Pass it on, Mateys!   \n   \n(Did you like that segue?)\n\n"
