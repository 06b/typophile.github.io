  "content": "I'm happy to announce that I've just redone [adhesiontext](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015070942/http:/typophile.com/wiki/adhesiontext) from head to toe. It has a new design, new languages, new scripts, new features, and will hopefully be easier to use. The highlight is probably the addition of Russian, which will certainly come in handy to the Cyrillic developers out there.  \nEnjoy! ;^)\n\nMiguel Sousa\n\n",
