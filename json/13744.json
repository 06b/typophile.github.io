  "content": "I designed an Armenian OTF font with some features, but when I use it in InDesign CS ME (Middle Eastern version), that also supports Arabic, the features I designed go berserk. I have ligatures: mn vn, and an ordinal rt. The mn ligature works, but the vn does not work. The rt ordinal work when you type mi and not rt. The features work fine in the non-ME version, so we can say that the problem is caused by the program not the font. Still there is the possibility that I can fix the problem within the font features, but I don’t know how. Can anyone help?\n\n [‹ Font Reserve (yikes)](http://web.archive.org/web/20071126102223/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13372 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [from Illustrator to working font. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071126102223/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13330 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
