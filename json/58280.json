The short middle arm of the E is the hardest part to match and Agenda's is a bit shorter, at least. The G chin is the only other noteworthy detail in these letters, and it is relatively low. Unfortunately this G shape is probably the most common, so it's all about the amount of closure and the proportions of the chin relative to the rest of the letter.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
