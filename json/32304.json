To purchase FontShop's Top 100 (as well as few more esoteric choices). So my question is; what is the best/cheapest way to buy the Top 100? Are their any collections that will get some of the job done at a discount?\n\n",

How else to get rid of the inventory? Far better that you build the library of what you think is truly terrific, one face at a time if need be.\n\n(shameless plug) Fontshops version is a good one, but is not the only [list of top 100 typefaces.](http://web.archive.org/web/20100719013457/http:/www.100types.com/)\n\nI think we'd be collectively much more interested to hear what your _few more esoteric choices_ are...\n\n"
