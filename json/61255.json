      "content": "You have to watch out for settings such as \"A Tale of Two Cities\".  \nIf you are going to do it for capitals, it's a good idea to substitute \"space.caps\" that is wider than the default space, in \"calt\", to improve the look of all-cap setting.\n\nI don't think it really improves colour, and can be really nasty if a typographer uses H&Js that reduce wordspace.\n\nMyriad has this feature, which is part of its really tight set. In general, it is very very slick, but it does fail occasionally, and it looks like the space hasn't been set, a typo.\n\n"

      "content": "You also need to think not just in terms of pairs, but triplets. Consider kerning \"space\" \"W\". Now consider what happens if a lower-case \"f\" precedes the space, as in \"If Westmoreland had only . . .\"\n\nI just rekerned a font where, amongst other things, the comma-quoteright kerning was so tight that the string f+comma+quoteright had the quote overprinting the terminal of the \"f\". Or another font where A+quoteright+comma was kerned so much that the comma overprinted the right arm of the \"A\". I know, none of these involve spaces; the point is to think in terms of the effect of pairs kerning in three+ letter situations.\n\n"
