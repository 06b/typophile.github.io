In fact, your settings are correct.   \n   \nAside from appearing out of order in the InDesign   \nglyphs window, I'm assuming they appear out of order   \nwhen you type as well? Can you post a screenshot of   \nthe whole font as it appears in FontLab? I'm guessing   \nyou're character assignments are out of wack.\n\n"
