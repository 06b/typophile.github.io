      "content": "There were some typefaces in the late 19th and early 20th century that were similar. Roycroft was a similar American style, with some alternate letters, including a similar ’n’. Post Oldstyle was another (used for the old Saturday Evening Post). One more called Plymouth also had a similar n, also from the turn of 19th-20th century. They are all shown in Mac McGrew’s book of “American Metal Typefaces of the 20th Century”.\n\nIf this is accurate, that the style is similar, it would put it just at the trailing edge of the Art Nouveau era.\n\nBTW, hi Andreas (Fontgrube), I haven’t run into you since ABF and comp.fonts many years ago.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
