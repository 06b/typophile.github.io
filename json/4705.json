I did a quick search and found:   \n   \nWindow Seat   \nReading the Landscape from the Air   \n\"Talk about a fresh perspective! Perched 35,000 feet in the air, Window Seat decodes the sights to be seen on any flight across North America. Broken down by region, this unusual guide features 70 aerial photographs; a fold-out map of North America showing major flight paths; profiles of each region covering its landforms, waterways, and cities; tips on spotting major sights, such as the Northern Lights, the Grand Canyon, and Disney World; tips on spotting not-so-major sights such as prisons, mines, and Interstates; and straightforward, friendly text on cloud shapes, weather patterns, the continent's history, and more.\"   \n   \nSpotting manual for air travel? Full of graphic possibilities! That's my attitude for a gift, unless they said they want such and such.\n\n"
