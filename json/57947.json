It's influenced by/derived/ripped-off from Optima, but comes in a very light weight and has a few added touches -- an Optima Titling Light, if you will. Check out the A, for example.\n\nMy guess is that this dates back to the early days of DTP, and is a digitization of someone's film/CRT version of Optima. MyFonts, Fontshop and Fonts.com (along with a general Google search) didn't turn up anything.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120717144440im_/http:/typophile.com/files/chelmsford_3728.jpg)\n\n",

The \"Q\" is arbitrarily different, too, and can still be seen on Minnesota-based QUAST Trucking vehicles. I still wince a little when I see it.\n\n"
