Obviously Typophile isn't endorcing any candidate but maybe you know some type associations (or design ones) doing any political stand or something like that ?   \nThanks.\n\n",

The reason for the looks is to appeal to the lowest common denominator (You know I'm a canadate of the people) so slick is out. There is a huge amount of marketing (and dirty tricks) that goes into politics.\n\n"
