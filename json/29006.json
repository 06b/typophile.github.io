  "content": "Ok I just moved to a really expensive part of town and I'm having trouble paying all these bills (where are they coming from and didn't I already pay that one last month??). I am employed full time and yet, they aren't paying enough. I really love my company and don't feel that leaving is an option just to pay the bills (I'd rather like who I work with).\n\nSo I'm asking anyone who has any freelance opportunities, please look at my portfolio, [www.studio513.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020203709/http:/www.studio513.net/ \"www.studio513.net\") and contact me if I can help. I really really really really really really need the work. My specialties are but not limited to publication layout and logos. Thanks!\n\nKim :)\n\nP.S. I'm located in Maryland but can work via email or phone for instructions.\n\n",
