  "content": "I'm looking to mimic the style of late 60's-early 70's Veglia Borletti automotive gauges. I remember them most fondly from a Lancia Fulvia, but Ferrari Dinos used gauges with the same font. It's been suggested that the numerals and text are not the same font, I'm not sure if that's true.\n\nI'm interested in the labels and numerals, not the small \"Veglia Borletti\" wordmark.\n\n[Fuel Gauge](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317170725/http:/www.i-firme.fr/WebRoot/ce_fr3/Shops/236444/4E30/7CDF/28D0/7901/5177/C0A8/8008/349E/jauge_essence_veglia_borletti_innocenti_mini_.JPG)  \n [Dino Speedometer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317170725/http:/www.ferraris-online.com/cars/FE-206GT-00396/images/P019Web.jpg)  \n [Fulvia Dashboard (lower resolution)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317170725/http:/www.classicitaliancarsforsale.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/22.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n EF Radiant \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [kthomps5](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317170725/http:/typophile.com/user/175823 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
