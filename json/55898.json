I love the layout of the website because it's really easy to navigate and find exactly what your looking for.\n\nI also found this website: [http://www.stumbleupon.com/toolbar/#search=design%2520websites&url=http%...](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629062417/http:/www.stumbleupon.com/toolbar/#search=design%2520websites&url=http%2525253A//www.robbianodesign.com/ \"http://www.stumbleupon.com/toolbar/#search=design%2520websites&url=http%2525253A//www.robbianodesign.com/\")  \nI came across this website on stumbleupon, and I thought it was pretty interesting when a bunch of pictures of motorcycles popped up considering I just took motorcycle classes over the weekend. I started looking at the website and I like the simplicity of it. I also like the graphics that it uses.\n\n",
