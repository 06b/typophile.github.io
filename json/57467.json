      "content": "I've just read in an interview for an catalogue (as far as the eye can see) with him that, as he started his art in the 60ties, he searched for a non-dictatorial typeface, and he ran into letters of Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed which anyone could buy in stationery stores. Than for a long time he used this type until he recognized that the people connected this type form with himself. After that time he worked with a stencil type called FF Offline, and now he designed his own typeface called: \"Margaret Seaworthy Gothic\".\n\n"
