Unorthodox design is explained away as 'experimental', often as a means of ducking criticism of the results. There is a presupposition that all experiments are successful experiments, justified entirely by their experimental nature rather than by either their goals or their results. True experimental design follows an experimental path: hypothesis, procedure, analysis.   \n   \nIf you want to see amazing experimental type design and typography, take a look at the work of the Didots and Bodoni.\n\n"

I don't have a problem with either of these terms, and they are more often accurate than 'experimental', which I think should involve an experimental process that leads from an idea to observation and conclusion (not necessarily, nor even likely, a final conclusion, but a judgement). Playing-around, exploring and experimenting are three different activities: they may overlap insofar as playing-around may have an exploratory component, or exploration may proceed from a hypothesis in the same way as experimentation, but largely they are distinct in their method and in their spirit.\n\n"

Lewis Blackwell's books about David Carson are prime examples. The same sort of thing happens when the jargon of critical theory -- itself an appropriation of scientific and pseudo-scientific terminology by way of social sciences -- is applied to graphic design: its main purpose seems to be to make designers feel important.   \n   \nWe should never underestimate the vacuity of much of the design industry, and should be wary when it starts using impressive sounding words.

But something tells me that when Brandon asks for examples of 'experimental typography' he is thinking of stuff that _looks_ experimental, i.e. novel and unorthodox. One way to clarify this would be to ask what is counter to experimental typography: presumably that which is based on known results, i.e. prior experiment or discovery. Above, I mentioned the types and typography of the Didots and Bodoni as examples of experimental typography, and if we no longer think of a block of text on a relatively narrow width, with generous leading, set in a Didot or Bodoni type as 'experimental' it is because we have analysed and understood the results of that experiment.\n\n"

This is a specific tradition where it is believed that making progress means 'shocking the bourgeois'. There are other kinds of innovation. The bauhaus was once consciously 'avant garde' and made a contribution, though probably also did harm. But the art nouveau and art deco movements were, I believe, not 'in your face', but popular with the well-off of their day. And they too were important additions to type as well as other fields.\n\n"

In fact, one could argue that the paranoid departmental and sexual politics of most universities here is the perfect synthesis of Foucault's obsession with power and Derrida's deconstruction of truth.\n\n"
