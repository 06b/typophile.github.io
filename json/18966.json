I recentley opened up  \nHelvetica Regular and noticed that on the C they have  \nthese guidelines, in Tpye Tool it is located on the Vector  \ncontrol layer, that follow the curve. When I erase the  \nguidlines it then erases the section of the font.  \nWhat are these lines for and how do you use them?  \nThanks!\n\nj o s e p h\n\n [‹ What has been changed in Fontographer 4.7.3?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809001342/http:/typophile.com/node/18964 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Opentype PS vs Opentype TT ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809001342/http:/typophile.com/node/18821 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
