Any UC input is greatly appreciated.   \n   \nSorry about the exclusivity of the thread. The logotype is being kept somewhat under wraps, but I got approval to seek limited Typophile advice at this stage in the process. I'll post it here for general critique as soon as it's further on in the approval process.\n\n",
