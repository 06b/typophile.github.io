  "content": "One of the most beautiful logos out there, I think, is Abercrombie & Fitch's. Set in a modified Garamond Bold (I THINK), it just has a very calming, yet powerful effect to it. And I'd always wonder:\n\nHow would I, as the Designer for that logo, and any like it, know enough that a simple WORD/PHRASE is enough to be my client's logo? Does it suddenly strike you? Do you say to yourself that no symbol or additional accents are good enough to accompany this word?\n\nMore importantly: How do you approach a client? How do you say, \"Well I know you're paying me a lot of money, but I really think the best I can give you is our name in this font...\"\n\nEtc. Etc.\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

      "content": "I think that companies that can get away with a simple logotype are those with already extraordinary names. Abercrombie & Fitch doesn't need a mark to identify itself because it is identified by its name.\n\nConversely, companies like AT&T or Apple don't have names that can really stand alone without an icon. Hence Apple's almost exclusive use of their apple to brand their company or AT&T's use of their striped sphere.\n\nThe bottom line is that companies with memorable names don't need to try hard to create associations with other icons to strengthen consumer recognition. An understated yet elegant application of a type treatment is often the best way to let the name speak for itself.\n\npenn\n\n"
