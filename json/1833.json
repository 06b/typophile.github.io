He's such a gentleman -- even laughed obligingly when the interviewer said he was \"a font of knowledge,\" yuk yuk yuk. (The story was about the NYT headline overhaul with Cheltenham.)\n\n",

What a nice surprise it was.   \nBut I'm even more surprised after reading the first few paragraphs of the interview. I just used Cheltenham as a headline font on a recent (and very small) project about fire trucks. (And I'm not even close to being a font of knowledge)   \nI've really been interested lately in slab serifs, it started when I read this short article by Robin Williams awhile back:   \n   \n [http://www.eyewire.com/magazine/columns/robin/slabserifs/index.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123149/http:/www.eyewire.com/magazine/columns/robin/slabserifs/index.htm)   \n  \nMy other favorite slab at the moment is Chaparral MM. Anyhow, going to read the rest of the interview, thanks for the On the Media link!\n\n"
