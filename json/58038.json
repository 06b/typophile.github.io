Except for the A it seems quite similar to Canada Type's [Apricot](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031194115/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/apricot/). Mark Simonson's [Coquette](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031194115/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/coquette/) is less connected than this, but also has a rather similar feel.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
