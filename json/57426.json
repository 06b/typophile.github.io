  "content": "Hello,  \nI am designing the book about a theater.  \nThe text I am given contains a huge number of quotation marks:\n\n– names of plays  \n– role in the play  \n– names of artistic groups  \n– names of programs  \n– citations  \n– «ironic» meanings or metaphors,  \n– foreign language words\n\nI am trying to make all this emphases less obtrusive by changing all names of theater plays and foreign language words to Italic.  \nHow legitimate this approach is?\n\nthank you!\n\n",
