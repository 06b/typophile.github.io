      "content": "So far, I'm going with Midjungards, which will do, but it hasn't the arcane look for which I am seeking. If I paint it loosely, adding a diamond between words to enclose space rather more evenly and bring the weight of words together, it might serve the purpose. I may even add a bar across the top of certain letter combinations to introduce a dash of the Persian script, or, being daring, add a bar across the bottom with certain combinations to resemble god-knows what? Increased complication? Any comments?\n\n"
