      "content": "Thanks Paul.\n\nRe. the Palochka: My theory is that in this kind of scripty italic, a roman \"el\" represents the \"uncased\" version of \"I\" stylistically, i.e. a tall baseline-to-cap-height stroke.\n\nHowever, I could use the upper case italic \"I\" form, with four serifs, but make its stroke width much narrower, as I've done in the roman. In the italic, that wouldn't fit well with other characters, though. I wonder how the Palochka appears in text. Perhaps it's not an issue if it never appears in the middle of words. What language is it used in?\n\n"

      "content": "On further investigation:\n\nUnicode Standard, version 5: _Palochka. U+04C0 “I” cyrillic letter palochka is used in Cyrillic orthographies for a number of Caucasian languages, such as Adyghe, Avar, Chechen, and Kabardian. The name palochka itself is based on the Russian word for “stick,” referring to the shape of the letter. The glyph for palochka is usually indistinguishable from an uppercase Latin “I” or U+0406 “I” cyrillic capital letter byelorussian-ukrainian i; however, in some serifed fonts it may be displayed without serifs to make it more visually distinct. In use, palochka typically modifies the reading of a preceding letter, indicating that it is an ejective. The palochka is generally caseless and should retain its form even in lowercased Cyrillic text. However, there is some evidence of distinctive lowercase forms; for those instances, U+04CF cyrillic small letter palochka may be used._\n\nHere is how the Palochka appears when the font has a standard Cyrillic character set, and the typographer improvises:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pal1_6169.jpg)\n\nHere it is with my first attempt at proper unicode characters. The roman is acceptable, as per the Unicode chart specimen, but the italic is suspect:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pal2_4601.jpg)\n\nFrom a typographic perspective, one should look for correspondences in the alphabet.  \nHere is the Adyghe orthography:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Adyghe_5546.jpg)\n\nThere are two other characters with vertical strokes (other than those which incorporate the palotchka). The ef is not a good model in the italic, but the yeru is promising, and there is a pattern here, which the palotchka could fit into:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pal3_6597.jpg)\n\nThe practice referred to in the Unicode Standard, of a serifless stroke, should be discounted. Typographically, it is not enough like a letter, more like an accent or vertical bar. The \"exit serif\" in the italic serves to space the following character, and is not really something that can be dispensed with in this genre.\n\nTherefore, for consistency within Adyghe typography, the following lower case forms seem appropriate for this kind of serifed face:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pal4_4388.jpg)\n\nThis design answers the question--if there are two characters in the alphabet with ascenders, why would they be given different serif treatments? (Which is what the Unicode chart specimen does, by following the ad hoc practice of using capital I.) And why should there not be consistency between the vertical strokes in ef, yeru, and palotchka?\n\nHowever, as the roman ef shown above is an alternate, and the default in my font is this more exotic, symmetrical form, the Unicode configuration of palotchka roman is OK:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pal5_5887.jpg)\n\nBut this is tempting:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pal6_5895.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "to me the ы looks as if it is missing the top right serif on the second element. this probably depends on what models you've been looking at, but i'd suspect that _most_ Cyrillic typefaces would include the serif in this spot and if you follow this logic for a \"lowercase\" palochka, you would _essentially_ arrive at a form similar to the uppercase I for the roman. adapting an italic version of this does seem that it would be a bit of a challenge. i think using an l-shaped palochka is a decent solution, but of course, i am no expert.\n\n"

I had observed that historically in Adolf Darre's specimen (Harkov, 1888) this character, and \"small em\", had a horizontal left serif, not a \"pot hook\" like the rest of the italic lower case. While I generally stuck closely to Darre's letterforms, for some reason I felt I would rather change this detail. It's vanity I suppose, that no matter how good the original, there is always something a redesigner thinks he can improve upon.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/nmnrn_5353.jpg)\n\nI will post samples of my Cyrillic Swash alternates soon, in a new thread\n\n"
