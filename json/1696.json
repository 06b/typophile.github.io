Maybe you should try   \nusing the whole pentagon for the A, like you did   \nin U/W. And I really like your Z.   \n   \nI would cut the stroke in the upper pentagon   \nstroke of your W too.   \n   \nWhere are you planning to use this font   \nanyway? Just curious... ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113140336im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nhC\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your comments, they came in very handy.   \n   \nThe font is based on a piece of music that combines jungle (drum&bass) and ragga mc-ing (dancehall reggae). Ragga represented by the almost tribal form of the beehive double pentagon form, and jungle represented by the electronic clock way of forming letters in it..   \n   \nI might end up using it one time for a vynil cover or some stickers or something. Somewhere where legibility isn't that much of an issue :-)   \n   \nI worked on some alternates for the glyphs you mentioned:   \n   \nUsing the whole pentagon for the A sort of ruins the overall look, but I think the changed R might be enough to distinguish the two.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113140336im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/18847.gif)\n\n"
