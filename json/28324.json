They’re all a long way from Melbourne but worth a try.\n\np.62 of Neil Macmillans ’An A-Z of Type Designers’ gives Calisto as a 1987 design by Ron Carpenter. I remember reading about his design for Cantoria in an early piece of Monotype trade literature, but this may have predated Calisto. According to the source above, Carpenter has worked with Dalton Maag since 1996, so you could try looking on their website too.\n\n"
