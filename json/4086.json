Many book covers of a similar genre prefer to use typography rather than a graphical image to convey the message. However, I'm not sure whether the choice of fonts have been accidental. I want a font that conveys power and conflict. Any suggestions and justifications for use would be greatly appreciated...\n\n",

      "content": "K, I would suggest you begin with sketches. Maybe you can find a photo or design that would be appropriate. Then experiment with different faces superimposed on the images. Be careful about putting the cart before the horse. That doesn't work. Suppose we say Gill Sans Bold. How will your copy break? That's crucial to comprehension. But where will the copy be in relation to the elements in the photo, design, illo, whatever? Nail down your imagery first, then think about typefaces. They are interconnected and one size doesn't fit all.\n\n"

Despite my type-loving nature, I think that I agree that the typeface selection is not the _first_ question that someone should ask when they begin a project like this one.   \n   \nSome designers think that there are only a handfull of faces that anyone should ever use. Thankfully, I don't think that any of them are frequent visitors here. (Although, it would be tremendous fun to spar with them!)\n\n"

There's a whole other dimension to typographic design which has to do with how a line of copy is set for comprehension as well as aesthetics. Do your instructors at the school get into that?\n\n"

There are two routes essentially which I have taken, both aim to be simple and bold; the first is with simple graphic elements, and the second is with photographic imagery. My preference is with the non-photographic options that carry a bold headline. FYI, I'm no designer (no kidding!!?), just an editor in a small publishing house who enjoys dabbling in design!

Some are better at passing this thing along.   \n   \nAside from this, I actually don't believe that there is _really_ all that much of a proliferation of bad typefaces due to digital technology. I remember an interesting interview with Jonathan Hoefler (?), in which he refered to a type specimen book for the 19th Century that was jam-packed with crazy fonts, just like what we see today. People will most likely always experiment with these grunge (for lack of a better word) forms, and that makes me happy.\n\n"

There has been some internal debate as to whether T. Sq is the best example of nonviolent struggle...not to mention acquiring photographic rights.   \n   \nMy concern with using a single photograph is that it becomes too focused on one event rather than capturing the overall proactive 'emotions' or 'strategies'. Hence the reason for some of the simpler graphics which are more open to interpretation (but at the risk of being boring!).\n\n"

Condensed fonts like Trade Gothic's remind me of signs, but that might just be me.\n\n"
