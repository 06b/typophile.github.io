I looked at ITC Conduit, based on Yves' principle about DIN 'not-quites', but it is even less like the sample.\n\nYou also realize that the 'a' and 'e' are the same letter flipped over. The counters are not the same in DIN. The tail of the 't' is different, and so on.\n\nI believe this is a 'mutilated' font, but I can't believe that DIN was where it began. I will keep looking for a bit, to see if something else seems close, but there is also the possibility of a mixed-font origin, put together like Frankenstein's monster from various parts.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
