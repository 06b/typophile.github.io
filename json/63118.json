Do you have a co-worker who ALWAYS screws up stuff creating MORE work for you?\n\nDo you have a co-worker who kisses so much booty; you can look in their mouth and see what your boss had for lunch? Do you have a co-worker who is so obnoxious, when he/she enters a room, everyone else clears it? Well, on behalf of Ike Turner, I am so very, very glad to officially announce SLAP YOUR IRRITATING CO-WORKER DAY!!!\n\nHere are the rules you must follow:\n\n\\* you can only slap one person per hour - no more.\n\n\\* You can slap the same person again if they irritate you again in the same day.\n\n\\* You are allowed to hold someone down as other co- workers take their turns slapping the irritant.\n\n\\* No weapons are allowed...other than going upside somebody’s head with a stapler or a hole-puncher.\n\n\\* If questioned by a supervisor [or police, if the supervisor is the irritant], you are allowed to LIE, LIE, LIE!\n\nNow, study the rules, break out your list of folks that you want to slap the living day lights out of and get to slapping on October 23rd..... And have a great slapping day!!!!\n\n",

I wonder what your coworkers think of you? Perhaps they may feel that you need the slapping? This never works. It just escalates. Learn to deal with the various types of personalities in your world in a peaceful way or risk violent retribution from them.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Who knew.\n\nI wonder if that list made the rounds at Abu Ghraib?\n\ninteresting thing about humour: Context seems to matter\n\nMost males. OK, most slightly immature males (which is still most males) think the Three Stooges are at least a little bit funny. As do about 3% of similarly immature females. But there is always a big divide between their antics and real life that you have to accept in order to find them funny. Even as a little kid, when my friends and I would act out their skits and laugh ourselves silly, we knew that we could not really stick our fingers into each other’s eyes. There was never any doubt that the way they treated each other was only acceptable in the irrational world of the Three Stooges, where people can recover from being hit on the head with a 10 pound hammer in about 2 seconds just by shaking their heads and the audience can be shocked by their very violent behaviour while simultaneously being aware that it has no consequence. Which is, perhaps, how people can be comfortable with slapstick in the first place. Old ladies don’t break their hips when they slip on banana peels. It’s not real, doesn’t bare close scrutiny or cause anyone any harm and perhaps therein lies it’s cathartic effect.\n\nIf the joke above is funny, it’s to a smaller audience, perhaps. I meant, I really have no idea… I didn’t think it was funny, but obviously some do. It really looses a lot of momentum when it steps out of the slapstick world and presents itself as something in the real one - like a detailed list of violent assaults one is to commit in an environment where there are often real abuses taking place. Where people can go, and have gone–As they say–”postal”. Which is an expression that came out of real life events triggered by workplace bullying.\n\nSorry if this is a bit heavy, but just for some perspective, in the industry I work in, (but not the company I work for,) there was an incident a number of years ago: A man with mental issues was harassed and bullied. One day he brought a rifle to work. 4 people were killed. 2 were injured. As a result, very strict workplace harassment policies were instituted by my employer. Circulating that joke could result in some sort of disciplinary action and an automatic refresher course on the subjects of harassment, tolerance and respect for others.\n\nNow then, if we could have that list set in Comic Sans…\n\n-=®=-\n\n-=®=-\n\n"
