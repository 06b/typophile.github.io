Anyway.\n\nI need some advice in mocking something up. I attached a pdf of the page cover in question. I’d like to mock it up how I spec’d it for the project, colored paper with 3 colors on the front, one of which is white. When I turned it in before I did the whole photoquality epson matte paper on boards, but I have an interview (!) the week of the 22nd and would like to have it lookin’ good. So the question is, without screen printing, is it possible to mock up a hit of white ink on colored paper ?\n\nSee pdf.\n\nThx everyone\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [FinalSeed.indd.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20060523165131/http:/typophile.com/files/FinalSeed.indd.pdf) | 40.07 KB |\n\n",

Or the blackletter a closed fist to the face?\n\nThe latter is way too overbearing to my mind and is effectively screaming at me (sshhhhhh). At the very least I think I’d pull the tint back a bit.\n\nThe former has too many competing styles going on: the top italics, the middle caps, the bottom caption; each of these three units has a different personality, and they’re jockying too much for distinction. Any reason that these three units aren’t in the same type?\n\nAlso, there is a weight issue with the small-cap/all-cap setting in the middle. Are those small-caps? Or just smaller caps?\n\n"
