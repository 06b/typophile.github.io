This is definitely not based on anything.\n\n[Jason Walcott](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824161303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Jason%20Walcott) sure knows how to handle curly stuff, so maybe check his [Jukebox Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824161303/http:/www.veer.com/products/vendor.aspx?vendor=jbt) faces.\n\n"
