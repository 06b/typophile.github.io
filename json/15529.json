I thought it could be DIN or Mittelschrift but both typefaces don’t seem to match exactly.\n\nThank you in advance :-) ,\n\nOliver\n\n",

      "content": "»Gravur Condensed« has rounded tips. The logo you link to does not have rounded endings.  \nThe logo font is much more like a »DIN 1451« or a variation thereof. In fact, it is not DIN, however, it is so close as to call it a variation of DIN.  \nThe upper bowl of the capital B is smaller on the logo. DIN’s capital B has identically sized bowls both upper and lower. Also, the endings on the capital S finish with a straight edge on the logo, whereas DIN’s capital S does not have such a feature.\n\nMore searching is needed.\n\nFor a DIN example of this company name, see:  \n [http://flickr.com/photos/luxuryluke/3081004809/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090614065525/http:/flickr.com/photos/luxuryluke/3081004809/ \"http://flickr.com/photos/luxuryluke/3081004809/\")\n\n"
