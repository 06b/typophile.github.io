  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to move some fonts (in this case Sabon) over from an older Mac onto a Leopard system.\n\nThe fonts are FFIL/LWFN suitcases and there is a separate folder with .AFM metrics files.\n\nBy just opening the FFIL in FontBook, the font seems to install but ligatures don't to work unless I use the font in InDesign. (i.e. the fi and fl ligatures are there in the list of glyphs but don't get automatically replaced).\n\nIs there something else I need to do to enable the ligatures? I haven't restarted the computer since the install, would that help?\n\n",

If your font contain properly encoded ligature fi or fl (maybe other ligatures too), it is used in your text. It won't work in any other application and it has nothing to do with font management software.\n\n"
