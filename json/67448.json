  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm not sure this is the exact right place for this, but I'm trying to track down the typographer of a free script font that's all over the freebie sites.\n\nFont is Monika Italic [link removed by moderator] and the credit goes to \"Catrina\" (for whom I cannot seem to find any info whatsoever).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041444im_/http:/typophile.com/files/monika_italic_sample_4520.png)\n\nI'd like to use this in a commercial piece (all accompanying license info says it's freeware, but the font file is unembeddable which indicates otherwise). Can anyone either point me in the right direction, or perhaps suggest a suitable alternative ('50s-era italic script)? This is a pro bono project, so sadly I need to lean toward free or cheap.\n\nThanks so much!\n\n",
