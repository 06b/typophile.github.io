  "content": "Would love it if someone could identify this serif font, I've been looking for it for ages.\n\nI'd describe it as a modern, stylish serif font, with thin geometric serifs, used in a lot of youth culture and hipster contexts. I've included a photo of it from the Australian counter-culture surf magazine, STAB. Sorry it's a photograph so it might be slightly warped but you'll get the idea.\n\nAny similar fonts would be appreciated too.\n\nCheers!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [WhatFont.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140312045408/http:/typophile.com/files/WhatFont_1.jpg) | 42.01 KB |\n\n",
