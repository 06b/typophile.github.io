  "content": "I’m in my fourth and final year of a design degree and am working on my final project. The project is a hypothetical, where the advertising industry (’Madison Ave’) is feeling the effects of the global recession and is embarking on a widespread advertising campaign. The whole thing is very much anti-advertising, and is designed to highlight how the idea of ’the consumer’ is really a product of the advertising industry. [This](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203950/http:/www.danflan.com.au/links/poster.jpg) might give you a better idea of the whole idea, or if your really keen I’ve posted my brief up [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203950/http:/danflan.com.au/madisonave/?page_id=2).\n\nAnyway, although its all early stages at the moment, I’m up to the visual identity bit (small part of the assignment, but pretty important for everything to come), and am eager to get some outside feedback.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203950im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Post1_1_6202.jpg)\n\nVisually, the aim of the identity is to appear slightly detached from the content. I want the logo to be somewhat ambiguous — playfully neutral — and hardly distinguished from a design one might expect from companies manufacturing pharmaceuticals or light-globes. Aside from a few clues, the logo that I have identified doesn’t say all that much about the ‘client’, and isn’t supposed to.\n\nThe alternate ideas all had a few issues associated with them (the first one is a bit cliche, the second one doesnt scale well), but have included them here for good measure.\n\nFinally, I know this is probably too much to ask, and of course feedback in any form would be massively appreciated, but I’ve set up a blog at [http://www.danflan.com.au/madisonave](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203950/http:/www.danflan.com.au/madisonave) (as an assessable task) to keep track of the project and for this sort of thing so any posts on that page would be appreciated beyond belief,\n\nAnyway, love to hear what you think, criticisms and any suggestions,\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDan Flan\n\n [‹ Kibbeh House - suggestions?](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203950/http:/typophile.com/node/56632 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo for a nueva company ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203950/http:/typophile.com/node/54953 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Do you have any ideas?\n\nCheers\n\nDan\n\n"

The shape is supposed to be a TV screen (I guess that’s what YouTube was probably going for as well..)\n\nAlthough I still like the look of a few of those shapes in series, I would be kind of happy to ditch that shape anyway because making the t.v. association is really pigeon holing advertising to just one type of advertising.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203950im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Post1_2_6700.jpg)\n\nAnyway, putting the shape to one side, and taking Wills suggestion on board, I have put these together as a start,\n\nLove to hear out of these, what direction — if any — everyone thinks is appropriate\n\nDan\n\n"

I didn’t think that the first one resembled Youtube. I very much liked colour choice. But two lines under AD were distracting, because they looked like illegible text under main headline.\n\nFrom the latest batch I would like to know, what are you trying to emphasize here, because it looks like you can’t decide. Is it MAD or is it AD? OR would you rather write “MAD AVE AD” instead... :)\n\n@epsilicon: that really is a great ad.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

Out of curiosity, do you think that this is necessarily a bad thing considering their common origins? Is this (originally unintended) pop-culture reference at all appropriate?\n\nIncidentally, Mad Men season 1 is due to air on Australian free to air in the next few weeks, looking forward to seeing whether it lives up to the hype..\n\nWill:  \nThanks for your suggestion, I’ll give it a go in the next round\n\nEpsillicon:  \nThat ad is amazing, thanks for posting it. He’s living the dream\n\nAlaskan:  \nThelma and Louise is actually only two degrees from Kevin Bacon. Geena Davis was in Cutthroat with Frank Langella who was in Frost/Nixon with Kevin Bacon\n\nLitera:  \nI really like your suggestion for the name, and in an ideal world I would probably run with it. However, such an application would probably go over the head of the intended audience. Speaking with people about my project so far, I’ve found that a lot of people— although liking the name — have never heard of Madison Ave. and those who have often don’t make the association with advertising. Being clever with the name like that would almost certainly add to the confusion.\n\nYou’re completely right about the two lines under AD being distracting and looking like illegible text, thanks for that, I’ll keep it in mind with upcoming revisions. And thank you for liking the colours, I’m also really happy with them.\n\nTo answer your question, as you guessed, I’m being a bit indecisive, but I think I’m probably more inclined to highlight the MAD as suggested by William. I’m only continuing to highlight the AD to address the above problem of people not linking Madison Avenue with advertising.\n\nWhat do you think? Have I been speaking to a select few people who just don’t get the reference?\n\nThanks for your words,\n\nDan\n\n"
