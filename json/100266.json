  "content": "The latest megalomaniacal threat from the financial globalists wants to saddle the world economy with a cost of trillions of dollars that benefits favorite corporatists. The phony global warming cult has a core purpose. Their objective is to drive down the standard of living for non-elites and prevent the use of fossil fuel energy. The fallacious science used to create a disinformation scare for politically unsophisticated “True Believers” is a direct result of transnational money manipulators. The Davos crowd sponsors the educational and media institutions that trump up junk research and manufacture idealistic solutions.\n\nscary, isn't it?\n\n",

      "content": "The consensus of the world scientific community is not junk science; junk science is that which differs from the consensus of recognized competent researchers.\n\nIt is trivially possible to avoid the bad consequences for people living in tropical Third World countries of global warming without reducing energy consumption.\n\nNuclear power can provide us with electricity to meet all our needs dependably for hundreds of years; unlike fusion power, thorium breeders are already practical.\n\nElectricity can heat our homes. What about our cars?\n\nElectrolysis can make hydrogen from water, but it's not so easy to make carbon from carbon dioxide. Fortunately, hydrogen can be used with carbon dioxide as an input to the Sabatier process, the outputs of which can be used as the inputs of the Fischer-Tropsch process.\n\nFischer-Tropsch: it's not just for making motor fuel out of coal any more.\n\nSo, there you are: total carbon neutrality, with no need to run out and buy new cars.\n\n"
