      "content": "More particularly, you could search for 'fraktur' and 'textura' as these are the historical models for the majority of heavy metal lettering (why is that?). The mötorhead logo has been extensively worked over, however, particularly in the way the m h and d angle away below the baseline, and quite possibly the h and the a have been borrowed from some other font altogether, so you won't be able to match it exactly with anything straight off the shelf.\n\nWhy not use Adobe Ironwood instead? Or, if you can find it, Cloister Black? Or go mangle up your own setting of Monotype Old English Text?\n\n"
