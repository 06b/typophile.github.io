  "content": "Hey guys. I need to translate a piece of advertising at my agency but the guys who were working on it before I arrived didn't leave the text editable. Could you help me identify these various fonts? I found one very similar for the \"MAGICAL\" image (SimpleLife) but I'd like to know the original font as well, if there is one.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MAGICAL.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824142955/http:/typophile.com/files/MAGICAL.png) | 219.15 KB |\n| [GRAPES.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824142955/http:/typophile.com/files/GRAPES.png) | 445.52 KB |\n| [PRESSED.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824142955/http:/typophile.com/files/PRESSED.png) | 91.1 KB |\n\n",
