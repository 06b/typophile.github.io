  "content": "OK, so when should ragged right be hyphenated? I prefer a hard rag, but I can see how hyphenation might save a little space and make the rag a bit less jagged.   \n   \nAlso, I wonder what you all think about ragged right captions under photos. This seems to make sense to me, and yet I do see publications that H&J their captions. This seems to lead to inferior overall spacing. Any thoughts?\n\n",
