  "content": "Although I'm a designer, I figure that you guys here may have more experience with type and I'd like to ask for your opinion and advice for choosing a font for a project.\n\nSo, here I go: I need a nice typeface for a **identity** for a Church of England parish in London, which also includes separate community projects etc.\n\n.\n\nMy thoughts so far:\n\n\\* type should have a modern feel  \n\\* needs to work in all sorts of contexts: from births, over parties, to funerals\n\n.\n\nThe typeface should lend itself to work well in all sorts of applications, for example:\n\n\\* stationary, brochures and leaflets  \n\\* signage  \n\\* type-based posters that make an impact  \n\\* projector display, e.g song lyric displays and presentations\n\n.\n\nOther requirements/restrictions:\n\n\\* We're on a budget! So low price is a key. The font would be used on about 4 machines.  \n\\* Should possibly be OpenType (use on Mac and PC)  \n\\* The name of the organisation is  \n**Parish of St Mary Magdalene and St David's Churches**.  \nI am concerned of the two 'M's and a lower case 'g' to look pleasant. I wonder whether it might be nice to have the 'g' as 2 storey.\n\nI think that a **sans serif** typeface would be the way to go, as I definitely want to get away from the traditional feel of church. At the same time there should be a certain feeling of respect -- so nothing weird.\n\n.  \nI have done some searching and have come up with a list that I feel is possible in terms of budget and style.\n\nCould you please advice and **put some reason with your recommendation**? That would be really nice. Suggestions for anything amazingly fitting that I've overlooked are welcome -- otherwise please work from the list.\n\nAs a general question: How strongly do you feel about using a serif typeface alongside the main type, e.g. for headings...?\n\n.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n [Delicious](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html)  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n_Family (7) FREE_  \nWould anything really make me choose this apart from the price?\n\n.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n [Alber](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MjI1&fontview=specimen)  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n_Family (8) for $210_  \nI'm wondering whether these would be a bit too condensed for general use.

Somehow I feel that this has a more churchy character than the previous two, but then again somehow it feels like a commercial company having recently done a re-branding, or am I wrong?\n\n.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n [Credo](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.p22.com/rtf/Products/Credo.html)  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n_Family (6) for $170_\n\n.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n [Aaux](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.t26.com/fonts/fontsearch.php?q=aaux)  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n_Aaux Pro A (12) + Black $98_  \nI guess the price is good. It's also nice that there are a lot of options to get more of the family, or even the Aaux Office family if there a bit more sophisticated job came up.

The church should look fresh and relevant to people -- especially those outside the church. Also, it needs to be used in many different contexts, and I think that Beorcana goes a bit too far into just one direction.\n\n===  \nEDIT  \nwell, having just seen **[this](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.linussebastian.com/northside/index.html)** makes me wonder. I guess it would be good to have a headline/quote font combined with a more 'straight' one for general text.\n\n"

I've just had a quick play and they seem work well together too. They are quite tonally compatible. They lend themselves to quite open spacing, so I don't see why they shouldn't be able to comply with the situations you mentioned and get a modern and approachable look. It may take a bit of extra effort to get the spacing/feed/layout combinations working just so, but that's where the time goes. Serif heading, sans text, vice versa, nice coolour palette - could look the business.\n\nJust a thought, but if you wanted a character or two modified for this client, he looks like the kind of chap who might oblige.\n\nSave the dosh for the organ fund, or something nice for the christmas party.\n\nAnd remember everybody - e for envelopes (stationery).\n\n"

Here is what we came up with, and **maybe you can give more opionion and advice on this. Would be great!**  \nIt seems we are not quite there yet.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n1. We did not think much of faces that appeared to be chosen especially thinking of 'church' - e.g. stuff with traditional connotations.\n\n2. We wanted some face that has something rasonably special about it, e.g. noting like Depot or Albert, so that we can justify spending some money, rather than just using Arial/Times NR or such.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Therefore:**\n\nIn the end, after having also looked at what you can get for what price we thought that we'd like to use  \n **[Locator](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/index.html)and [Locator Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locatordisplay/index.html) possibly in conjunction with a serif face**.  \nHowever, I've just now discovered that [the low price on the site](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/purchase.html) is for a 1-computer license only, and it seems to get too expensive for more.\n\nWhat can we do? Locator seems just nice with this extra Display version. Also it would work well on Projector display during church services - nice and clear.  \nThe only worry I had with Locator is whether the low cap height would make it actually more difficult to read, esp on a projection screen, and it seems fairly wide, forcing smaller point sizes to fit content.\n\n**So, are there any other suggestions as an alternative to Locator?**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnother typeface I liked is **[PMN Caecilia](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1381.html)**. (I think,I like it better than Absara Serif, poms).  \nWhat are you views?  \nI'm a bit worried to display anything serif on a projector where people have to head and speak/sing out words on the spot (good readability is essential).  \nBut maybe this coud serve as a headline typeface?\n\nOr would I choose **[Chaparral](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501040149/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1381.html)** instead?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThanks for your replies.\n\n"

I just don't think any of them convey a whole lot of warmth.\n\nI've used Chaparral extensively for instruction manuals and can tell you that it's never disappointed me, but I'm not so sure I would use it for wedding announcements or other church stuff. But then, I don't go to church.\n\nLike someone else said, Cronos is an excellent, legible, warm sans with most of the OpenType luxuries you could want. Shouldn't be too be expensive.\n\n"
