This new issue contains contributions of Elliott Earls, Chris Vermaas & Cyrus Highsmith, Ties Alfrink & Marc de Bruijn, Hugo de Pagter, Stoffel den Drijver, Jan Willem Stas & Rick Vermeulen, Paul Mijksenaar, Zack Ostrowski, Jocelyn Fuller, Kristen Borchardt, Christine Niemeier, Doug Kisor, Evert Bloemsma & Jan Middendorp, Anka Kresse, Pekka LÃ¤hde and type-basics by Underware.   \n   \n5 Pts. is world-wide available in specialized bookshops. Pts. is published by Underware, Den Haag, the Netherlands.   \n   \nYou wanna see what the book looks like?   \n [http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=underware&id2=publications&id3=pts&id4=5pts&id5=general](http://web.archive.org/web/20090525205636/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=underware&id2=publications&id3=pts&id4=5pts&id5=general)\n\n",
