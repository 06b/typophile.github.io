  "content": "Hi guys (and Tiffany), I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to solve a problem I've been stuck on for months now. I may have posted about it before but can't seem to find it now, so am asking again.\n\nI am converting some GPL'd Dravidian fonts to AAT so that the scripts work correctly on my computer, and have been unable to replicate the GPOS mark‐to‐mark and mark‐to‐base positioning features. I would really prefer to avoid creating a huge kern table as there are no tools to help edit those. I basically want to move swaras and vattus around in a context dependant way.\n\nSince I didn't design the fonts and the originators will update them from time to time I'd prefer not to modify/create glyphs of my own.\n\nA sample of the incorrect rendering:  \n [http://web.nickshanks.com/typography/Kedage\\_errors.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191313/http:/web.nickshanks.com/typography/Kedage_errors.png \"http://web.nickshanks.com/typography/Kedage\\_errors.png\")\n\n",
