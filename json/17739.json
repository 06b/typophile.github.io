The essay outlining Carter’s lifelong work was  \ncomposed by Margaret Re, American researcher of typography and a curator of  \nthe exhibition Typographically Speaking: The Art of Matthew Carter. It also  \nincludes an overview of all Carter’s typefaces composed since 1963.  \nOn further twenty pages of the magazine, Carter was interviewed by our  \nPolish contributor Adam Twardoch, recapitulating his career, sharing his  \nintimate views on the work of a typographer, and even revealing personal  \ndetails from the life of this typographic star.\n\nThe TYPO magazine is published bi-monthly in English and Czech since January  \n2003. It contains 32-44 full color pages printed on high quality coated  \npaper of 250 × 310 mm format. Information on subscriptions at  \n [www.magtypo.cz](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808140658/http:/www.magtypo.cz/ \"www.magtypo.cz\").
