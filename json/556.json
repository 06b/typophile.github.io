Somebody must have made this on a PC, not on a Mac, because I got this on a PC disc (this is just my guess).   \n   \nI know it sound odd that I don't know who they are... I work for a packaging company and I get so many requests to recreate logos from all over the U.S. That is why I sometimes need help here to identify fonts that I cannot tell.   \n   \nBefore I knew about Typophile, it was much harder because forum at myfonts is o.k. Somebody there wrote about Typophile, so I came here... This is the best site ever for me, and I appreciate you guys sooooo much.   \n   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101230172855im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12727.jpg)\n\n"
