Do you have bow ties in Europe? I don't recall seeing any except in England now that I think about it. Typographic bow ties would be nice, but I'm not holding my breath. I've got a few typographic socks and definitely want more.\n\nI'm interested in type specimens, especially any san serif stuff. Any pointers to libraries would be appreciated.\n\nGeorge  \nI was sad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni.\n\n",

I've been trolling lists of antiquarian dealers and not finding anything -- most appear to be in Utrecht -- so I missed Nijhof & Lee. So far they're all I've got on my list though.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n"
