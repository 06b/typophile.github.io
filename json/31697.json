I know a lot of the members here use a Mac-based font management solution (like Suitcase Fusion or Linotype Font Explorer X).\n\nAnyway, I'm actually curious if anyone's had the pleasure of testing this product out? Is it really worth the $50 upgrade cost? Does it add any new features (other than Vista support?) I've been using Suitcase 9.2 for a long time now, an updated version would be nice, if there's any merit to the update. Also, what happened to version 10?\n\nI know there's a few Extensis people on this board, do you have any information to add?\n\n",
