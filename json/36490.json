This is the only font that has some of these characteristic simplified Lombardic-inspired letters, especially this T. The H looks like two lines joining two I’s; the E and S seem like Blackmoor simplifications. The A and N are the most modified, and to me look similar to some of the letterforms in Aquitaine Initials, another Letraset font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
