  "content": "Hi  \nDoes anyone know of a comparison of languages in terms of how much space they occupy in text? I once designed a bilingual annual report, with both norwegian and english text. The english part was an unabbreviated translation of the norwegian version.\n\nWhen i started the project, i figured the norwegian version would need more space. It turned out the opposite was true.\n\nAn index for different languages would sure be useful, especially when planning larger projects. it could look like this (i set english=100)\n\nGerman = 112  \nEnglish = 100  \nNorwegian = 93\n\nOf course, this wouldn't apply for poetry etc, and i guess there would be differences between e.g. fiction and scientific litterature.\n\nalex\n\n",

The source language is the most compact, as it is using native words for native ideas.\n\nThere is a table of lengths for translations from English [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106080239/http:/www.cucumis.org/help_1_h/p_le_.html). (Note that the Asian languages at the bottom seem very compact, but in fact they are longer on the page.)\n\n"

      "content": "Maxim Zhukov produced some years ago two editions of a book dealing with multilingual typography. I have found them helpful. There is comparative data about relative lengths of languages as well as commentary about special considerations for each language under consideration. I do not know if Norwegian is included [the book's at home; I'm at work].\n\nThe book is \"Typography: Polyglot\" (1991, Cooper Union), written with George Sadek. The second edition is \"Typographia Polyglotta\" (1997, ATypI / Cooper Union). It may be tough to find this many years on.\n\npowers\n\n"
