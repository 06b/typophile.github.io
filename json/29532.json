The J, K, C and S are also hard to find in combination anywhere; and of course the low Ä is really _not_ common at all.\n\nI pretty much hunted the condensed sansserifs at MyFonts, and the best I could come up with were Storm’s [’Ohrada’](http://web.archive.org/web/20081030030847/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/ohrada/), Berthold’s [’AG Condensed’](http://web.archive.org/web/20081030030847/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/medium-condensed/) and [’Silverscreen’](http://web.archive.org/web/20081030030847/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/silverscreen/), from TypeArt.\n\nThis is a good mystery, because condensed sans faces are used a lot, but I am coming to the conclusion that this is from an obscure source — maybe a small European foundry.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

It looks very strange in words with double-Ä, and that’s not unusual in Finnish, as you can see in this nonsense sentence:\n\n“kääntäisitkö äänilevyn kääntöpuolen ääriasentoon?”\n\n"
