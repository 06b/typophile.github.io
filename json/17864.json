Maybe a simple id.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081005112930im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cawus.jpg)\n\nThanks in advance,  \nRichard\n\n [‹ (x) TrendyWeb.omgheadshot.com - Yanone Kaffeesatz {Marc O}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081005112930/http:/typophile.com/node/17863 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Predigital fonts - various {gang} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081005112930/http:/typophile.com/node/17806 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It doesn’t quite match the samples [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081005112930/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=romana) because there were a number of different versions. I would guess that the one in your sample was a film font version from the seventies.\n\n"
