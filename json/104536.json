So here is a link to the [Bitsteam version](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828235822/http:/www.fonts.com/font/bitstream/goudy-heavyface/condensed).  \nIf Goudy Heavyface Condensed was used as the basis for the wordmark, some further horizontal squeeze was done and some relatively minor modifications were made to the letters, except for s, which grew a long tail, and p which now has an old-style bottom terminal. The comma is clipped into a stubby tear shape.  \nDon \n"
