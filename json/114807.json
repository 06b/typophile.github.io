[http://www.waldenfont.com/product.asp?productid=16](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904012924/http:/www.waldenfont.com/product.asp?productid=16 \"http://www.waldenfont.com/product.asp?productid=16\")  \nNow this is a real challenge to font detectives. The Walden images show fonts that are hauntingly familiar but Walden gives them names that completely different from the real ones. For example Dragoo WF matches Metropolis Shaded by W. Schwerdtner for Stempel [1932]. See the digital version by Castle Type [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/metropolis-ct/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904012924/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/metropolis-ct/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/metropolis-ct/\")  \nSo is there a font detective who can identify some of the mystery fonts?  \nDon\n\n",

I only know this because it's in the ReadMe file for Nick Curtis's [Bric-A-Braque](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904012924/http:/moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/b.htm).

The Solotype Catalog shows a sample of this a Chikamauga. Dennis Ortiz-Lopez (Rolling Stone Magazine type master) digitized this as [OL Smokler Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904012924/http:/old.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-smokler/).

Rallph Unger digitized it as [Parfum](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904012924/http:/old.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/parfum/).\n\nMaximo - bear with me- is very similar to Nick Curtis's digitization of (again from a Nick Curtis ReadMe file) a typeface shown in a Dover clipart book called Art Deco Initials. Apparently , the editor presented an extrapolation of several incomplete typefaces of the era to show a complete alphabet. Nick's version of that can be had as [Big Apple](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904012924/http:/moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/b.htm). Walden's version is slightly different, so perhaps the resource was different ... ? I dunno.\n\nNuisance appears to be a version of a face that David Rakowski did an early digitization of as Hartin 2. Prior versions included Hartin and [Harting](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904012924/http:/moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/rakowski/dr3/davy_f3.htm). The Solotype Catalogue (prre-digital) gives a showing as Ribbonfaced Typewriter. No idea what the original was.\n\n"
