I agree that the existence of design patent protection makes it possible for the US Copyright Office to shrug off demands for copyright protection: 'Take your typeface across the road to the Patent and Trademark Office. They'll look after you'. But not availing oneself of the available protection isn't going to stir the Copyright Office's heart either.   \n   \nIn response to Gerald: the USA offers design patent protection for typeface design. It does not offer copyright protection; this was confirmed in the Esselte vs. Ringer case (note, however, that I'm aware of at least two analyses of the case, written by lawyers, that suggest the case was poorly argued and the decision in error). Unlike copyright protection, a design patent must be actively sought (it is not automatic), the review process is more rigorous (for example, you have to provide exhaustive examples of prior art that may have influenced the design), and is for a much more limited period of time (I can't remember what it is in the US; the Canadian equivalent is Industrial Design Protection, which is for 14 years).   \n   \nSome other countries provide copyright protection for typeface design, and the sky hasn't fallen yet.\n\n"

There are plenty of creations which are indisputably in the public domain. The melody which many of us know as \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" (or the alphabet song) is in the public domain; I need no one's permission to write a song based on it. Shakespeare's plays are in the public domain; I don't need anyone's permission to publish my own copy of his text. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa is in the public domain; I don't need any one's permission to paint my own copy of it. The creative merits of such an act may be debatable, but the legality is not. (Unless I try to pass my copy off as the original, in which case it's fraud; but that's another legal matter.)   \n   \nIntellectual property right protections do not last forever.   \n   \n(It should be noted, however, that any given photograph of the Mona Lisa may not be in the public domain, so I can't just go around indiscriminately reproducing someone else's \\*photo\\* of the painting.)   \n   \n_\\>The remote possibility of existing trademarks and   \n\\>registration legalities are more of a concern here. These would pass   \n\\>on to those parties who acquired the assests of the firm._      \n   \nYes, you make a good point. Aside from copyright and patent, there are trademark considerations. But, as with patents, U.S. trademark registration is also a very restricted protection. A period of three years of non-use may be enough for a mark to be considered abandoned, unless acceptable reasons are given and the proper papers are filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. I don't know if Kingsley-ATF did this or not.   \n   \nBut I believe that this protection would extend only to the ATF name and logo, and probably some of the actual names of typefaces, presuming they were properly registered. I don't think there is any aspect of the specimen that could qualify for protection as \"trade dress.\" And merely reproducing the logo is not necessarily sufficient to constitute infringement, especially if the reproduction is in the context of the company's own publication.   \n   \n\\>It wouldn't really matter in the eyes of the law that Graham has   \n\\>provided an \"admirable service\" if someone who had the legal right to   \n\\>challenge his efforts chose to do so.   \n   \nGranted. My comment wasn't meant as a legal defense.   \n   \nBut let's review: I think we've established and agreed that the book itself is no longer protected by copyright. There is a slim chance that some of the typefaces shown may have been granted a U.S. patent, but (as I think John noted) that protection has probably expired; and, regardless, merely reproducing the showings would not violate patent protection. Finally, trademark protection, if any still applies, would only cover the names and the logo; and I maintain that publishing the images of the specimen on the web would not constitute trademark infringement.   \n   \nBut -- correct me if I'm wrong -- I get the impression that your initial concern was not so much with Graham's right to reproduce the specimen pages, as with what others might do with the images. If so, I contend that we can not reasonably hold Graham responsible for these possibilities, any more than we hold libraries responsible because they make their collections accessible and provide public photocopiers. If there is any subsequent infringement on the rights of ATF's successors by someone swiping a typeface design, then I think that lies squarely on the \"swiper\".   \n   \n[Standard Disclaimer: I'm not a licensed IP attorney, etc., etc.]   \n   \n-- K.   \n   \nP.S.

      "content": "Kent   \n   \nVery thoroughly reasoned. I guess my initial reaction was to the idea that you can just reproduce whatever you want simply because it is no longer copyrighted and I was trying to point out there may be other factors to consider.   \n   \nIn a book I did a while back we had to enter hyphens in the names of characters used by Kipling in his Just So Stories because we discovered a famous movie producer had trademarked the names for toy marketing. Our legal advice was to copyright the hyphens as \"additional material.\" Kipling's work was certainly in public domain but there was also a Kipling Museum trust which still owned certain properties.   \n   \nWhat am I saying is you can't be too careful, and you can be at considerable risk. If you run a small business, a cease and decease or any other kind of legal threat could quickly drain your financial resources and put you out of business, whether or not the threatening action had legal merit. You would have to prove otherwise and that is costly. If you are doing anything of a \"publishing\" nature you do need to run this all through legal search (trademark, copyright, etc).   \n   \nThanks for the information.\n\n"

If I use the term Adobe Systems in a book I am required to either indicate trademark or print a disclaimer regarding trademark. One would not have to follow this in most cases, in discourse intended for a public audience, such as reviews or criticism, as Adobe is a recognized public name and has, in fact, sought that out.   \n   \nBut I can also not copy the visual representation of the Adobe logo without their permission, whether or not I intend to use this for commercial purposes, and I believe this is where your post may be in error.   \n   \nRegistration of name is more tricky because it can be legislated by state.\n\n"

My point was that the typefaces displayed in the ATF book are not an issue; the typefaces are what most of the discussion was about. The trademark on a particular typeface only prevents you from making another typeface based on it; there is no restriction on how the letter shapes are used in other media.\n\n"

It was about possible infringement for reproducing the pages from the book, which happens to be a type specimen book.   \n   \nI think Kent's remarks were the clearest regarding the legalities of all of this. And I doubt anyone would argue against your point about the usage of a legally acquired typeface.   \n   \nIt's mainly been a problem of the trademark of a typeface \"name\" though hasn't it, rather than the design per se? Someone reissuing someone's elses typeface with a different name? I recall that Adobe goes through extraordinary lengths to ensure that when they issue an original typeface, the name they choose is quite free and clear.\n\n"
