I like it (and the logo!) a lot…\n\nI have noticed the Ferox PDF with my old interview has two errors: my surname is mispelled \"Puccinini\" on the first page, and (despite the intentions) I have not released anything up to date with Rodrigo at Psy-Ops. So it should read just \"Emigre and Village\"…\n\n"
