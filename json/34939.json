  "content": "Hello everyone, I thought I would start by just saying I have been lurking here ever since I started my internship at CJ&P (this logo design) about a month ago. Just reading all of your discussions has really helped me a lot. And wouldn’t you know it, as soon as I wanted to join... Typophile went under for a couple of days!\n\nAnyways, like I said I am currently interning at CJ&P, an ad firm. They wanted me to start working on a website for them but to really fit the website I had to mess around with their logo a bit (which they encouraged). Anyways, here is what I have come up with so far . Basically I am trying to take the same idea and modernize it just a bit. They like it, but for some reason I am not completely satisfied, some issues I can’t identify are nagging me. Any comments would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(new: top, old: bottom)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [compare.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080107181648/http:/typophile.com/files/compare.jpg) | 52.52 KB |\n\n [‹ Rock Fuel](http://web.archive.org/web/20080107181648/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33277 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New logo work (aviation) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080107181648/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35328 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

(Like making it way smaller and pushing it up a bit, so it slips between the circles of ’J’ and ’P’?)\n\nDav\n\n"

It’s just that I’ve seen so many logos like this and there isn’t much originality in it. You could try and tie in the “&” more like a unique graphic element with the letters.\n\n"

However, about the circles and such: they like the circles a lot and they like the fact that it does tie in so much to the original logo. The thing they now want is more depth in the actual logo itself. The only thing I can think of is an apple aqua effect... and I don’t want to do that.\n\n"
