I like the fact that it’s also an ambigram, but generally I don’t think they really work. Any ideas? Or should I just pursue another direction altogether?\n\nOh yeah, you can just ignore the text in the lower right corner - I was just playing around drawing some letterforms on a grid. I might try and take that somewhere though, if this ambigram logo refuses to work.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705145119im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/osologo_5769.jpg)\n\n [‹ Logo Feedback - What you see?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705145119/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28492 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logotype not associated to anything(!?!) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705145119/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37902 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I think it’s actually pretty striking. I’d keep working on it. I see a pair of eyes and even a bit of an infinity loop. When you’ve been given good initials to work with, sometimes you just need to go with it.\n\nI would work them out in black and white first before delving into color, as that sometimes obscures your focus on the form. If I had to pick one, I’d say version 1. I’d like to see 1a and 1b out of the containing shape, though. You get a fairly interesting footprint created by the forms that is lost when you put it in the shape.\n\nThe only section that feels a little awkward to me is the very middle connection between the top right and bottom left arc. You might need to fudge the geometry a bit to make it feel right. Sometimes optically right is better than purely geometrically right, if that makes sense.\n\nKeep going.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the input!\n\nThe curves of #1 are probably a bit sloppy, that’s the only one I drew with the pen tool - the rest were done with concentric circles and liberal amounts of Pathfinder operations.\n\nThe idea with the bounding box was originally to try and use the negative space to assemble the logo, but it didn’t work out so well, so I ended up extending the box. What irritated me about 1 and 2 was the abrubt cut-off on the sides, hence the revised versions. But I’ll work on this a bit more. Appreciate the tips.\n\nFunny you should mention a pair of eyes, though, as I’ve been using this silly mark to sign my pencil drawings for some time now (excuse the crappy digital photo crop, no scanner nearby at the moment):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705145119im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/ososign_5394.jpg)\n\n"
