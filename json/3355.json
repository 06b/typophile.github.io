There's a nice UNIX utility, called XBDF, I think. And I think I once saw some funky online utility for making bitmap fonts. But why not just use Fontographer? It can export MacOS suitcases (do those still work?) as well as BDFs which can be embedded in Windows TT fonts using SBIT.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
