If their database was much more complete (more fonts), would this single-function widget with a search field be valuable to any graphic designers here? It seems like it would be more useful if it included functions like their [Font Associator](http://web.archive.org/web/20071124184711/http:/www.typeindex.org/search_associator.php), but maybe that’s overkill for a mini-app?\n\n [‹ Garamond Premier Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20071124184711/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12216 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Graphic Designer vs Typographer ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071124184711/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15197 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
