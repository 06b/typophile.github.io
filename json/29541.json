An earthy dish, created by chance, with thirteen organic fonts. Quickly whisked up and devoured. It rarely took more than a few days from sketch to use/digestion by the project. Uncouth forms, erupted from the bowels of the earth. Shattered letters, branded, stressed, humiliated. In order to produce arrogant fonts, far too expressive to last on a page of copy text. Quite indisputably from nature. Still roughly hewn. Raw. Imperfect.\n\nThe second course formed a strong contrast: tight concept, linear work, disciplined preparation. In most cases the font was formed by a matrix. Digital cool, sober, reduced. Plenty of free scope, like chess: the board is always the same, the moves always different. Classic openings are followed by unfamiliar variants. Competitive games. Finely nuanced movements. Carefully thought out, one masterminded brainchild after another.\n\nDessert: mathematical severity is rounded off and smoothed down. Fonts between digital and analogue. Straightened rivers - the surfaces of our times.\n\nCoffee & Cigarettes: a journey through metropoles all around the globe and a interdisciplinary book project, reflecting the cultural sampling, crossing and mixing. Many designers contributed with experimental fonts and font families to the [BASTARD](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/www.bastard-project.com/) book project.\n\nFonts at Volcano Type have been designed by:  \n [Sandra Augstein](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Sandra%20Augstein)  \n [Peter Brugger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Peter%20Brugger)  \n [Stefan Claudius](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Stefan%20Claudius)  \n [Eduardo Escobar](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Eduardo%20Escobar)  \n [Florian Gärtner](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Florian%20G%C3%A4rtner)  \n [Sirkka Hammer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Sirkka%20Hammer)  \n [Lars Harmsen](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lars%20Harmsen)  \n [Martina Hartmann](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Martina%20Hartmann)  \n [Sandra Hofacker](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Sandra%20Hofacker)  \n [David Hubner](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/David%20Hubner)  \n [Boris Kahl](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Boris%20Kahl)  \n [Matthias Kantereit](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Matthias%20Kantereit)  \n [Ingo Krepinsky](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Ingo%20Krepinsky)  \n [Heinrich Lischka](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Heinrich%20Lischka)  \n [Michel M.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Michel%20M.)  \n [Thomas Mettendorf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Thomas%20Mettendorf)  \n [Christoph Rankers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Christoph%20Rankers)  \n [Dan Reynolds](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Dan%20Reynolds)  \n [Andre Rösler](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Andre%20R%C3%B6sler)  \n [Christoph Seiler](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Christoph%20Seiler)  \n [René Verkaart](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Ren%C3%A9%20Verkaart)\n\nPlus some design collaborations:  \nLars Harmsen, Boris Kahl  \nLars Harmsen, Henri Roussier  \nLars Harmsen, Boris Kahl, Ulrich Weiss, Nikolai Renger  \nPaul Hoppe, Boris Kahl  \nHeidrun Weißschädel, Alexander Kassel\n\nFontcatalogues and a DVD with fonts free for layout, can be found within these publications:  \n [VERSUS](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/www.magma-ka.de/Order/Versus), published by ”die gestalten“ (2004)  \n [BASTARD](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/www.bastard-project.com/), published by ACTAR (2006)\n\n[Volcano Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/www.volcano-type.de/index.html) fonts are available through [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000131/http:/www.myfonts.com/)\n\n",
