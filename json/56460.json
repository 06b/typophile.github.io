  "content": "Fellow Typophiles,\n\nI'm looking for a font viewing program that supports true type, open type, and postscript for a PC. I'm using [Font Xplorer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023195909/http:/www.moonsoftware.com/fxplorer.asp) and [AMP Font Viewer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023195909/http:/www.ampsoft.net/utilities/FontViewer.php) but curious what everyone else is using. Thanks for your help.\n\n",
