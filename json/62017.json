For all intents and purposes it is a green-screen version of their top-end Cascade model.\n\nAnyway... I really like the font they use for the user interface, it comes in a couple of weights and sizes. It's quite small but remains legible easily at a glance. I'd love to know who created it or how much work went into it.\n\nSo, recently I took a little time and created a version of the bold weight using FontStruct. It turned out well, so I'll try to create the normal weight when I manage to collect enough samples of it in use.\n\n[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/becker\\_bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20120611235237/http:/fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/becker_bold \"http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/becker\\_bold\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120611235237im_/http:/typophile.com/files/becker-bold_4716.png)\n\n",
