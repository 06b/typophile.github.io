In North America the rink size is approximately 200 feet long by 85 feet wide. Older rinks like the old Boston Garden were smaller and not consistent between buildings. This makes the international rink wider by approximately 15 feet.\n\nThese narrow NA rinks make for a more congested ice surface. The international surface makes for a more exciting game and for the player it provides more room for an attacking style of play.\n\n",

Mine was more real and probably signed by an admin or something since his signature sometimes looks different. I also have had to work on my signature since I've had a few students ask for it. I can't just sign it like you would for a cheque.\n\nOh, just saw and ad on NASN (north american sports network by setanta sports) that Boston is playing Montreal on Tuesday!!! yay...\n\nI've recently had my front tooth redone, and noticed my three scars don't show up as bad as they use too.\n\n"
