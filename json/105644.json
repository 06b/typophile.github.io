In FireFox and Internet Explorer the … : and ; do show how they supposed to look. For example the triple dots are reduced to just 1 dot.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419170948im_/http:/typophile.com/files/chrome_vs_firefox_5679.png)\n\nI use @font-face in the CSS code and the original OTF (from Glyph App on the Mac). So I assume there is nothing wrong with font file, and nothing went wrong in convertng becauce nothing was converted :-)\n\nWhat can be causing this strange problem? Anyone?\n\nDaan\n\n",
