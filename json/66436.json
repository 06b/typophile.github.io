(see small image below)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015055540im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cc_4393.png)\n\nI'm interested in specifically this style as well as general type work from this era, if you guys know of anything off the top of your head that is related, I'd really like to see it! or a link to a previous thread, specific style names, etc..\n\nThanks!\n\n",
