  "content": "As part of a research project for school I'm going to be designing and then producing woodtype using a laser engraver. I'm wondering how best to approximate the traditional size of the wood block surrounding each letter.\n\nI know that the 1000 UPM is essentially defining the vertical dimensions of the letter block, but, how do I determine where to place the letter vertically? That is, how do I determine how far above the cap-height, or ascender height, the edge of the type block is? Also, I am wondering if the left and right sidebearing measurements equate to the left and right sides of the block. At first guess, that would appear to be where those measurements come from, but I could be wrong and would prefer to know for sure.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100825012931im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture14_5636.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Jason,\n\nin digital fonts, the body of the letter (the block) is intangible. It is only a scaling measure.\n\nThe linespacing is determined by the ascender and the descender. In many text fonts, however, the sum of ascender and descender equals the body size (i.e. the UPM size, i.e. the point size). In other words, such fonts produce 10 pt type on a 10 pt leading when set solid (with no extra leading). So you could use the ascender and descender lines to determine the vertical size of the block. However, keep in mind that diacritics or tall elements of a face may hang over the vertical boundaries of the body, just like the kern of the italic f typically hangs over the horizontal boundaries of the body.\n\nA.\n\n"

      "content": "Are you planning on using it on a letterpress? If so you need to keep in mind that the type height (the thickness of the block, so from the bottom of the block to the top surface of the letter) has to be a certain value, otherwise it won't print.\n\nI don't know exactly how high though (since this is sometimes different in other countries). Overhere it's usually measured in augustijn (= 1 cicero = 12 _didot_ points). If I'm not mistaken (it has been a long time since I did letterpress printing) the type height is also measured in these units. I believe the UK/US used Pica, which is 12 points.\n\nIn any case, I would just get some woodtype, and start measuring some things, like what the type height must be. Look how they aswered the questions you have in your post, too, like the vertical placement of the letters on the block.\n\n"

      "content": "For metal type, the position of the baseline was standardized at the end of the 19th century, although there was more than one standard (\"art line\" allowed for longer descenders than usual). Of course, this position is dependent also on the point size.\n\nThe amount of depth is referred to as \"type high.\" I read that the value is 23.3 mm, or 0.9186\". I think there may have been a competing standard for this in Europe, however.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Whatever all that stuff is called in English. If the type is too low, it will not touch the paper.\n\n"
