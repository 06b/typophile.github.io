I am also attaching a docx file containing the same text in Arab Typesetting font, as well as in free Scheherazade font and Adobe Naskh medium font, so their team can check it quickly.\n\nThis bug was not present in Word 2010. The image shows the bug that how digits placement is disturbed over certain Arabic signs.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415084557im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Word%202013%20Bug_6183.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Word 2013 Bug.doc](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415084557/http:/typophile.com/files/Word%202013%20Bug_0.doc) | 17.32 KB |\n\n",
