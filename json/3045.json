Maybe some of you can suggest better/additional items?   \n   \n   \nThese are the Twelve Warning Signs that you may be a Fontoholic (alt. spelling: Fontaholic):   \n   \n1. You dream about fonts.   \n   \n2. You tell other people (who could not care less) what font the menu is set in.   \n   \n3. You look at magazine ads to identify the fonts.   \n   \n4. You know the urls of over 10 font sites by heart.   \n   \n5. Your copies of font books are falling apart from being used.   \n   \n6. You know the names of over 20 type designers.   \n   \n7. You name things after your favorite fonts.   \n   \n8. It ruins your day when you can't think of the name of a font you KNOW you know.   \n   \n9. You hang out all day waiting for ID posts at newsgroups and forums online.   \n   \n10. You need to buy a bigger hard drive to house your font collection.   \n   \n11. You spend days developing elaborate font classification schemes for your font files.   \n   \n12. You hate it when you know a font, but someone ID's it before you do.\n\n"

It ruins a movie for you when they use a typeface that didn't exist at the time the movie is supposed to take place.   \n   \n15. You can page through a 2-inch-thick font catalog without falling asleep.   \n   \n16. The first thing you do when you go to a used or rare book store is check to see if they have any type specimen books.   \n   \n17. You find it difficult to read sometimes because you're noticing the typeface.\n\n"

And everytime I go \"Look! Futura Extra Bold!\" or \"Hey, it's Gill Sans again!\" my girlfriend acts like she doesn't know me. \\*Sigh\\*   \n   \nAnother one that happens all the time:   \n   \n- People stare at you in disbelief for being an illiterate in these times when all you do is get a really close/long look at the poster/billboard (to figure out if it's Helvetica Condensed or Franklin Gothic)\n\n"
