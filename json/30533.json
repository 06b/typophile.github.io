Now I realize how dependant I have become to choose different weights depending on compositions and not having choices is really annoying. Does anyone know if they are planning on releasing different weights ever?\n\nOr if the fonts were going to be used for a logo, how hard do you think it would be to give them more weight by hand?\n\n",
