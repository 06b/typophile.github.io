  "content": "For all FontLab users out there who hate building numbered lists for FontLab encoding files, especially as glyph complements are getting bigger and bigger.\n\nWe have just updated a tool that helps to manipulate text lists of glyph names. With it you can renumber a sequence of glyphs using a new text file of glyph names or an existing FL encoding file.\n\nThe tool will pick out the first word of each line in the text file and re-apply the encoding sequence starting with the number you give. You can leave empty blocks or incorporate dummy sequences using the codes shown.\n\nWARNING  \nNever use it on a FontLab encoding file in the Encodings folder, always use a duplicate.\n\nIt's not much but it helps us, so we are sharing it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130319091233im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ScreenGrab_4177.jpg)\n\nDownload the Mac Version [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130319091233/http:/www.dtptypes.co.uk/flencodings/FLencodingsMac.zip)  \nDownload the Windows version [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130319091233/http:/www.dtptypes.co.uk/flencodings/FLencodingsWin.zip)  \nUser:fluser  \nPassword:flencodings\n\nAll comments and suggestions are welcome at [mail@dtptypes.com](mailto:mail@dtptypes.com) but please remember you use the software at your own risk.\n\n",

Now I can bin the clumsy spreadsheet I had been using for this purpose.\n\nJust a little cosmetic \"feature request\": Would it be possible not to give empty lines a number (but still increase the count)? The only effect would be that in FontLab these cells would get the caption \"---\" instead of the number, which helps when you use them as intentionally empty \"spacers\".\n\n"
