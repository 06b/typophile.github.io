      "content": "I think BJs concept of heavy and thin weights in the type is perfect. Lose the map and tape measure and create a clever typographical logo. As BJ suggested, work the type using bold and light. Maybe it's a progression (or maybe more appropriately regression) from Black to Heavy/Bold to Regular/Roman to Thin/Light, etc. Maybe the distinction is within the letters of \"Connecticut\" or maybe it is made from word to word. Or maybe the effect is only present in the words \"Weight Loss\". Try it and see what you come up with.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

      "content": "Lund, I have to agree with Scott & bj. It might be better to develop a pure typographic logo.   \n   \nEven if you insist to use a pictorial elements, than they probably should be more logo-like. (There is a functional point as well: imagine this photo on a fax or photocopy).   \n   \nMaybe you should also try to make the type more compact. Right now it seems that those letters have just been typed, not really \"designed\".   \n   \nMaybe the feeling of this logo is too \"Clinic\" and not enough \"Weight Loss\". Honestly, it is not just about health, is it?\n\n"
