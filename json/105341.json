      "content": "There is no need for external photo editors, Find my Font contains an interactive perspective correction tool, especially for these cases (it's the tool marked with \"ABC\").  \nYou hold down the shift key to move the 4 corners of the tool to appropriate position, check the \"Fix Perspective\" checkbox [x] and click on [OK] button - that's all.  \nYou get a perspective-corrected copy of the selected image and you can then select the letters you wish as usual.
