      "content": "The t defiantly catches the eye, this is fine in larger display settings for me. I was actually directly comparing it with Aller earlier today. I'm looking for something for a client who wants the be the 'fresh' and 'edgy' cliche (although I do like their genuine attitude). I was favouring Colaborate because of its thin face and ability to have a lot of contrast with the bold. I personally like Aller better except the blocky serif (is there a name for this?) on top of the i and j annoy me a bit. I think it works better on the capital J. The a, b, g and l are what I really enjoy. The italics have a nice treatment too.\n\n"
