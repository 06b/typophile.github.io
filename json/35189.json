These are dead on and give me the flexibility I’m looking for since Goldenbook is better for display.  \nLove ITC Golden Cockerel, so perfect.\n\nHeller’s book is great. I don’t have that copy. Will have to ebay it.\n\nWhat other faces do you guys think would look good for a type family?  \nThinking Old Newspaper faces as well.\n\nBTW, the best thing about this Harry Potter was the newspaper design!\n\n"

      "content": "If you want to do this properly, acquire some magazines from that era at old paper stores/markets, and a copy of “American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century” by Matt McGrew (Oak Knoll), which will enable you to identify the faces. You’ll find that the 20s and 30s were radically different — going from illustration and historicism to photography and modernism. Knockout and Belizio are 19th century styles.\n\nBroadway (Inline) is one of the most Art Deco faces, so is Radiant, which has a useful condensed. Bernhard Gothic and Kabel are more deco than Futura. Deco slabs (Stymie, Rockwell) are very different from the Egyptians — round curves and not much stroke contrast. See Keith Tam’s essay on this at Type Culture.com. Bodonis — especially the dark weights — were exemplary Deco faces.\n\n"

I’m going to get the McGrew book right away.\n\nI have Bernhard Gothic and love Futura. Have Rockwell but enjoy Egyptians much more.\n\nBeen collecting samples on Ebay. Other than Gallagher’s in New York, do you know of other vintage paper collectible resources?\n\nThanks again!\n\nBest,  \nMia\n\n"

Good luck!\n\n"
