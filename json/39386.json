  "content": "Hi,\n\nI made this image as a signature for a message board, but I need to redo it because it turns out I was mistaken about having permission to use the background. Unfortunately I can’t remember what font I used for my name (“Michelle”). I know I got it from some free font site, or else it was already installed on my computer. (I am using a new computer now, of course. Sigh.) It can’t be too uncommon a font since I am usually too lazy to look very long for a font I like.\n\nOh, the drop shadow is not part of the font; I added that. I really appreciate any help you can give me!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071231134030im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cm_aisling_5987.png)\n\n [‹ DA Designer signage (tiny sample)](http://web.archive.org/web/20071231134030/http:/typophile.com/node/39319 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Fonts in Cadbury commercial - Hanseatic, Sauna {Mikey D} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071231134030/http:/typophile.com/node/39384 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
