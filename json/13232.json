I suspect this is because typefounding has its roots in the guild tradition, in which master craftsmen were deeply reluctant to share their trade secrets. (There’s an anecdote about young Joseph Jackson, apprenticed to William Caslon, learning his trade by boring a hole through the master’s wall; this sums it up.) Christopher Plantin’s “Dialogues,” which purport to explain type design to the lay public, are riddled with intentional errors (though the book is still a good read), and Joseph Moxon’s “Mechanick Exercises” is similarly oblique by design.\n\nThere are a lot of personal monographs about lettering, even more about typefounding, but only occasional writings about typeface design that are really on point. I really like Fred Smeijers books, [“Counterpunch”](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006112502/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0907259065/typographycom-20) especially (it’s a farrago of ideas, every bit as thoughtful, inventive and thorough as Fred himself), but it’s not really a manual about how to design fonts. Gerrit Noordzij’s books are also great, of which [“Letterletter”](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006112502/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/088179175X/typographycom-20) may be the one that’s of greatest practical use to someone wanting to learn how to design typefaces. You can generally find Dwiggins’ things through inter-library loan, and both “WAD to RR: A letter about designing type” and “Layout in Advertising” (ignore the misleading title) offer some genuine insights.\n\n\\> is there a chance that you and other type designers  \n\\> will develop a deep course about type design\n\nA lot of type designers do teach courses on type design. Tobias Frere-Jones and Matthew Carter co-teach an excellent class in the Yale MFA program, and I’m always impressed by the students’ output: more than just drawing good letters, they really learn to develop the kind of clarity of purpose that makes a good typeface. Cyrus Highsmith teaches a type design class at RISD, Erik van Blokland teaches at KABK in The Hague, and Gerry Leonidas runs an outstanding program in Reading — we’ve hired type designers out of all of these programs. If you’re interested in type design and thinking about going back to school, I’d really encourage you to talk to one of these folks about their programs.\n\nA lot of type designers also participate in workshops. Jean-François Porchez leads workshops in a variety of places, and the guys from Underware host a travelling workshop that looks every bit as exciting as their fonts are. Most accessibly, many type conferences have a parallel “hands-on” track in which accomplished type designers teach their specialties. (This year’s TypeCon in New York has everyone from John Downer to Ken Barber teaching a workshop — go.) At Type-90 in Oxford, I got to embarass myself in both Fud Benson’s stonecutting class and John Downer’s gold leaf workshop, and I learned quite a lot in the process.\n\n\\> As a side note...\n\nEric, we’ve already got a nice housekeeper at the office, and since we’re in SoHo it’s safe to assume that there’s already someone sleeping on the doorstep. But if you’re ever interested in working here, feel free to drop me a line. We don’t have any openings right now, but if you’d like to send a resume or some work to careers(a)typography.com, I’d be happy to check it out.\n\n"

The term hints at an idea of “completion” without the definitive concept of “the end”.\n\nI think the same goes for type design. A typeface is never “finished.” Rather, it reaches a point in its development when it is ready to be used and applied and appreciated; when the designer sees his/her intention fulfilled in physicality and ready to be shared.\n\n“Clarity of purpose”, as I understand it, would be the investment and transparency of the inner logic of a typeface... a state of wholeness that appeases the assessment of a trained eye.\n\nPerhaps there are elements of biography and history to be added to it as well, but at the level of craftsmanship, these factors may be negligible.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>Clarity of purpose:\n\nA font is a physical entity, part artefact, part tool.  \nA typeface is more than that.\n\nA typeface contains an innate physical quality, a syntactic vocabulary of interacting elements: contrast, stress, proportion, color, curve-type, serif style, finish, etc. These construct the personality of the typeface, which is further expressed in the craftsmanship of the font. When all these are strong and work together, there is synergy, and a clarity of purpose.\n\nOnce a typeface has been used sufficiently (however that is defined) in the culture, it becomes a collective archetype: everyone knows what the “Bodoni” quality is, for instance.  \nWhen people see a typeface used in fitting ways, for certain kinds of work, with perhaps the authority of certain typographers or typographic schools channeling it towards specific kinds of settings (one thinks of Interstate bold condensed, in newspapers), that becomes a justification, a confirmation of the original clarity of purpose.\n\nSuccessful design is purposeful; everything is there for a reason.  \nTypefaces that are casually derived from others, either by tracing scans or re-using bezier paths (and metrics) lack purpose, because the re-worker is merely repeating shapes (like mouthing a foreign language phonetically) and has little concept of the underlying syntax and vocabulary, of why it looks the way it does, of what it means.\n\n"

Remember, his roots were deep in creating corporate identities and the development of glyph/symbols as language.\n\nHis feelings for type designers was based less on the craft and more about ideas:\n\n_A dialogue is constantly in progress with great typographers from the past such as Garamond, Bodoni, Baskerville, Walbaum, and with the great typographers of today such as Gill, Morison or Frutiger.
