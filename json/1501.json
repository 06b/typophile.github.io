  "content": "Hey all you Seattle people, I am curating a local event called BD4D - By Designers for Designers. BD4D seeks to create an atmosphere where designers can share their work in a fun and relaxed atmosphere. But what's even more important, it's FREE. Previous events have been held in London, Manchester, Sydney, Paris, LA, and New York, establishing BD4D as one of the world's foremost designer gatherings.   \n   \nBD4D is broken up into two segments. The first is 3MM (three minute madness) where a designer or studio is invited to present their work in around three minutes. Usually, this consists of focusing in on one specific piece or site. The Featured presenters have roughly 30 minutes on the stage to display and discuss a broad range of their work. Each presentations is followed by a QA session where audience members have the opportunity to question the designers on their presentations, or   \nwork in general.   \n   \nThe Seattle event will be hosted at the Henry Art Gallery ( [http://www.henryart.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020175301/http:/www.henryart.org/)) on Friday, October 3. Doors open at 6:30pm, but I encourage everyone to arrive early, as space is limited, and we have no idea how many people will be attending.   \n   \nI want to invite you to come see/meet the great speakers we have lined up, as well as other creatives in attendance.
