I’m having a bit of difficulty with a logo I am creating. It is a personal project of mine, and I am having trouble with font weights.\n\nI am a college student, and I am starting my own personal online portfolio. I do a bit of freelance work, and I would like to get my name out there. These are the first drafts of my logo, and this was one direction I was considering going in.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122012104im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/wonderpixel_3453.png)\n\nI’m a bit fond of the squares, but for some reason they look awkward to me. However, I am in love with the font (Gotham).\n\nI also played with the idea of using a ’super-hero’ looking logo with a shield and a big bold ’W’ with the url of my website-to-be underneath as a tagline. I don’t see this done very often, and it might be a fun idea to play around with.\n\nSuggestions?\n\n [‹ Photographers Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122012104/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47644 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [connect.com ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122012104/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48062 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I also do a bit of website design, specializing in interactive flash layouts. I don’t do a whole lot of branding or work with logo design/illustration, but that is the direction that I would eventually like to go in.\n\nI’m a Sophomore in college (going for a degree in Graphic Design) and I’m taking typography, digital web design and mass media production in the fall semester, so hopefully I’ll get some good experience then.\n\nHopefully this information will make it easier to critique my design\n\n"

Also, your kerning is all over the place, although maybe you just quickly posted these mock-ups to give up some idea of your direction.\n\nI think overall it’s a bit static, and doesn’t evoke enough of a sense of “wonder” or “pixel.” The colors are nice, though.\n\nA few questions:\n\nWhat does it look like in black and white?  \nDid you start with pencil and paper?\n\n—  \nNick Hladek\n\n"

It’s pretty messy, I did it with a purple marker.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122012104im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/wp_5450.png)\n\nThis also shows some ideas with the ’Superhero’ look. I think I might explore that a little.\n\n"

      "content": "I always love to see sketches on paper.  \nIf I may comment on your sketches first?\n\n1. Use normal sketching paper with no lines on it.  \n2. Don’t crowd your sketches. Leave space around them. That way you can better judge them.\n\nFrom here I feel you are a bit ’afraid’ of sketching.  \nIf these are all of your sketches, you have started to soon behind the computer.  \nYou didn’t explore all you could.  \nForce yourself to make more sketches. When you think you are ready to jump to the computer. DON’T. Put it asside and look at it the next day and continue sketching.\n\nAbout your post.  \nFirst, you are not sure on the different weights.(I do agree about the kerning)  \nLooking trough my brows (put aside the ’pixels’ in front of it) I can see that the bottom two are not in balance. ’Wonder’ is too heavy in both of them. If that is what your intention was ... well done. If not. Too heavy.\n\nThe first one tickels me the most. It has a modern, webby feel to it. Nothing fancy though.\n\nI was wondering what happens if you place either of them in small caps?\n\nAbout the pixel-logo.  \nLike I mentioned before. You started to soon behind the computer. There is more potential in this name.  \nI think you didn’t find it and perhaps you feel it too and that is why it doesn’t feel that right to you.\n\nMy advice: don’t concentrate on the type yet. First make sure you have a solid concept and go further with that. I’m sure you will come up with something better!\n\nPersonaly I like the colors.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nSorry for my long post.\n\nUugh.\n\nRay\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for all the feedback bobby, and you’re right. I’m not super comfortable with sketching, as I often do preliminaries on the computer. I was also wary about the heavier weights of the bottom few, but the bottom one and the first one ended up being my favorites. I like the contrast in the first, and the fifth feels the most lively. I still haven’t decided between them, but I most definitely think that I want to make ’wonder’ as prominent (or moreso) than ’pixel’, as wonder is a much more emphatic and memorable word.\n\nI did a few more mock-ups, but I think I will go pack to pen-and-paper and try to clean up and refine a few sketches.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122012104im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/wp02_3756.png)\n\nI was also considering the word pixel in a pixel-esque font.

I also considered putting it at the end. This is to stand for curiosity or wonderment, both synonyms of the word wonder.  \nAnd number five is wonderpixel with a magic wand replacing the i.\n\nOn the right side are sketches of marks, but I am really thinking that most of the marks just clutter it. The ideas I am fondest of are 3 and 4, and I really don’t think the magic wand is working, but I am excited to hear your ideas on how to expand!\n\nAlso, I noticed that a synonym of wonder is puzzle. Not the noun form, but I’m thinking maybe puzzle pieces instead of ’pixels’. Though, I’m not sure if it would be the best solution.\n\n"

It also adds to ’wonder’.\n\nBut I think it comes down to choosing the right font.\n\nYou said that wonder is synonym for puzzle, perhaps you can incorporate this into the lay-out of the logo?  \nI think if you choose for number three, no additional logo is needed.  \nIt speaks for itself.\n\nGood work!\n\nRay\n\n"

I like number 3, although instead of pixelating “pixel,” what if you had the word “wonder” plixelated, and then moving from left to right, you would remove pixels here and there, removing more as you moved right. It would give the sense of the word falling apart and dissolving, which would give suggest the relationship between abstract and concrete. Then put “pixel” underneath “wonder” in solid type to give a sense of grounding and conceptual contrast.\n\n—  \nNick Hladek\n\n"
