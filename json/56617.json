      "content": "This is indeed a problematic unification, bit disunification can be even more problematic, as we discovered with the Romanian diacritics. In which direction would you disunify? What would be the identity of the existing codepoint? — bearing in mind that it is part of ISO Latin 1 as the florin, and widely implemented as such in fonts, but has normative case folding to the uppercase F-hook?\n\nI believe a significant identity shift is already beginning to take place vis à vis this character. As more font support extended Latin character sets including support for African languages, the obvious implementation of this character is as f-hook, rather than as the florin symbol. We’ve already started changing the implementation in fonts for MS as we extend the character set to support African language. And of course the demise of the Dutch currency in favour of the euro makes this change easier.\n\n"

      "content": "Though the Dutch florin has been obsolesced by the euro, aren’t there other countries that use a currency called “florin”, whether or not the same symbol is used? Something in my mind says there is at least one, but I can’t pull it out.\n\nIf not, the remaining future use of the florin symbol will be largely limited to texts on Dutch financial history and other period pieces, e.g.: a romantic comedy set in a Rotterdam grocery store in 1987, which a careful editor can easily fake with an italic _f_ with hook from future disambiguated fonts.\n\n"
