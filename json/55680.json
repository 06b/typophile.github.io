My specimen books did not turn up anything and neither did linotypes font-identifier.I even went through the whole sans-serif list on dafont, still nothing. Can anyone help me out with a name on this one?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106205927im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Klosterfont_3500.png)\n\n",

The ‘a’ reminds me of Steile Futura aka [Tasse](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106205927/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Tasse).  \nF\n\n"
