I also have another of Aicher's obscure books named _In Rotis_, which has nothing to do with the \"super type family\" Rotis, but about the mini-think-tank he ran near his residence in Rotis in the Allgäu region of Germany. (Both of his books were inscribed to me saying something like \"Norbert -- for the time you spent here in Rotis\" or so he said. It probably said, \"Nobert -- now go on and get out of here you little doofus!\" since I still can't read his writing.)\n\nI spent a couple of years going back and forth from Massachusetts to Germany working with Otl Aicher during his development of Rotis type family.\n\nHere are a couple of links that might lead to additional works by Aicher.

A philosopher in spirit who was shackled by his \"sense\" of order. He called for revolution in design and typography, but adhered to the grid (anti-nature) in distrust of chaos.\n\nHe admired Adrian Frutiger immensely and one can undoubtably see how Univers influenced the Rotis matrix.\n\nIf one reads deeper into Aicher's _Typographie_, one will see Aicher's concepts as being less typographic (relating to type design and type layout) and more involved with humans within a rapidly changing environment in need of new symbology and notation systems.\n\nThere are some aspects to the Rotis forms that I find interesting, but most of the weights leave me cold... from the first time I saw initial test through the release and promotional material.\n\nBy the time the entire Rotis family was available for sale, my job had less to do with type promotion, so I never really spent much time setting the faces and learning what unique and usable aspects could be exploited.\n\nI am far more an admirer of Herr Aicher than Rotis the type family (Rotis the village was idyllic) and will eventually share more of my experiences and learning from Otl Aicher.\n\n"

Even if Hochuli did not mention  \nAicher, at the time this text was published first, everybody knew to which book  \nHochuli was referring to. (I do not have 'Designing books' here with me,  \nI am quoting out of my memory. The exact words of this critical comment  \nshould be in 'Designing books' somewhere between page 12 and 14.)\n\nAicher's writing is very critical about any style or superficial aesthetics in design  \nand never lacks a certain polemic note.\n\nThe questions Aicher raises are sometimes more interesting than his answers  \nto these questions.\n\nIt would be a little bit unfair to judge Aicher only by looking at Rotis,  \nand by doing so one would cut oneself off from the opportunity  \nof coming to know his design philosophy which always revolves round  \nthe question of the designer's responsibility. His strong moral point of view  \nalso traces back from his experiences in Nazi-Germany where he was in contact  \nwith the resistance group Weisse Rosearound Sophie Scholl.\n\nAichers design for the Olympic games 1972 (and his pictograms)  \nbrought him world wide recognition.\n\nThere was a time when Aicher had acquired an almost guru-like status  \n(especially when he just had had been killed by an accident.  \nUntimely death can boost popularity and helps building instant-saints).  \nThis led of course to a counter-movement amongst some designers  \nwho argued that Aicher had confused ideology with design.  \nUsing or rejecting Rotis was for a certain time at least in Germany  \nand other German speaking countries -  \na demonstration whether one was pro or contra Aicher.  \nThis time of hysteria is luckily over.  \nOne can only hope that now Aicher's achievements  \n(as well as the limitations of his approach are there any?

      "content": "\\> _Hi,  \nI’m looking for info about Otl Aicher (in english)._\n\nGetting back to the original request -- you might find this extremely informative in regards to Aicher's philosophy and process during the major corporate rebranding of FSB and ERCO (both in mid-eighties), with personal recollections by Juergen W. Braun.\n\n[PDF: http://www.id.iit.edu/~mebert/aicher.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124092613/http:/www.id.iit.edu/~mebert/aicher.pdf)  \nMartin Ebert  \nDesign Policy  \nID 515  \nProfessor John Heskett  \nInstitute of Design  \nIllinois Institute of Technology  \nSpring 1997  \n-------------------------------------\n\nI also started the process of gathering some of my own personal notes and correspondences related to period Aicher was in process of publishing _Typographie_ and the development of Rotis type family. My intent is only to fill some critical facts which seem forgotten or lacking on the information, theories and criticism associated with Rotis.\n\nIt's important to know that the preparation and publishing of _Typographie_ was happening simultaneously with the development of the Rotis typefaces. Aicher was commissioned to compile a record of his typographic experiences by Klaus Maack of Druckhaus Maack (major printshop in Germany since 1849), who also happened to be the CEO of [**ERCO**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124092613/http:/www.erco.com/), the major high-end lighting manufacturer that Aicher was rebranding (with Rotis).\n\n------------------------------------  \n\\> _One thing to remember about Rotis is that it was Aicher’s first font._\n\nFYI -- technically not his \"first\" but in actuality Rotis was his only type design effort, due to his untimely death.\n\n[spiekerblog -- Erik Spiekermann](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124092613/http:/www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C1109747452/E1829097339/index.html)  \n\"Aicher certainly didn’t do himself a favour by aiming so high with his first proper type design (he had previously adapted Univers for Bulthaupt and the Traffic typeface for Munich airport).\"\n\n"

      "content": "I have just finished reading 'typographie' today. I have been working through it this last week. First-off, the English translation in Rotis Roman \\*wasn't\\* difficult to read. It has been the first time I had read Rotis (Roman) in any quantity. There is an example in the book later on which shows the comparison between Rotis Roman and Times Roman and it becomes clear that Times is a significant influence from the Roman end of the scale.\n\nThe book lays out a \\*Big\\* argument about the adoption of capitalis by the Romans (and later Renaisance) with the usage of Capitalis' drawing an association to vacuous superiority. This is both interesting and enlightening as this had not been apparent, though subconsciously obvious.\n\nTypographie, the Book is a fine example of 'Total Design' in the true Dutch sense, where all aspects of the design work in a holistic way (typeface, illustration style page make-up). The only aspect of the book design that bugged me was a really tight gutter margin and some bad column return alliterations.\n\nI have always admired what I have seen of Aicher's work and have his Sahara Desert book and essays (English and German) so am looking forward to the book from Markus Rathgeb.\n\nRotis as a font is a remarkable undertaking. I really like the concept of legibility being increased upon the increased distinction between letterforms and admire the notion of being inspired by pen-forms and early type design, especially the Garamond lowercase e (Carolingian minuscule). If we were to take these to starting points - would we end up with something so successful as Rotis, perhaps? But what is commendable is having the ideas and working them out and creating a font programme of 17 variants. It can be criticised but has yet to be superseded. I believe this is suggested as the eternal challenge to the typographer anyhow.\n\nI wish I had read it years ago. An important book!\n\n/hernan\n\n"

Everything is geared up to this point.\n\n"
