  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI've been looking for different ligatures for a school project and found this typeface...I just can't seem to figure out what it is, but I think it looks very elegant, subtle yet contemporary.\n\nThese examples are designed by Red Design for Gresham Blake (you can see the full photo on their website [http://www.red-design.co.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014000935/http:/www.red-design.co.uk/ \"http://www.red-design.co.uk/\") - still - gresham blake).\n\nDid Red Design make this themselves or is it an exsisting typeface?  \nif it is an exsisting one, would anyone know the name of it and where I could buy it?\n\nthank you very much!\n\ngrtz,  \ndav2.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [love honour6.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014000935/http:/typophile.com/files/love%20honour6.jpg) | 17.61 KB |\n| [love honour1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014000935/http:/typophile.com/files/love%20honour1.jpg) | 20.21 KB |\n| [love honour5.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014000935/http:/typophile.com/files/love%20honour5.jpg) | 17.91 KB |\n\n",

Or would you think it's an exsisting font still?\n\nIt's quite hard to see the details of the bjork book. I think I'll just send an email to Red Design, they should be able to tell me, right?\n\n"
