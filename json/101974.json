  "content": "I Currently work for a company that asked me to update their logo, number one reason for it that current logo is not very readable.\n\nSince current logo been used for a few years now, I would like to preserve some of it's qualities such as overlapping letters and an \"i\" tittle at the end. Original logo is a heavily squished Arial.\n\nI am having seconds thoughts regarding this direction, and considering designing a brand new logo. I understand that attached still need polishing, but would like to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [soti.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415182933/http:/typophile.com/files/soti.jpg) | 23.25 KB |\n\n",

Perhaps the key lies in finding a natural connection between the letterforms. If I by any chance can be of help, feel free to contact me via my profile.\n\n"

Alternatively, the O could be made narrower, but then its squarish shape really stands out and in a good way, so I'd adjust the rest to play along with it and not the other way around. Overall though, I think it's a great improvement over a cluttered mess of the current logo.\n\n"

It's really good.\n\nThe O still dominates the wordmark, to a much lesser degree than before, but it does look bigger (wider) and heavier than the rest of the letters.\n\nI would also explore an option of rounding T's and I's corners a bit, because of SO looks very smooth and it's in a contrast with the straights and straight corners of the T and I.\n\n"

      "content": "Yes.  \nTo make this logo an \"evolution\" it should have at least something reminiscent of the old logo. As much as I like the latest type-only-no-tweaks logo I suppose it would benefit from a little detail.\n\nWhat I would suggest you to try is to cut the top part of /I/ to create a dot (just as high at the top bar of /T/ is) and position the dot to the right at the same vertical level and as much to the right as /T/ is from /I/. If that will be too far, you will maybe have to kern /TI/ pair to make it look harmonious. I think that would make the \"lovable\" part of this logo.\n\nOtherwise I really like these letter shapes. Nice, bit poetic but still strong and with character. Nice choice. But about letter shapes. /O/ would benefit from some _lighting_. It feels heavier than other letters. So you either adjust the weight of other three letters or adjust the /O/ to have the same weight.\n\n"
