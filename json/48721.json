  "content": "I have just uploaded a PDF file with alternate lunate sigmas and epsilons.\n\nI extend my thanks to all those who have posted their comments and helped me so far with their critique.\n\nSemele is a book text typeface. Semele Book or Semele Regular are the weights to be finally used as book text typefaces with the relationship between the cap height and that of the acscenders and descenders readjusted; currently I am working on that.\n\nI would like to add that originally the Semele Latin characters were designed in such a way that they would be the basis for the subsequent design of Old Style Greek characters which — for book text usage in Greek Classical Typography — are always designed in a calligraphic way as in Monotype Greek Upright 90, Greek Times Ten, Times New Roman, Minion and other.\n\nAs the typeface will be also used as a Greek book text, its finalized name has come from Greek mythology. Semele (Σεμέλη) was one of the four daughters of Cadmus who was credited by Herodotus with the invention of the alphabet and other useful things.\n\nI would be very happy to read your further comments and critique.\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ThetisLight..pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/ThetisLight._0.pdf) | 21.05 KB |\n| [Semeli\\_Light\\_Roman\\_Version\\_9..pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Semeli_Light_Roman_Version_9._0.pdf) | 46.27 KB |\n| [AlternateDesignOfGreekCharacters.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/AlternateDesignOfGreekCharacters_0.pdf) | 174.03 KB |\n| [Thetis\\_Semele\\_LightItalic.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Thetis_Semele_LightItalic_0.pdf) | 24.85 KB |\n| [Which\\_o.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Which_o.pdf) | 13.15 KB |\n| [Semele(Thetis)GreekLightItalicTEXT.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Semele(Thetis)GreekLightItalicTEXT.pdf) | 127.17 KB |\n| [TheConsonantsAtLaw\\_Loeb\\_108163\\_mm1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/TheConsonantsAtLaw_Loeb_108163_mm1.pdf) | 39.11 KB |\n| [TheConsonantsAtLaw\\_Loeb\\_pages\\_394-397.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/TheConsonantsAtLaw_Loeb_pages_394-397.pdf) | 175.35 KB |\n| [Semeli(Thetis)LightRomanItalic\\_Version\\_10N.indd\\_.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Semeli(Thetis)LightRomanItalic_Version_10N.indd_.pdf) | 101.62 KB |\n| [Hypatia\\_Problem\\_313x331\\_mm.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Hypatia_Problem_313x331_mm.pdf) | 129.66 KB |\n| [Hypatia\\_Problem\\_170x242\\_mm.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Hypatia_Problem_170x242_mm.pdf) | 116.96 KB |\n| [Semeli(Thetis)LightRomanItalic\\_Version\\_15Na.indd\\_.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Semeli(Thetis)LightRomanItalic_Version_15Na.indd__0.pdf) | 108.26 KB |\n| [SemeleArchaicGreekLetters15N.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/SemeleArchaicGreekLetters15N.pdf) | 46.43 KB |\n| [SemeleArchaicGreekLettersWithVariants.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/SemeleArchaicGreekLettersWithVariants_0.pdf) | 54.01 KB |\n| [Semele Lunate Sigmas and Epsilons.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905/http:/typophile.com/files/Semele%20Lunate%20Sigmas%20and%20Epsilons.pdf) | 21.38 KB |\n\n",

Although I reversed the \"pen\" action for a more forward motion, though you accomplish this with flaring the stems. Not sure it matters much at text sizes. Here are some pointers, much of it preference:\n\n1. I wonder if the bowl and counter of the a shouldn't be more equally balanced.  \n2. crossbar of the F could come down a hair compared to E and right serif could be lengthened.  \n3. For a book type you may want a smaller x height (making the ascenders and descenders longer serves the same purpose).\n\n"

I have applied them all and I am posting now Thetis Light Version 2.0. In case you notice some more things to be fixed or improved please let me know.\n\nLooking at the numerals, I realized that number 3 may need to look more straight and it should be rotated 2-3 degress to the right. The upper horizontal strokes of 5 and 7 would look better if they were a little thicker. Numbers 2, 5, 6, and 8 should become more refined.

The closed counter (top) is too small vertically, and the bottom needs more width: the curve of the tail starts too early I think and the end doesn't go far enough left.\n\nF: crossbar even lower. Make the top of the F crossbar at the bottom of the E crossbar. Also the foot serif, right side make him wider or the whole letter will fall over to the right! Also helps a little with the white hole under the F.\n\ny: consider a bit more weight in the end of the tail.\n\nx: cut this stroke ( / ) in the middle and move the bottom left leg to the left maybe 20 em units.

Erato sounds like eratus to me, but this is a full body principal text so... Iphigenia..riiiiiiight. Ismene sounds like it'd be a formal script font. Leta sounds like Star Trek dabo girl, Leda, eh, too short in any case. Phoebe possible and Semele.... wait... perfect. Her Roman name is Stimula, which for a calligraphic Greek version could go perfect. Especially since the light version feels well, light, and agile which could definitely go with a name like Stimula so.... Semele it is. It has a nice timeless look, and the daughter of Semele (e.g. all documents set it in) was immortal. The only downside would be that Semele is not actually a Greek name, rather (again according to Wikipedia) Thraco-Phrygian which might have made it a better suited name for a non-Greek designer and I'm guessing by your profile you're Greek (side note: I could use a critique on my Greek font haha)\n\nIn any case, I think Semele works well. Above all to my ears it sounds the least girly-girl (read: Curlz) of the fonts and more like a nice robust formal font (think hot conservative librarian).\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que  \napenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

I especially like the small upturn that the E and F have.\n\nNow, as to your alternate characters, I think the f, j, and y should have the same terminal roughly. So you could keep f.1, the j, and y.2, but use a slightly thinner terminal on y.2. Or go with the ball terminal in f.2 and y.1 and make one for j.\n\nz.2 is the better of the Zs for this style, the other two seem a bit heavy since they're not descending.\n\nThe tail on m is thinner than the others.\n\nThe o seems to be slanted without getting its due stress. By that I mean, all the other bowls have or appear to have a diagonal stress, but the o looks like it has a vertical stress.\n\n2 gets too thing, and 4 might be a bit too thick on its diagonal.\n\nI like that the 3, 5, and 9 have different terminals, but since the rest of the font is consistent with its building blocks, I'd choose one of the three and use the same style. Personally I prefer 9's. 3's is a bit anemic.\n\nI'm guessing it's by design, but just to make sure you intended it, B, D, E, and L have stubbier serifs on their left stems than F, H, K, N, R, T.\n\nI hope that helps.

I have started working on them; also I am checking the ‘stubbier serifs’ inconsistencies between B, D, E, L and F, H, K, N, R, T in order to fix them.\n\nThere is one point about which I am not quite clear about.

If you keep is as it is then this particular curvy stroke must be redesigned to look somehow more calligraphic and or more uniformly drawn.\n\nThe tail of ‘Q’ could be mad a little more emphatic, maybe longer and more horizontal.\n\nI agree with Randy about the ‘a’, a.5 definitely is the best.\n\nNumeral ‘6’ looks a bit crude compared to the well designed and balanced ‘9’, also the bowl in ‘6’ should be 15-25 em higher than it is.\n\nNumeral ‘3’ needs skewing 2-3 units to the right as it looks as if it is tilted to the left.\n\nNumeral ‘2’ the curve-stroke part that joins with the horizontal bar at the baseline could be improved a little more.\n\nThat’s all for the moment.\n\nI am quite eager to take a look at the SemeleGreek, the roman and the Italic, could you please post them if they are ready.

      "content": "SemeleGreekLight Roman Version 10.0 - Some suggestions(Based partly on your AlternateDesignOfGreekCharacters PDF file attachment)\n\nThe pages 394-397 from Lucian’s ‘The Consonants at law’ that you uploaded are very nice, congratulations. You kept to the original layout as best as anyone could. You realize of course that (as Randy pointed out) SemeleLight isn’t good enough as a weight to use it as book text typeface, you will have to design also a Book or a Regular weight for that; also a Bold weight. The Cap height should be increased a little and correspondingly the height of the ascenders and descenders.\n\nIn relation to the overall design of the Semele Greek characters, admittedly the typeface is quite nice and polished, some characters are designed excellently and some others could be improved. I have found out that the only Greek typefaces that are universally accepted and admired are all those that are digitized from hot metal types designed by great masters such as Bodoni, Baskeville and others and some of the typefaces that you have in your PDF ‘AlternateDesignOfGreekCharacters’.  \nAll those typefaces have some of their letterform characteristics (hooks, blobs etc) enlarged in ways similar to the enlargement of facial characteristics in caricatures, this keeps the individual style of the typeface quite strong even at small point sizes, this is very important. In the Greek Semele these particular characteristics need to be strengthened quite some more.  \nIn other words the Greel Semele characters need a bit of a little more enhancing in their characteristics and also to have in some characters a novel morphology (like the ones that you did with nu and kappa for Guifa) in order to be universally accepted by typographic scholars and be included in international digital libraries.\n\nIn view of all the above my suggestions for enhancing the Greek characters of Semele are the following:\n\nSigma - Move the middle point 20-30 em to the right and downwards  \nPhi - Move the whole oval of Phi a little downwards  \nalpha - Better to use another Oldstylish form (Lambrakis or Optima)  \ngamma - Make it more balanced vertically  \ndelta - Better to use a more Oldstylish form (Apla or Porson or TimesTen)  \nepsilon - Excellent letterform  \nzeta - Keep the epsilon-esque curve-endings but it would be better to use a more Oldstylish form (Apla or Papyrus or Porson)  \neta - The eta needs something but I can’t figure it out yet, maybe an Oldstyle form as in Apla or Katsoulides  \ntheta - Make the top and bottom more pointed  \niota - make this ‘iota hook’ parts in ALL lower case letters much more emphasized as in Apla, TimesTen, TimesNewRoman or Porson  \nkappa - You can also use one of the exquisite ‘kappa’s that you posted to Guifa - kappa.3  \nlambda - Excellent kappa and lambda  \nnu - You can use instead one of the beautiful ‘nu’s that you posted to Guifa - nu.3 or nu.5  \nxi- Keep the epsilon-esque curve-endings but it would be better to use a more Oldstylish form (Apla or Papyrus or Porson)  \nrho - The end of the ‘tail’ of rho should be moved 20-30 em to the right  \npi & tau – Excellent  \nphi - Better to use another Oldstylish form (TimesTen or Papyrus)  \nchi - Better to use another Oldstylish form (Apla or Katsoulides)  \npsi - Move middle left curve point 20-30 em upwards  \nomega – Excellent letterform\n\n"

For Qoppa, the uppercase has been designed as a reversed P (think like Я and R, but with P). For Sampi, it's like a Lambda but with a middle diagonal line going from the middle baseline up into the right arm (sort of like //\\ ). That said I prefer the capitals that look a bit more like the lowercas, but I'll probably add the others as an alternate glyph :P\n\nAlso for the Ypogegrammoni, I would go with the third or (preferably) forth option in the Semeli(Thetis)LightRomanItalic\\_Version\\_15Na.indd\\_\\_0.pdf file.

      "content": "Coronis and Psili\n\nIn view of your question about how coronis and psili should be designed I did some research and here is what I found out. I am sure that you will find it quite interesting.\n\nAccording to Nick Nicholas a Greek language linguist from Australia coronis is:\n\nU+0343 Combining Greek Koronis [̓]; U+1FBD Greek Koronis [᾽]\n\nThe Coronis is a diacritic that looks like a smooth breathing, never looks like anything but a smooth breathing (except when it looks like a rough breathing), and can be regarded as a special variant of the smooth breathing. Unicode decomposes U+0343 canonically to U+0313 Combining Comma Above, the smooth breathing. This means that as far as it is concerned, the coronis and the smooth breathing are identical. As we will see, this is correct: while there is a semantic distinction between the two, it is entirely predictable, and Greek typography has never been concerned with distinguishing it anyway.\n\nThe coronis is the Byzantine device for notating a phonological process in Ancient Greek called crasis, whereby the vowel at the end of a word and the vowel at the beginning of the next word were merged together into a third, new vowel or diphthong:\n\nτὸ έναντίον = τοὐναντίον  \nτὸ αυτό = ταυτό  \nὁ ἐπί = οὑπί  \nκαί οὐ = κοὐ\n\nAnd that’s all the coronis is. A visual reminder of a breathing mark that is underlyingly there, as the beginning of a new word, but on the surface has been effaced through crasis. Since it is a visual reminder of a breathing mark, it behaves in the way a breathing mark behaves; as you can see in τοὔνομα, ἐγᾦδα and προὔχων, it interacts with other Greek diacritics in the way a breathing mark normally does. So it is typographically identical to a breathing mark, and always has been.\n\nΤhe coronis is a misplaced breathing mark, and its location is predictable: there is no need to have a distinct codepoint for it.\n\nIn papyrology, coronis—literally ‘hook’—refers to a dingbat used to mark the end of a chapter or poem. Much bigger than a breathing mark, and unrelated to it.\n\nThis undermines the notion that the coronis is a sign distinct from the breathing mark: its distribution is in predictable complementary distribution to that of the breathing mark, and its form as smooth or rough is not necessarily independent of the original mark on the second word.\n\nThe reason for Unicode not to grant the coronis an underlyingly distinct codepoint was a blanket agnosticism about diacritics. Diacritics have very different semantics from language to language, and rather than encode each variation in meaning, Unicode has elected to simply encode the shape: if two diacritics from whatever languages look identical, they are deemed to be identical. This runs roughshod over any semantic distinction between breathing marks and coronis; but as I believe I have shown, that distinction survives its elimination as a distinct codepoint anyway.\n\nSo. all in all the actual shape of ‘coronis’ is similar to that of the ‘psili’ and occasionally to the ‘dasia’ and placed above a lower case vowel.\n\nI have uploaded for you two pages about coronis and crasis from two Ancient Greek Grammars (Greek Grammar for Colleges by Herber Weir Smyth, 1918 and Greek Grammar by William W. Googwin, 1900) to make things even clearer.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Crasis_GREEK_GRAMMAR_FOR_COLLEGES72_4723.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022905im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Crasis_Coronis72_4533.jpg)\n\n"
