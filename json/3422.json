This program hasn't been updated in 6 years and isn't very stable. However, it is the only font printing program I've found that prints the characters per pica (at every point size from 6-18 I think). As book designers, this helps us estimate page counts for interiors. Is there any other newer, more stable program that can do this? We're unfortunately still using OS 9, but we have a few OS X computers if necessary. Thanks!\n\n",

Any other ideas? Thanks.\n\n"
