      "content": "Thanks Jens. I tried it and it doesn't work. I noticed on the uranges.dat file when opened in TextEdit shows just the start and end code points, each followed by a comma then the range name, like so:\n\n0x2460,0x24FF,Enclosed Alphanumerics  \n0x2460,0x2473, Circled numbers  \n0x2474,0x2487, Parenthesized numbers  \n0x2488,0x249B, Numbers period  \n0x249C,0x24B5, Parenthesized Latin letters  \n0x24B6,0x24E9, Circled Latin letters  \n0x24EA,0x24EA, Additional circled numbers\n\nYours, however show start,end,start no comma then range name.\n\nI tried:  \n0x1F500,0x1F5FF, Pictograms but that didn't work either.  \nIt's also difficult to know exactly where to put the data.\n\nThat would be a great idea Hrant - It would be so easy for FontLab to have a page available where one could just copy and paste the data from the internet into the uranges.dat file.\n\nNick\n\n"

Maybe that’s why you don’t see them in FL?\n\n> What about somebody making and publishing a uranges.dat\n\nAre you looking at me, Hrant? ;)\n\nIndeed I seem to have added new ranges to my uranges.dat a while ago, I think I made it manually, so I can’t guarantee it’s completely up to date.
