Still pretty convinced it's a techy freebie or a cutomization based on (various?) techy freebie. Try having a look to these 2 sections at DaFont, may be you'll be luckier than me: [Techno \\> Sci-fi](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831064626/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303), [Techno \\> Various](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831064626/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304) ( [TR-909](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831064626/http:/www.dafont.com/tr909.font), [Terminator](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831064626/http:/www.dafont.com/terminator.font), [Boom Box](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831064626/http:/www.dafont.com/boom-box.font)...)  \nPosting reworked sample too, could be helpful for some other identifiers...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831064626im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-2_5090.png)\n\nEDIT: finally, got it! That was [Boom Box](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831064626/http:/www.dafont.com/boom-box.font) but [full lowercase](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831064626/http:/www.dafont.com/boom-box.font?text=granite) and not uppercase...\n\n"
