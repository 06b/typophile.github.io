  "content": "Hi there,\n\nsometimes in vintage style show bills or packaging, you see these self-contained words, generally \"and\", \"with\", \"to\", etc.\n\nI have attached an example, which is circled within the poster.\n\nDoes anyone know of a modern font specialising in this type of thing? I found one once, but can't remember the name. Plus, I don't know what the correct term for these \"self-contained words\" is, which makes searching difficult.\n\nWould appreciate help.\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021004456im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Intern_Poster_4175.jpg)\n\n",
