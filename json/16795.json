In relation to one of them Maxim remarked: “I am not sure of that ‘Eastern letters horizontal / Western letters vertical’ bit, though.” This remark relates I guess to the thread here about cartesian space, as well as some of the diiscussion in the bouma as bounded map thread.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=)\n\n",
