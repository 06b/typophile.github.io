  "content": "Hi  \nI am designing the last cuts for a grotesk font.  \nIt is an Opentype (PS), with features such as ligatures, arrows, etc. and it is a latin extended set (for PL, SW, etc.).  \nThis 10 cuts font does work correctly when used directly inside Indesign (CS2) temporary fonts.  \nBUT  \nwhen i add it in a font manager such as FontExplorer or the Apple Font Book, it appears correctly in InDesign but makes my whole computer stop (the beautiful colored weel, you know) as soon as i use the hand tool to zoom or move inside a page.  \nWHY?  \nWHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG?  \nHELP!  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022034139im_/http:/www.optimo.ch/upload/font_type/SpecimenDada-bold.gif)\n\n",
