I get quite frustrated alot of the time by this kind of stuff. It's Hot Right Now, but it wont hold.   \n   \nIt's intimidating enough how much can be done with computers and printing without people doing something so \"whimsical\". Bloody fashion. So why is it that I go out with a fashion student? Hmm. Still, after all that the style is pretty cool. Very \"ephemeral\". This person must do something that's really cool, doing all those shows and projects.   \n   \n- Chris\n\n"
