      "content": "Hi Eluard!\n\nThanks that you appreciate it!  \nWe also used a particular method to handle beziérs to make the letters look more analog in feeling. To avoid also the contrast between staight and curved lines, to make junctions from straight lines to serifs more like they were in hotmetal. And in the end a more detailed design (f.e. serifs ecc.)\n\nciao  \nStefan\n\nPS. The Stamperia Valdonega has one of the highest standards in printing.  \nThey also did extraordinary 7-colours printing on the illustrations of this book.  \n(besides black ink is too grey in the scan, but I did that to get the letter forms clearer)\n\n"
