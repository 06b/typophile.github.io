They make the code, they pay the bills (rather high bills!), they make the rules. Yes, reality is that harsh.\n\n_\\>why not using fonts designed with absolute perfection hundreds of years ago, the kind of ones everyone would actually not discuss about?_\n\nUmmn, another Nota Bene… we cannot use fonts designed 100 years ago. Those were metal types. At best (for you), we could only use contemporary digital versions of those fonts. There is a big difference here!\n\nAnd lastly, I doubt that the Typophile administers and moderators would get so excited about old fonts. Many of us are type designers ourselves, or have worked in the type industry, and what we really care about is making and seeing new designs. Since fonts were made already \"with absolute perfection hundreds of years ago,\" according to you we should all pack up our bags and go home, right? Thankfully, as I said at the top of this post, that isn't a possibility, because even those old fonts won't show up on anyone's computer screens automatically! Or at least until someone invents a technology where you can pour old metal type sorts into the top of a computer, and then magically see letters dancing properly on the screen.\n\n"

Punchcut tries to support the typography community worldwide buy giving us all this venue to speak and even complain about all things typographic. Sometimes they try to recoup a small bit of the cost to support the site by getting foundries or designers to sponsor a very small ad or use a typeface for headings for a fee. They also sell T-shirts to help with the cost. There is no drama or guilt trip intended by Punchcut or anyone else. Typophile is a community of people with an interest in typography.
