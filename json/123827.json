  "content": "Hello, I'm looking for a sans-serif font with a lot of stylistic alternates similar to what [Whitney](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326165925/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/features/whitney-stylistic-sets) and [Concourse](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326165925/http:/mbtype.com/pdf/concourse-type-specimen.pdf) have. For example so you can swap out the default glyphs for single-story a, more humanist or more geometric t and M. I was thinking about going with Concourse because price/licensing are both good, but thought I'd look at alternative options. Any ideas? As those examples suggest I'm looking for a quite neutral design with a range of weights, suitable for body text or display. A condensed width and small caps would be nice.\n\n",

And the Neology has no italic.\n\nHowever, it is always possible to do a good faux by using the stroke command, coupled with a little extra tracking and perhaps a touch of horizontal scaling. And there may be some instances where the next weight up can be used as a small cap.\n\nHypatia  \nChalet\n\n"
