It couldn’t have happened to a better candidate, IMO. Miguel is one of the most knowledgeable and helpful contributers here at typophile, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who appreciates that. I figured since he’s now in [San Jose](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808124354/http:/typophile.com/wiki/San%252BJose), it’s safe to break the news. Let’s get a big round of applause, everyone!\n\n [‹ Kudos to Kris Sowersby](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808124354/http:/typophile.com/node/19684 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Zero in Garamond Premier Pro ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808124354/http:/typophile.com/node/19212 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
