They did many good and some excellent Greek interpretations of many Monotype, FontFont and Emigre fonts, and they are the leading Greek label, I think. Although I'm not so enthusiastic by Haramboulos' Gill Hellenic (I have a copy sent me by Panos and I have the Monotype version I bought as well), the design already existed. If there was someone to choose (in Greece) for the task, it could not have been none other than Cannibal, I suspect.   \n   \nIf you wish to see better and subtler work by Cannibal, you may look at the great Greek version of Fedra (developed by Panos Haratzopoulos with Peter Bilak) or to the classic but unusual Apollonia, by Panos' university teacher. Gill Hellenic is here, anyway (use the popup menu):   \n [http://www.fonts.gr/tryfonts/index.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108092736/http:/www.fonts.gr/tryfonts/index.asp)\n\n"

(Hector among other things, has been designing fonts for more than 20 years)   \nSome modifications that I did, do not remove any credit from Hector.   \nThis Greek version of Gill Sans is quite different than Gill Sans Dual Greek and is distributed under license of Agfa Monotype by Cannibal which is the name of our design studio.   \nThe reason why Athens 2004 used Gill Sans Hellenic is clearly quoted in Agfa Monotype's announcement.   \nNow, if Eric Gill was a paidophile and a pervert is something irrelevant with this conversation and I agree with what Dan posted.   \n   \nRED Design Consultants, together with Wolff Olins are the designers of the olive wreath mark as Nathan correctly noticed. The font used for the ATHINA logo is Foundry Sans (not Frutiger) with some slight modifications (ex. #2). Apart from the logo, nowhere else has any other font been used but Gill.   \n   \nAnd last, since it is Vincent's opening question, I am not aware of any assignment nor Gerry has ever mentioned, at least to me, something. Besides, Gill Sans Hellenic was decided as the Olympic font long before the year 2000 and at least anyone involved in our effort to organize the Games in Greece (publishers, printers, designers, advertisers or licensors) were well aware of that.   \n   \nPanos\n\n"

The people then involved had a preference for Foundry Sans, therefore it made it into the logo. My involvement was before and shortly after the time of the logo; in the end it came to little, mostly for licensing reasons. No mention of Gill Sans was made at the time I was in the loop, but I've been out of it for years.   \n   \nFoundry Sans had the double benefit of a contemporary design, and the lack of association with the British typographical tradition; arguably desirable attributes in this case. Its drawback, in the context, was the slanted italic.   \n   \nBeing in Greece for the four weeks preceding the Games and taking in as much as I could, I can say that the whole identity thing clicks together pretty well. However, the [pictograms](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108092736/http:/www.athens2004.com/athens2004/page/nochildren?lang=en&cid=c0a87ae4be659f00VgnVCMServer28130b0aRCRD#) deserved to be a bit more visible; or perhaps it is my current televisual perspective.\n\n"
