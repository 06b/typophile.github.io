There are numerous versions knocking around which are advertised as freeware but are basically re-distributed without the permission of those foundries and developers that produced the digital files. My concern is that you have modified another font to add your characters to and it is not clear how the original file was licensed or what its origin is. This is problematic in a number of ways but it also means that advertising your version of the font as usable for commercial work is misleading, as without knowing the full heritage of the file and licensing, supported by a recognised or robust EULA, it would be difficult if not impossible for a commercial entity to take advantage of the font.\n\nYou could avoid these issues by placing your original character set inside a new font file and applying clean metadata with a clear license and/or usage guidelines. Considering that you would like your data to be available for commercial usage but with a clause prohibiting modification, you might consider the [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported (CC BY-ND 3.0) license](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317093819/http:/creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/). While this license is not mindful of fonts specifically (though it is used in association with the [fontstruct font creation tool](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317093819/http:/fontstruct.com/faq/licensing_legal_questions/an_overview_of_licensing)), it is well established and covers your criteria.\n\n"

It would not be the first time that I have seen such a font with no Latin support, and with the design and data being yours from a legal and ethical perspective (though that is open to debate as well) you could place whatever restrictions or lack thereof on the font.\n\n"
