      "content": "The \\_a\\_ is very distinctive and an edited version of Priori Serif is perhaps the source of your image. The other letters resemble Times Roman. Possibly TR was edited to include an \\_a\\_ in the style of Priori Serif.  \nHave you checked the other fonts by the designers of Priori Serif, Jonathan Barnbrook and Marcus Leis Allion to see if they have produced another retail font with the \\_a\\_.  \nAt least some of their fonts are listed at at Identifont [http://www.identifont.com/show?1HU](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317085907/http:/www.identifont.com/show?1HU \"http://www.identifont.com/show?1HU\") and [http://www.identifont.com/show?30W](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317085907/http:/www.identifont.com/show?30W \"http://www.identifont.com/show?30W\")  \nI note that Jonathan Barnbrook does corporate identities. This might be worth checking as a possible source of the lettering in your image.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "The 'a' only resembles the one from Priori Serif, and the other letters are quite different. The E is not like Times NR, nor is the 'i'. Are there any other places where this font is used, so we could see more letters? I agree with Don that there could be some customizing happening, maybe just for a logo.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

There were 439 serif families with E's with no serif on the middle arm of the E, but not one that I found matching this sample. That either means it is custom, or a font I have missed in my collecting. (Or possibly, I overlooked it in my review, but I think I was thorough.)\n\nI know that may not be a definitive answer, but it is a data point.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
