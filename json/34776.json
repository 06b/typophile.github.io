  "content": "Hi Guys,\n\nI have a question about Fontlab and Opentype-features:  \nI want to make a OpenType-script for [swash](http://web.archive.org/web/20150222133132/http:/typophile.com/wiki/swash) characters. One script for  \nbeginning characters, and one for the last.  \nBut whatever I do, not only the beginning character are changed, but also  \nother Uppercase-letters inside the text-string....  \nWhat's going wrong??\n\nBest regards and thanks for your help,  \nMorten\n\n",

You might consider adding simple-substitution \"init\" and \"fina\" features into your font. The \"init\" would substitute regular letters with their initial forms, and \"fina\" would do the same for the final forms. These features are supported now (on user's discretion) in InDesign CS3.\n\nA.\n\n"
