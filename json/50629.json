The whole typeface has a nice dark complexion to it so you can read the characters well even at small sizes, nice and crisp, whereas so many other typefaces start looking brittle and weak around this point range. (I was surprised to see how sad the mighty Adobe Garamond Pro looks at 6pt.)\n\nDolly also looks great in a lot of other settings so it's worth licensing it as a workhorse in your personal collection.\n\nAll the best,  \nRahim\n\n"
