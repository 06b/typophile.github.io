  "content": "Hi,\n\nI have got a copy of the Indie Fonts book but when I try to install some of the fonts in the CD, some of them doesn’t have any extension at all. Though the book listed them as Opentype or truetype... when I try to install them by draging into the system’s font folder, it gives an error that they are either not regular font file or damaged...\n\nHow do I install those fonts in the CD that have no extensions?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n [‹ An alternative font for Trajan Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628192856/http:/typophile.com/node/46809 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Dangerous Curves by Doyald Young ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628192856/http:/typophile.com/node/46862 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
