(Preferably free...)   \n   \nThanks in advance. :D\n\n",

I know it's a vague description, but it is all I've got.   \n   \nThe thing is I'm not sure how a typical Noir-font would look. I've done some research, but I wasn't able to determine what could be considered as Noir'ish since what I found was so diverse.   \n   \nSo any help would be greatly appreciated. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623020929im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
