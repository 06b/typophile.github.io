  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nSorry I don’t have an image yet of the typestyle I’m looking for, but I’ll try to describe it as best I can.\n\nIt’s a caps only, tall, narrow, somewhat ornate sans serif font with nicks and notches in it like Papyrus. It vaguely resembles Galahad, but more condensed.\n\nThis font is used for the hardcover dustjackets of the tenth anniversary re-release of the “His Dark Materials” books (i.e., “The Golden Compass,” etc.), paired with P22’s Cezanne.\n\nI remember this font was also used for some of Panera Bread’s marketing a couple of years ago.\n\nI’ll try to get an image of this as soon as I can, but if anyone knows this font in the meantime, I’d be ever so grateful!\n\nCheers,  \nJohn the Fontaholic\n\n [‹ Zac Kyes squiffy grotesque font](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201223129/http:/typophile.com/node/39613 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [VH1 Best Week Ever Font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201223129/http:/typophile.com/node/39619 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
