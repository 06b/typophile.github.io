My business name is monolinea, which means \"one line\".   \n   \nI found a great font Alusine by Jack Usine, which fits the concept perfectly and am working at customizing it a bit. Here's what I've got so far, basically making changes to the \"i\" in the first line, and the \"r\" and \"V\" in the second, but I'm not sure it's working to well. Any critiques, suggestions or comments would be welcome.   \n   \n ![monolinea](http://web.archive.org/web/20060525065618im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/69252.gif)\n\n",

One font is not a mono-font.   \n Monospaced font are not called onespaced font.   \n   \n'Egg' in Finnish is 'muna' but if you start counting them   \nit is 'munaa' the word.

      "content": "Hi Kemie,   \n   \nTwo thoughts:   \n1. The e/a combination is awkward. Considere drawing a single storey a and connecting the e to it like the m/o combination. I think it will match the feel of the other letters better. You might also consider a small cap E form. The overbite might be less awkward.   \n2. The off-center diseno interactivo seems odd because of the symmetry of the end swashes (which I like alot!) I'd get rid of these words all together if it was me.   \n3. What other monolinea ideas have you explored? How about a connecting script or brush script. How about connections more like Process Lingua? Or a rounded version of lingua if that suits your style better. What about a sharpie drawn Bickham? Monoline has so many possibilites!   \n   \nAlso, be sure to do a pixel-perfect (hand hinted) version at the small size you will use it online. In other words, make the thins exactly 1 pixel, the white space 1 pixel, and the stems 7 pixels (or whatever makes sense). This could look very cool methinks.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"
