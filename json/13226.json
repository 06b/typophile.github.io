Now I see the same candy for 75 cents!\"\n\nThere are lots of reasons to need to print the florin symbol. It has just has fallen out of contemporary use…\n\nIn Germany, when someone wants to imply how expensive something is, they say houw much it would have cost in Deutsche Marks (2 DM = 1 Euro), i.e., \"You can afford that car!

You might need a different browser.\n\nBut the question of how best to space the florin hasn't been adressed here or in the other thread. I guess you could just use your own judgement, but it being historical & all it would be ideal to know what the convention might be.\n\nHoefler?

      "content": "Well, if your font has [an option for] monowidth numerals, the Florin should have that width too, which sort of nicely constrains you. Then it's a matter of taking into account which side of a numeral it might abut against, with the other side being almost certainly a blank. But a quick search on Google\\* for \"ƒ50\", \"ƒ 50\", \"50ƒ\" and \"50 ƒ\" seems to show that although the prefix position is more common -and as far as I know the standard- the suffix position cannot be ignored, because we're here to make settings look good and work well, not to try to dictate usage of language; this is by looking at the number of hits for each.\\*\\* So I'd say you have to mind both sides (but really with numerals only). Think kerning.\n\n\\* Which also reveals some interesting indepedent uses of the Florin!\n\n\\*\\* I actually use Google for spellchecking.\n\nMy middle initial stands for Hratch, my father. And my son's name is Hrad.  \nThe root \"hoor\" means \"fire\" in Armenian. But they're nothing like me.\n\nhhp\n\n"
