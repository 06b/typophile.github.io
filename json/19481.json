Goudy**\n\nThe preeminent American type designer who had created over 100 classic faces was the Art Director of [Lanston Monotype Company](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202185909/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lanston%20Type%20Co.) from 1920-1947. Thirty of his designs were created specifically for Lanston and all will be available in the near future as a fitting tribute to Goudy’s typographic legacy.\n\n**Articles**  \n [Wikipedia Article on Frederic Goudy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202185909/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Goudy)  \n [Goudy's Aries](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202185909/http:/p22.com/terminal/aries.html)\n\n**Video**  \n [Goudy in his studio](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202185909/http:/www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/movies/movs/index.php?ID=Goudy_S3&TYPE=mov&W=320&H=240) (from [Typeculture.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202185909/http:/www.typeculture.com/))  \n [Goudy Home Movie](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202185909/http:/tdc.org/membership/2002goudytapes.html)\n\n**Typefaces by Frederic W.
