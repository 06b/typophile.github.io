  "content": "I haven’t been able to get any support out of Apple or Microsoft so I thought I’d try here. I just upgraded to Tiger (21 PowerMac G5s with 10.4.1) and now Word and other Office applications are reporting that I have a bad font during the “Optimizing Font Menu Performance” routine. The message actually comes from the operating system but is triggered by Office applications. The system disables the font. If I reinstall the font it works fine in all other applications until I run an Office application. This is a font I’ve used for 10 years (its a custom in-house font) from OS 7.1 through 10.3.9 with all Office applications. The font verifies correctly in Font Book and Font Doctor. I’ve deleted the Office preferences and cleared font caches. It’s happening on all computers running Tiger. Any help or suggestions are appreciated.\n\n",
