The package consists of font files (regular, bold, italic) which form the components of the stars and stripes over the regular font. This is a how to for using the fonts.

But I wonder if a simpler set of instructions might be useful for people who might get distracted by the stars and stripes and miss the explanation. There are a lot of designers who can barely cope with their software to begin with, try to take it easy on them.\n\nAlso, do you really need to keep the named of the layer fonts as Italic, Normal-Italic, etc? Or could you name them after their functions?\n\n"
