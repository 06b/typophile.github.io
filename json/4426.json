I thought 1 looked sort of like a snowboard, but 515 isn't an even denomination for number of rotations like 360 or 720.\n\n"

I think BJ is right in that the right unique typeface would give these logos more individuality.   \n   \nI'm trying to keep it simple and I don't have a lot of revision time. Is there any one design that that stands out above the others? Any problems or adjustments that could improve any specific designs?   \n   \nThanks for all the feedback.\n\n"

      "content": "Stephen   \n   \nRE: \"I don't have a lot of revision time.\"   \n   \nConsidering that you are only at the \"�just brainstorming ideas\" phase of your own identity I would suggest making more time for revision. This may be one of the few times that your client (you) can allow for revision after revision. Don't rush this one, otherwise, I can guarantee that as a designer, you will want to redesign it within a few months (or even weeks). If you do it well the first time, then it should last years.   \n   \nRE: Logo   \n   \nBJ is right on. These faces, especially the \"1\", don't do the name justice. Either spend some time (and maybe $) finding some better numeral forms or create them.   \n   \nI'm still confused about the name. Is it 515 Main St? If so, I think this lends to some great photographic imagery, like on the original Typophile homepage (fourth screen in slide show) [http://www.punchcut.com/case\\_studies/typophile.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121755/http:/www.punchcut.com/case_studies/typophile.shtml)   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

      "content": "I like the idea of the 515 partially cutout from a background like 1 and 4. Instead of settling on one concrete design, I'd focus more on choosing/creating a distinctive typeface for the text and numerals and using that as the common thread in all designs. That way, you can continually alter the background shape/image/what-have-you, without changing the distinctiveness of the logo.   \n   \nFor example, if you took the \"studio 515\" from #4 and made the field in the shape of a red fireman's helmet, it would still be recognizable as your logo. Many companies do this when branding product, some even go so far as to change all parts of the design but the name itself.   \n   \nAs for typeface recommendations, I'm a sucker for serif small caps. A nice Neoclassical or Lyrical Modernist face, with condensed italic numerals and standard-weight small caps for the text would look smashing,\n\n"
