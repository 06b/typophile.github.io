I've included a screenshot (please disregard the crap editing, I was trying to remove a flash that washed out a few of the letters) This seems like a really great community. Thank you for taking the time to read this and any for your help in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015104311im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_6414.JPG)\n\n",
