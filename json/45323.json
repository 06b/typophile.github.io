Another option would be to shorten the inner part of both “T” if you want the letters to be separated. Tighten about 25-30%. Secondly I would also tighten up the kerning on the pay-off about 20-30% and som extra on the space between “brand” and value. It might just be the picture, but to me the vertical stroke seems too thin to my eyes. Good luck.\n\n"
