Considering how tight you’re letter spacing is, you might want to kern the “IN” & “RG” tighter and loosen the “A2” on INTERGISA2000 and the tighten up the “Co” and “Se” on the rest.\n\nHowever, The transparency of the blocks seem lazy and distracting. Is there a reason why you did this? You are aware that there is now green elements (be it 2 very small corners) in your logo.\n\n"
