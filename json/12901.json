  "content": "The typecon website states  \n\"optional workshops: $100 for each full-day session and $50 for each half-day session, plus materials fees if any\"\n\nMaybe I am blind but I cannot seem to find information about them on the typecon site. Does anyone have a link to these workshops? I even signed up for the newsletter and not received any information about them. (is it just too early for a schedule?)\n\n",
