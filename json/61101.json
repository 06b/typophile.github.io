But if you are allowing the browser to render the ttf or otf file, then some of the license rules will be broken.\n\n"

If the foundry you're licensing from doesn't offer server licenses then a workstation license may be sufficient, but you may get caught out under restrictions around concurrent users - especially if they define web site visitors (people who indirectly use the font) as users. As always the best option is to ask the foundry.\n\n"

The problem is that they don't know what to charge and with what terms, and until recently it didn't seem like they were missing a huge market.

      "content": "My take. Server side rendering of text to bitmap is at least as old as the (graphical) Web. Remember in the early days of Mosaic and Netscape there were no font tags or CSS, so the only way to do non-Times/Courier text was to pre-render or render-on-the-fly text server-side. The font foundries largely ignored this for say the first six or eight years, until server-side rendering (and for that matter server-side PDF generation) started to threaten their core-businesses (selling fonts to application developers and graphic designers) through things like business card design services, holiday card customization, and more recently web-based design apps. At that point they started to take notice. I think you see the same kind of pattern with Flash and some of the other technologies.\n\nThere are interesting parallels with raw-font linking. When Safari launched with support for raw fonts I talked to Apple folks about it down in Cupertino (this was during a public meeting around OpenType/ ISO OFF standards items). The engineer I spoke to said that raw-font-linking would open the door to brand new business models for type designers. I was kind of skeptical – said that font foundries really didn’t want to change, and certainly didn’t like outsiders telling them they had to. I think it’s interesting that with TypeKit et al, people from outside of the traditional font community were have been able to find a business model.\n\n"

If an ISV wants to bundle a font with a business card application, that's also a sale, and much more money based on the level of redistribution. But if someone were to host that business card application online, using server-side rendering, should that also be covered by a $25 end-user license?\n\n"
