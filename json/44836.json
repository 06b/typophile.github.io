I'm trying to purchase a typface from the man himself but am having great troubles along the way, debit card denied and the site contact form not working either, to mention a few.\n\nFirstly - Hubert if you pick this thread up, could we perhaps talk to resolve this as i need the typeface as a matter or urgency?\n\nSecondly - if any one is in regular contact with him could you mention this, or if any one knows of any alternative contact details?\n\nAll help is greatly appriciated\n\nLuey  \n [francis.design@gmail.com](mailto:francis.design@gmail.com)\n\n",

Sometime it is only the expiring date.  \nYesterday I had problems, because for some strange reason my providers server was on a spam blacklist in the USA.  \nSo some emails could not be delivered. I hope this helps.  \nHubert\n\n"
