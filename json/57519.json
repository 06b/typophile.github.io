Would it be more appropriate to use an image that is closer to the thrust of the event? I think you could simply use the image on the bottom.\n\nI don’t know if this is a personal preference but I think the multiple alignments is jarring and I get stuck in the all over cluster in the middle.\n\nThe type looks amateurish to me (a cousin to comic sans?).\n\n“realy” is spelled “really”\n\nThe y of Everyone is falling into the t of Invited.\n\nAre the prospective attendants of this event subject to censorship? While I think forums like these are a staple of democracy, I think it is a mistake to invoke quasi-revolutionary rhetoric in a country where freedom of speech rules the day (for the most part).\n\nHope others will disagree with me.\n\n"
