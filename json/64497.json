If you think of the crudeness of the technology, you realize that this was not about matching the purity of a typeface but making a cheap and fast product that would survive the production process with few “throw aways” and function as something that could be nailed on a door—like a tapered horseshoe nail.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Everything was done by hand and reproduced with crude molds.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
