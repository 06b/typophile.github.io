If somebody who knew no better were to   \nread this thread as it stands, they'd leave thinking that URW is a   \nscumbag font pirate company. I'm _really_ not trying to be contentious   \nhere, but I'd like to clarify some things.   \n   \nYves, you lumped URW into the same paragraph (next sentence,   \nin fact) with \"those quick-steal-jobbies\" and then \"all they did was   \nchange the most distinctive characters into something else, slant   \nthe roman instead of providing true italics, digitally extrapolate some   \nextra weights, maybe add an outline or rounded version, and bingo:   \n1000 fonts for $24.95 whattadeal!\". This effectively equates them   \nwith Southern Software or Bay Animation or any of those other crooks   \nwho renamed fonts and sold CD's full of them at a pittance.   \n   \nNow surely you weren't speaking of URW here. If so, I'd honestly   \nlike to learn what it's based upon. Specifically, [URW Agenda](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210203807/http:/www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/english/schnellsuche.htd?searchchar=agenda) has no   \nitalic, much less a false one or outline or rounded variants. I'm not   \naware of them doing this with other typefaces either.   \n   \nSecondly, Clearface Gothic is attributed to Morris Fuller Benton. URW   \nalso offers [Clearface Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210203807/http:/www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/english/schnellsuche.htd?searchchar=clearface) and gives proper attribution to Benton,   \n1906. So why offer Agenda as well, if it's meant as a thinly veiled clone?   \nAgenda is attributed to [Phil Martin](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210203807/http:/www.urw.de/english/schrift/wahl7-set.htm), who, prior reading has led me to   \n believe, was no slouch when it came to designing at least a few well   \nknown and well used fonts in an earlier era. [See here especially](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210203807/http:/mm2000s.net/index2.shtml). First   \nhit the Font History button and be ready to hold your cursor over the   \nStop button in this awkward presentation (at least Agenda is the 2nd   \nfont shown). Mr. Martin makes a statement much like Mike's about the   \nletter 'g'. Now hit the Font Graphic button and behold the very 'g' thought   \nto be \"homemade\".   \n   \nSo, Martin takes a 1906 typeface and, in 1976, makes several significant   \nmodifications to it. Absolutely he ought to have credited Benton. Two years   \nlater, Victor Caruso takes that same old typeface and digitizes it.   \n   \nMy beef here is that, while I detest the folks like Southern Software who   \nsteal, rename and sell, there are so many gray areas to this topic. What   \noccurred with Agenda has occurred to varying degrees with many, many   \nfont foundries, some of them large and well respected. An existing typeface   \nwas modified, sometimes precious little and called something new. Even   \nworse, in my opinion, has been perpetrated: [1](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210203807/http:/www.ms-studio.com/articles.html) & [2](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210203807/http:/www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsia.html) (Thanks for these articles,   \nMark. I'm sorry if you didn't intend them to be used this way).   \n   \nMy intent is definitely not to paint Monotype black, but to show lurkers who   \ndon't know better that ethical gray appears in lots of type foundries and to   \ncall, say, ITC and Monotype the good guys and, say, URW and Bitstream   \nthe bad doesn't do justice to any of them. I've seen, recently, Bitstream,   \nCorel and, now, URW labelled flatly as fiends, as if it's a known fact\n\n"

      "content": "Mike,   \nThanks for uncovering that story. Mr Martin seems like a bit of an eccentric, but aren't we all?   \n   \nMy understanding of many of the URW fonts was that when they had one of the few (along with Bitstream) places where foundries could get typefaces digitized (with their tool Ikarus), they made a deal that they could sell every font they digitized as long as they changes the name (hence all the Latin-sounding names for familiar-looking fonts).   \n   \nSo Bitstream and URW truly do not belong in the bucket with other 'cloners'. I don't know what the Corel story is, although you say they made a deal to allow them to sell all these fonts re-named? Can you point to anywhere that this is documented just so I can clear up my own impression of them?   \n   \nAs for the other foundries imitating the fonts of others, this is a practice that goes back to early type history. I would love it if a type historian could unravel some of the 'genealogy' of many of these fonts. Linotype's \"Memphis\" is an example of a metal type they created in the 30's to compete with Monotype's \"Rockwell\", so that they could offer the same kind of typefaces to their customers (I think I named the right fonts with their foundries, but apologies if I got it mixed up). The point being, just as in Marks tale of the Arial's of Monotype, that foundries are just as determined to keep abreast of their competition as any other business is. Still, these are newly designed, if not original, and not literally copied from each other's masters, and I think our intent in slamming certain suppliers (I can't call them foundries) is that they have no skill to design anything. They just copy the work of others and market it at prices that devalue all the other fonts, and give an excuse to folks who think if font companies can be corrupt, why is it wrong to steal fonts. Aaarghhh!   \n   \nThis has been an interesting thread, and again, Mike I think you were right to make your points and it was great work to find out the story of that 'g'. Now I wonder how it survived to be in the sample that William posted?\n\n"
