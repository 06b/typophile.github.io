I was really astonished to learn there that the turmoil of the past 50 years in type—hot metal to film to digital and then added screen—has been going on since the early 19th century. Huge changes have happened regularly, with machinery and even professions being outmoded regularly. The Museum of Printing also houses the over 300,000 drawings from Linotype in the hot metal and pantographic punch cut days, which are fascinating.\n\n"
