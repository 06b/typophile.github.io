The brief is small and simply: the identity have to be strong, clear and not cheap, Bulgary under dentists :) So I created something where the phylosophy hide in the letters... the sign consists both with “p” and “m” and build together the form of tooth.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [meurerpalazis.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090507185532/http:/typophile.com/files/meurerpalazis.gif) | 23.92 KB |\n\n",

I would try and beef it up a bit, which might require shrinking it’s overall size to accommodate for it’s new heftiness.\n\nUnless, you’d rather use a lighter weight for the text... this would make the logo “pm” pop more, creating a different contrast.\n\n-Andrew\n\n"
