  "content": "Hello, could anybody tell me what this font is, or any similar ones?  \nI’m trying to find exact fonts for both main type, Jade Palace and sub type, Golf Club.  \nThe main type seems to be EF Ballantines Script Light, but I don’t see it exactly overlaping. And as far as the sub type goes, I have no idea what exactly the font is used. Can anyone please identify them?  \nYour help would be highly appreciated.

Goddess) although maybe a heavier weight than light. “Golf Club” looks like an Italic of one of the Bodonis. I’ll try to see if I can narrow it down.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
