There is not really a concept I thought about, but I seen how funny it would look to mix these images. I mean an ape with a astronaut suit on holding an american flag is somewhat awkward to see. Even Barack Obama with an afro is something you would not see everyday. I just thought that this is an interesting visual because it is not organized and it is a mix of unlike images. \n",
