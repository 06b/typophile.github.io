  "content": "Hi all,\n\nIm after some feed back on my little display face. Its based on a circular modular grid. Its pretty simple but the idea is I will laser cut some characters and then letterpress them at about 12\"/25cm, and have a play with the letter forms and not the entire font.\n\nThanks for the time and help.\n\nTheo.\n\nps, Ill be letterpressing these on Friday so if people are interested Ill stick some images up. ; )\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160103im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1grids_small_circles-01_5235.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Nice work. I like the organic shape these letters take on. I'm not certain the title 'Geometric Typeface' necessarily fits this work though. I understand why you've chosen that name but this work doesn't share any similarities with Futura or other similar fonts that are truly geometric fonts.\n\nThe 'lowercase b, d and h' have very short ascenders that end abruptly, consider adding some height to those ascenders. The 'lowercase k' is my least favorite glyph, while the 'lowercase t' is one of my favorites.\n\nKeep at it, looking really nice.\n\n"
