Stephen is ribbing me because Legato is not my favorite [Evert Bloemsma](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213735/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Evert%252BBloemsma) font... but this is very beautiful. In fact if someone forced me to use [Gill Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213735/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gill%252BSans) (\\*that overused and aging uberclassic) again I’d have to convince them to use Legato instead.\n\n\\* Yeah, Gill Sans is overused but it’s italics are still in my top 5, maybe top 3, best examples of sans italics. =) Sorry, I didn’t mean to stray the conversation from that nice embossed sample here...\n\n"

In my view if the glyphs are pretty there’s something wrong.\n\nBeing a text face (as much as a sans could be), unless one accepts what Legato is trying to do, the only way somebody can mean something like “I don’t think the reversed contrast stuff works” is to actually read text set in Legato. Otherwise it’s probably the typical conservative reactionarism. The old “It’s different than what I’ve already decided I like, so it must be bad.”\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "I recently checked out the Manders book from UCLA. Yes, I could be imagining the following because I admittedly want it to be true, but Legato does seem to transcend the black and make a setting part of a whole with the paper (and not just on the cover where it’s debossed). Looking at the various large-size settings throughout the book it’s notable that I seem to feel a gentle resistance to my picking out of individual letters to analyze... This is good news for notan.\n\nSadly the only smaller-size settings in the book are in Balance for some reason, so any first-hand evaluation of Legato’s real-world readability (as nearly hopeless as that would be, especially for somebody like me who’s so concerned with it) will have to wait.\n\nhhp\n\n"
