  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am assigned with the job of designing a few certificates for participation, excellence in individual fields and a few other general categories.\n\nPlease help me with choosing the right fonts for the job under 3 categories. I already have a few on my mind mentioned below. Please don’t hesitate to comment on them too\n\n1.Serif : I have Scala, Nexus & Berkeley  \n2.Sans: Univers, Flama, The Sans  \n3.Cursive/Script : Bickham Script Pro, Palace Script, Flemish Script\n\nIf it’s not too much can someone suggest what colors will look good for certificates. These certificates are for a Medical University.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance\n\nLordKV\n\n",

      "content": "I think the problem with most certificates is they do rely on what has been done. The intent of a certificate is to give the recipient tangible proof of there achievement. With that it needs to “feel” and “look” worthy of this.\n\nFor the cursive script I might recommend [Zaner Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20060719212918/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/zanerproset.html). The upside of this is two-fold. It is based upon the writing style of a lettering teacher who might have done something which needs decoration. The second being it was digitized by our own Paul Hunt. Take a peek at it. I’d say the way the name appears will set the tone for the rest of it.\n\nIs the border set, or are you designing that as well?\n\n"

I am sorry I know I am not making much sense typing. I will upload a preview once I am done. Zaner looks cool though. Might check it out.\n\n"

If not, have you considered using it?\n\nOne point … Can you get the name of the Dean in sans, as well as the signature? Most university officials signatures cannot be read by humans :) and in the future the grad might want to know the name that is scribbled on the form.\n\nAlso, be aware that the college might want more than one signature. When I was involved with the University of Toronto, there were up to four signatures on the degrees.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for the suggestions. The font used on the logo is Palatino. Yes the name of the Dean will be mentioned in Sans. This is just a rough outline. What do you think of it so far? As far as the no of persons signing it, there would be only one and hence the space for one.\n\nI have one more crazy idea. IS it okay to put a frame around it. I mean in photoshop using some nice wood texture. Sorry if it is too silly.\n\nAlso what about if I just play around with the hues and make similar certificates (changing the borders of course) for other purposes like participation in a camp, best student and faculty etc.\n\nAnd finally does it look okay from a University point of view\n\nTIA\n\nLordKV\n\n"
