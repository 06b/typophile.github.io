In TextEdit there is hardly any line spacing. Quark crashes...\n\nI've uploaded the resulting TrueType font and would be grateful if someone could have a look at this, maybe with FontForge and tell me what on earth I have to do differently.\n\n[http://nullsieben.co.uk/ArtFund-Symbol-A1.ttf](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210214/http:/nullsieben.co.uk/ArtFund-Symbol-A1.ttf \"http://nullsieben.co.uk/ArtFund-Symbol-A1.ttf\")\n\nMaaaaaaaany thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "The glyph that occupies the \"s\" needs to have the contours merged. The contours are currently overlapping. Spacing alone should be able to handle the shapes of your symbols, so I'm not sure why there are kerning features and other kerning pairs added. Between the coffee cup and the wheelchair, there is a positive kern of 3075. It seems if you need a specific space between those two characters, you could put them together as a single glyph.\n\n"

      "content": "Your problems may also come from the options when you generate the font (but I would remove all kerning pairs anyway). For instance I just downloaded the [public domain]\\* icon font [marvosym.ttf](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210214/http:/www.marvosym.de/download.html) (Für Puristen) and installed it on my mac. TextEdit would'nt even see the font. So I uninstaled it, opened marvosym.ttf with fontforge, clicked \"File \\> Generate fonts\", then clicked \"Options\" and unchecked \"Apple\", \"Opentype\" and \"Old style kern\" and then generated a new ttf font that I installed; everything seems to work nicely (always better to check the file with \"Font Book\" before installing, of course).\n\n[edit] \\* I meant Freeware; here is the copyright: _Martin Vogel's Symbols are freeware - look for information and new versions at [http://www.marvosym.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210214/http:/www.marvosym.com/ \"http://www.marvosym.com\") - Neue Versionen und Informationen finden Sie auf [http://www.marvosym.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210214/http:/www.marvosym.de/ \"http://www.marvosym.de\")_\n\n"

      "content": "I just don't get it --- I thought creating a font was easier....\n\nStill the same problems:  \n- the latest typed Character is not visible (a row of characters shows then, minus the last one)  \n- when doing a return the text below diappears  \n- Also, the typeface name in the Illustrator font menu is in brackets . I just cant work out why. Other symbol fonts don't have that.\n\nHere's a test file with more or less all the Fontforge defaults in place. I just imported the drawings and generated the font. I'll do letter spacing later. What would I have to do now to get it to work in the first place?  \n [http://nullsieben.co.uk/symbols2.sfd](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018210214/http:/nullsieben.co.uk/symbols2.sfd \"http://nullsieben.co.uk/symbols2.sfd\")\n\n"

The fact that the space character was undefined caused some problems and I just added it. The name of the font (independently of the filename) is, as you chose, \"Untitled2\" and when I select it in Word, Photoshop or Inkscape, I do not experience any of your problems. Maybe I should add that I am a LaTeX user and, for my very limited needs, fontforge has so far proven enough. This implies nothing for use in more sophisticated environments.\n\n"
