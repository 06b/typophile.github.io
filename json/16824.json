Right underneath the current bid amount, the button says **Bod plaatsen \\>** which means _Place bid_. Click it.\n\nOn the next page, in the right hand column, fill in your **Gebruikersnaam** _(User name)_ and **Wachtwoord** _(Password)_ and log in by clicking the button **Veilig inloggen \\>**.  \n(If you are not yet registered to eBay, I suggest you do that on the English-language website. That'll save you a lot of trouble.)\n\nOn the next page, you can place your bid where it says **Je maximumbod:** _(Your maximum bid)_ and then click the button **Doorgaan \\>** to continue.\n\nOn the next page you confirm your bid by clicking the button **Bod bevestigen**.\n\nGood luck -- you've got one day and 14 hours left.\n\n"
