  "content": "I'm planning to write a novel in the month of November (NaNoWriMo if any of you are familiar with it). I have a Jornada 680e, basically a cute little word processor. My main problem, however, is that it only has dumb quotes and dumb double quotes, I'd guess you'd say? The ' and \" aren't curled or anything.\n\nAs I transfer it onto my computer / work on the novel on my computer, there's obviously going to be a difference in these quotation marks. If anyone's familiar with this and knows settings to tweak / any programs, that'd be great! :-)\n\n-- David\n\n",
