  "content": "I been using modular scales in my layouts and typesetting recently and have built a calculator to help produce double stranded scales.\n\nI have also added in the calculations for ems and base 16 ems as I often need them when building websites.\n\nFigures can be entered as straight numerals or in picas and points, as in 10p6 for 10 picas and 6 points.\n\nAnyway I thought I'd share it here incase someone else may find it useful.\n\n[http://modular-scale.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317193222/http:/modular-scale.com/)\n\nI would also appreciate any feedback or suggestions.\n\n",
