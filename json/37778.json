It is stated here that this is one method of doing this and I was curious if anyone knows of any other methods to compensate the curve in Italic fonts.\n\nRr\n\n [‹ apple, pages and justification bug](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016080242/http:/typophile.com/node/37760 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [TypeTool and OpenType ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016080242/http:/typophile.com/node/36961 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
