  "content": "To the tune of an old, old Genesis song: “I can’t draw, I can’t paint. Only thing about me is the books that I make.”\n\nSo what I’m saying is, I’d never think to design a new typeface. And I wonder what might go thru the mind of someone getting up one morning and thinking, “Hey, I think I’ll get started creating a new typeface today.” In simple terms, I’m sure there’s some kind of a desire to create letterforms that are clear to the reader, easy for eyes to follow, and appear somehow new—having some unique aspect to their appearance. But I’m only guessing.\n\nI’ve been considering that and just why one turns to designing type, as opposed to anything else, for a few days straight now. It’s largely why I signed onto Typophile—and glad I am that I did.\n\nAnyhow, anyone care to oblige a newcomer with their take?\n\n [‹ Anyone know any good experimental, typographic layout designers?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32324 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Playing Card Font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36590 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

So at this point I’m not really concerned with what people think of it. Or markets or potential usage. Well I am of course, but I’m not selling it anyway. My interest in typefaces was mostly sparked with general interest in typography itself.  \nI don’t know, I just really enjoy grabbing a piece of paper or my moleskine and doodle away with letterforms that have popped up. At the moment I’m more working on lettering than complete typefaces. Very bad answer to your question. I think some of the more hardcore type designers might give you better insight. ;)\n\nOh, and welcome to Typophile. :)\n\n"

      "content": "I just started designing typefaces too, but here are some potental motivations that come to mind:\n\n- to revive an old typeface: you see something around you on street signs or in an old book and you think to yourself “wow, that is beautiful, I would like to have it in digital”. Revivalism is much more complicated than that, of course; sometimes you just want to explore more the tastes and letterforms of a certain period or a certain designer, and doing your own version of someone else’s typeface helps retracing the steps he went through and the decisions he had to make;\n- for a specific purpose: there are many situations that call for new typefaces. Think about advances in technology like fonts for computer or PDA screen, pixel fonts for mobile phones, etc. that call for new letterforms, or think about different versions of an existing typeface for new setting: maybe one of your clients uses a specific typeface for all its corporate image but they notice that when they use that font in posters or in very large settings it doesn’t quite work. Then you need to draw a new weight or optical size or whatever…;\n- to scratch a technical itch: what happens if I take Bodoni and remove the serifs? [Oh, I see](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.yoworks.com/moderno/index.html)…;\n- I know some type designers that often start with an æstetic research, trying new curves or shapes and see what they like…;\n\nOf course these are just a few ideas, but I hope you get the point. I felt as you do when I was getting interested in typography and then later in type design, I wondered where do these people got the inspiration to do what they did, but then studying the history of type design helped me see things a bit clearer.\n\nNow: from there to actually know how to create meaningful work, _that_ is something that is still a mystery to me too.\n\n"

      "content": "Okay, first my thanks to Ricardo—again—for pointing me to [the earlier thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/typophile.com/node/34373). There I found a link to [An Intro to Type Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=161). I’ve already read both and asked Unzipper when “the second and third episodes ... on the [type designer as] the craftsman and the technician respectively” will appear.\n\nAfter that I went to Amazon and located a boatload of books on designing type, typefaces, and fonts. Too many looked worthwhile to buy any yet, so I started by ordering half a boatload of them from my public library.\n\nI cannot quite put my finger on why the interest at all, and why just now. But I find myself considering trying my hand at designing a typeface family purely as a creative exercise. I suppose it could make me a better book designer/typesetter/page compositor/typographer, etc. (I am never 100% sure what to call myself.) That said there are difficulties, and I definitely feel the need to expand some on all I’m saying here on [my blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.tianodesign.com/blog).\n\nI repeat: I do not draw or paint. Never felt I could.\n\nStill, I’ve decided that the the best reasons, as I have gleaned from the earlier thread, why one bothers to try to design a typeface, are:\n\nas [new typefaces] are put out in the world and used they get associations attached to them. This of course can work for us in reinforcing the meaning that we are trying to communicate …\n\nI take this to mean that branding may take place. I’m reminded of a certain bakery brand that’s sold in NY—I think I’ve seen it in other parts of the country, too, but it originates here (on Long Island). I don’t know that the typeface that their name is written in was created for them originally, but it is definitely identifiable as theirs. I first learned this when I noticed an auto body shop that I pass regularly had a sign that looked so familiar to me and yet I couldn’t place why that it really bothered me. I stopped my car and stared for awhile. Driving away, I had an aha moment when I realized it was the same typeface as the bakery brand used.\n\nmaking the type better for the reader\n\nAs a book designer and layout artist that’s my number one objective: to bring the author’s work to readers clearly and in a way that is easy on their eyes. I want to encourage them to read the book completely and with maximum comprehesion.\n\n… arrogance and vanity. Possibly.\n\nAll the above goes to my simplified take, if you will, on why I might want to try my hand at designing a typeface family. My reasons are not necessarily good ones; they obviously are not the only reasons to take on such a project. That said, I move on to figuring just what this entails.\n\nMy list of physical tasks to do may not be complete. I may be unaware of any number of steps. And my steps could be out of a correct order. Please let me know what I m missing and where I ve gone wrong.\n\nFirst a question. I use the word draw below, for want of any other better term. It sounds to easy: Draw a letterform. Is that done in a piece of software such as Adobe Illustrator and then get brought into a piece of software such as Font Pro, either one character t a time or as a whole alphabet?\n\nOkay, two questions. When does one think about kerning tables? After all letterforms are drawn, I presume? And then letters are paired off in every combination to see how they look best, after which one uses software to build the kerning tables?\n\nPlease excuse the ignorance of these questions. As soon as I get my hands on the books I ve ordered, I can begin to do some research of my own. But I m too pumped with curiosity to just sit and wait for books to arise; hence I ask here. Maybe I will decide it s all too much work for someone who does not draw.\n\nThat said, here s my list ...\n\n1. Draw the upper-case alphabet, including text numbers and punctuation.  \n2. Draw the lower-case alphabet, including symbols asterisks, dagger, double daggers, etc.  \n3. Decide what ligatures to include typically, fl, ff, ffl, fi. As these are off the top of my head only, what others should there be?  \n4. Draw numbers for use in settings where they need to align on a decimal point i.e., tables, fractions, equations. I forget how this class of numbers is referred to.  \n5. Repeat above steps for italic, bold, bold italic, small caps, subscript, and superscript.\n\nGoes without saying my list is way simplified. But did I get the gist of it?\n\n"

      "content": "Steve: I say go for it. As cliché as it may sound, regardless of the result the journey alone is more than worth it for someone working in book design and dealing with type every day. It will make you question what it is exactly that you like in a typeface and better understand why certain things are drawn in a certain way. I’m not saying this from the ivory tower of a million accomplishments, I’m saying this from someone who used to be in your position just about eight months ago. If anything else, you will have a completely different viewpoint on typefaces and on the work that stands behind them (or lack thereof in some poor cases).\n\nAs for the process I don’t think there is “a better way”. I’m very bad at hand-drawing so every once in a while I doodle a bit on my notebook then if something catches my inerest I reproduce it on the computer. I don’t usually scan stuff and trace it because my drawings are quite poor at the moment so tracing them wouldn’t help in any way. I found I get better results if I draw the letterforms on-screen, although of course I’m also working on improving my drawing skills as they are essential to understand how letterforms are built. I also draw on paper when I am unsure about contrast in certain glyphs, sometimes.\n\nAs for the order of glyphs to design, I was watching a [lecture by Erik Spiekermann](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.esad.pt/personalviews/) yesterday where he stated that the basic “feel” of a text typeface is in the letters that are used most, which are a n e and s. After you’ve drawn the n, you can easily go from there to h m l i and u with a bit of tweaking, and that helps you get a feel for what your typeface will look like, what the x-height will be, how much contrast you’re going to put between the strokes, etc.\n\nI find that it’s easier for me to start with these base glyphs to build some momentum, start typing little words and checking out how they look, and then I can move on to draw all the rest of the lowercase, uppercase, numerals, diacritics… but that’s just the way I usually do things. Claudio Piccinini, a type designer friend of mine, once said to me he often starts from the numerals to get a feel for a typeface and then proceeds from there.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

      "content": "To start, I’m not a very experienced type designer myself, but here’s my two cents.\n\nA 1: I usually draw letterforms by hand, on a piece of paper. After that I scan and bring it to a piece of software, like Illustrator or directly into the font software, like FontLab Studio. And I then trace the scans to get the vectors. That is usally done one character at a time. But you can start off directly on the computer, however for me drawing it by hand is more natural and faster. You can try different approaches very easily. As Antonio already mentioned (and Erik Spiekermann obviously) starting with letters like a, n, e and s can be helpful, because those have the general shapes most letters are made of.\n\nA 2: Kerning is usually done at the later stages. Kerning is done in the font software itself, again like FontLab or something, and it usually builds the kerning tables as well.\n\nAnd it looks like your list is quite complete, although it does make it look easy. ;) It also looks like you want to design a very elaborate typeface, maybe try something simpeler first, like one weight with numerals and punctuation/diacritics? But then again, you could also just go for it!\n\n"

But if I do this—first off, it’ll be a long-term project, in between work—I’ll then draw in Illustrator.

But FontLab and other font-applications also use vectors. Béziers! ;)\n\nSpacing is created in font-software by means of the ’sidebearings’. Basically two lines, one on each side of a glyph. You can change the distance of these lines to the glyphs. The space _between_ these lines is considered part of the glyph, basically white space on both sides of a letter. So an ’a’ might have a _right_ sidebearing of 25 (space between the letter itself and the line), and an ’e’ might have a _left_ sidebearing of 44, making the spacing between these characters 69 units.  \nAfter this spacing, these spaces can be optically adjusted with kerning.\n\nHm, that might be pretty badly explained.

Get these two right,. Make the space on the left side of “D and p” visually equal to the same space in H and n respectively. Set the D’s right, (round) side so it looks balanced between two H’s. Transferr that round side bearing from “D” to both sides of the “O” (and “p” to “o”). Now balance V and v between H’s and O’s, (n’s and o’s) and you have three of the four major sidebearing types, (misc. being the other).

I must admit to being really excited by this.\n\nMy thanks to those of you who’ve answered in this latest flurry.\n\nI begin to see what a monumental task this whole biz of creating a complete typeface family is. The beauty of it is that I’m getting interested enough in it at the same time that I have no interest in working as a professional type designer. I like making books. So I have no pressing issues re: time—unlike with my book design and production work.\n\nThat raises another question that is apropos of nothing: How many of you typeface designers also work in page design—specifically in publishing, making book pages? How about advertising? How many of you are promarily page designers who also design type? Or does it pretty much turn out the other way around?\n\nQuincunx, it may be correct that Typophile is the place for beginning typeface designers. I certainly can’t imagine anywhere more helpful than you folks here. But it’s all so interesting to me at this stage that I want to read more online. That’s why I’ve ordered a bunch of books from the public library, so I can narrow it down to a handful of books to buy. And it’s most gratifying to see that the first or second book that caught my eye and that I ordered is the Karen Cheng book, Designing Type. I’ve also just downloaded the Jamra article.\n\nRicardo, believe me, throughout the last few days of asking questions and reading answers, I’ve been googling all manner of type design issues. I haven’t, however, gotten as far as the coupla sites you mentioned. I’ll be looking at them after I get done with some work on some booklets and their covers that I’m laing out for a publisher out west.\n\nJames, I’m just beginning to appreciate how broad the initial question I asked is, as well as just how many directions I’ve headed off in with my follow-ups. I agree that one of the difficulties almot certainly is the task of creating something unique and worthwhile. That is part of the appeal to me. But I must also admit that I’m likely to be something of a pleasure traveller, and not someone looking to create a whole roster of commercially available fonts.\n\nFInally, I’ve been looking into Fontlab. It’s an expensive proposition direct from the maker, $699. And yet when I search for it on sites like MacWorld’s comparison shopping area, or dealmac.com, or even a specific mail-order house like MacMall, I can’t find anything called FontLab.

Some of the better typefaces out there have been designed over the course of several years. You don’t need to spent several years per sé to create a good typeface, but it does take a lot of time.  \nBut of course it all depends how much time you want to spend on it, and how well you want to execute your design. The things I have done in type design usually took me 2 or 3 months.\n\n\\> _How many of you typeface designers also work in page design—specifically in publishing, making book pages?_\n\nTo answer your question; I am mostly working on graphic design, and also books/book pages. I’m experimenting with type design purely because it interests me. I’ve always been interested in typography itself, and from there I got interested in the letters and typefaces themselves.\n\nAnd I would just try some things, doodle a bit, draw a couple of alphabets. Worry about being very unique and worthwhile later. At least that is what I was/am doing. You need some sort of introduction to the whole design process first. When you somewhat mastered that, you can always try to design something really unique.\n\nAnd about FontLab, that is indeed quite expensive. I don’t know if anyone sells it below that retail price. There are alternatives though. The developer of FontLab Studio also releases [TypeTool](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/), which is basically FontLab’s little brother.

How about advertising? How many of you are promarily page designers who also design type?_\n\nI don’t think I can call myself a typeface designer — my training is in graphic design, but I’ve always had a thing for type. I have a few unfinished typefaces on my hard drive, which I work on when I can. (The only thing I’ve finished so far is not a design of my own, but a digitization of Ward Sutton’s hand lettering, which he used in his [Sutton Impact](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.villagevoice.com/news/0716,sutton,76368,9.html) strip. But I digress.) My work these days is design and production for direct mail and advertising agencies, multilingual DTP, and medical publishing. In another life I did layout for magazines and schoolbooks. I would like to get into book design at some point — interiors and/or covers.\n\n"

A technojunkie, I was newly married and they might have seemed like just very expensive toys otherwise. And now, 15 years later, I’m about half as busy as I’d like to be—which is to say, I’d prefer to always have two books going and two waiting in the wings. And not at $4 per page!\n\nAnd I digressed. I think what I need is to “go to school.” So as soon as I get the word that my boatload of books has started arriving, I’ll be diving in. And I guess what I need to do is add FontLab Studio 5 to my wishlist, along with the 17” MacBook Pro that I need to replace my deceased PowerBook with. I need to be able to work away from my studio.\n\nI’ll be in touch.\n\n"

He gave a talk at the [**Type Directors Club**](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821124626/http:/www.tdc.org/) recently and compared designing a typeface to making a kit of parts, an analogy I like.\n\n"

I see on the FontLab site that if you buy Type Tool first, then upgrade to FontLab when and if you need to, you only lose about $10 compared to buying FontLab up front.\n\n"

If you eventually want to go to FontLab, but haven’t got the money now, I guess TypeTool should be a logical first step.\n\nMaybe if you ask a software specific question on the ’Build’ board, you might get answers from people other than me (read: people with more expertise).

The idea that there might be a “universal” text typeface suitable for setting anything is always alluring. Most typefaces have some characteristic, no doubt wisely, that gives them just enough personality to render them unsuitable for every single purpose. Or they lack something that would be needed. Sometimes the roman is very all-encompassisng, as far as suitable uses, but the italic has too much personality.\n\nSo my motivation to design a text typeface came from the conceit that I could create one containing every feature I ever wanted in one, while at the same time not containing anything I disliked about any of the typefaces I’ve ever used. A typeface that could be use for anything. Obviously an impossible goal, but that’s what got me started.\n\n"
