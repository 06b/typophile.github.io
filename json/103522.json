As far as history goes, to the best of my knowledge it is a basic variation of Helvetica (very similar to Helvetica Neue) created by Bitstream sometime in the last 30 years.\n\n"

Regarding history &c, there are several links and information on the 1st page of results if you Google “Swiss 721 font.” Be wary of pirate versions however. I came across several also on the 1st page of results. Be mindful not post links to them them as posting links to pirate fonts is against [Typophile’s posting guidelines](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825071948/http:/typophile.com/readme).\n\nWhere do you study?\n\n"
