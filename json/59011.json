      "content": "Thanks for the response. I already have done what you've suggested and in fact have a pretty extensive workspace ... meaning, I probably have 40 tools/commands represented by various personally-created small icons on my toolbars/panels docked at the top of my window in two rows.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is, if there's a way to prevent those toolbars/panels from being \"undocked\" and converted into floating boxes because I've reached for something at the top of the glyph window and clicked a centimeter or two above it. Every time I do that, my two toolbars either combine into one (hiding one, in effect), or the bottom toolbar is moved and becomes a square version inside the glyph window itself. It can be rather annoying.\n\n"

Most of the tools have single keys assigned to them (1 for the select tool, 3 for knife tool, 5 for the corner tool, etc.). For the ones that don't, you can assign them yourself.\n\n"
