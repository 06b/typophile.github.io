  "content": "Is there a typographical \"best practice\" for setting an academic year in a resume? Some of the things I have tried (in TeX notation [i.e. --=en-dash]):\n\n2006--2007 AY  \n2006--2007 A. Y.  \n2006--2007 Academic Year\n\n'06--'07 AY  \n'06--'07 A. Y.  \n'06--'07 Academic Year\n\n2006/2007 AY  \n2006/2007 A. Y.  \n2006/2007 Academic Year\n\n'06/'07 AY  \n'06/'07 A. Y.  \n'06/'07 Academic Year\n\nMy main concern was that the en-dash would mean all of 2006 and 2007, being somewhat contradictory to the \"Academic Year\" part, and that the slash would be bad typographical practice without kerning. If I use the slash, would it be better to use old-style figures or lining? Space is a bit of a concern, so I really would like to avoid using the \"Academic Year\" version.\n\nThanks for any help you can provide.\n\n",
