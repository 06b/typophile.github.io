I would say, “something needs to be done” but I fear that might result in another half-dozen name table fields that need to get added to fonts.\n\nAnyway: I’m not sure if you’ve seen Thomas Phinney’s bit on this which includes some screen captures for FontLab settings: [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/Font%20names.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173049/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/Font%20names.pdf \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/Font%20names.pdf\") ... it might help but don’t be surprised if there are still some oddities in some application somewhere.\n\nAlso: under Mac OS X you may find it helpful to delete your font caches and reboot. In fact that may be the problem, especially if you’ve been installing and uninstalling your fonts as you work on them. The FontNuke app at [http://www.jamapi.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173049/http:/www.jamapi.com/ \"http://www.jamapi.com/\") is useful for this.\n\nGood luck.\n\n"

And if you find this hard to believe, ask the [Type & Media](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173049/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Education) or the [Reading](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173049/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Education) students. I was over there a couple of months ago giving a workshop on how to use the AFDKO tools, and we probably spent like 10 minutes(!!) setting up the naming. And half of that time was actually just typing.\n\nAre you planning to attend [TypeCon](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173049/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/TypeCon) this year? I’m going to give a full-day workshop there about using some of the AFDKO tools.\n\n\\> _This topic is probably one of the more challenging things facing font developers_\n\nI completely agree. Getting the ’name’ table right is not an easy task. Fortunately there are (free) tools out there that simplify the whole process. Have I mentioned the [AFDKO](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706173049/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/AFDKO)? :) I just don’t understand why FontLab hasn’t taken advantage of this yet...\n\n"

That font will only contain certain values from the fields on FontLab’s Font Info panes.
