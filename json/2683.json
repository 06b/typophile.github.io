I read somewhere that it's very important to check the counterpunch (make the font white on a black background and check the curves again).   \nWho does this, how do you do that and how important is it?   \n   \nI've seen that with my font I need to do that. What's the most efficient way to do that?   \n   \nThanx,   \nRen�\n\n",

      "content": "James, I personally don't think that's completely true. A lot depends upon HOW you look at it and what you EXPECT to see. If you see it upsidedown (think about a brochure laying on a table), you'll be surprised about how it will look then. Then it might not 'look good' anymore. Invert a character and you'll have the same effect. A lot of mistakes you will not see in small sizes. But use it big and you can be shocked.   \n   \nYou expect to see a perfect font, so automatically I think the brain 'corrects' the mistakes. It's the same with grammar mistakes. Some you don't see because your brain correctes them, but they are there.   \n   \nIt's in the nature of fonts that there are a lot of ways on how to apply them. If a font contains some very small curve-mistakes that would mean that you limit the user in their creative application of it, because they could not use it bigger. That a font might have been optimized for small sizes does not mean that you can't use it big, or inverted, or vertical, or only the counterpunches, etc. I for myself do that very often in my work.   \n   \nSo for specific applications I agree with Dukes statement, but it seem to me to be only half of the truth. In this statement I miss the 'but...'. ;-)   \n   \nRen�\n\n"

My paraphrasing Duke here was in response to the original thrust of the thread that reversing your glyph would some how show you the countershape in a more critical environment. Personally I dont think any one enviroment is better than the other to evaluate a glyph shape, except for the environment that the type is designed to function in.   \n   \nI think a common mistake is evaluating a glyph at some monsterous size when the type face is suppose to function at 10-48 point. After drawing, proof at the size range of intended use. And then, if it looks good, it is good.\n\n"

He would send off the drawings and wait a couple weeks for proofs of the actual type to come back so that he could finally judge his work at the size for which is was actually intended. As a shortcut, he would sometimes use a reducing glass (opposite of a magnifying glass) to try to get some impression of how the letters he was drawing would look in their final size.   \n   \nBut that was a different time and a different technology.

In particular, if you have two signs side-by-side, one black on white and one white on black (or similar high contrast colours), you need to make the letters in the white on black slightly heavier and sturdier in order for them to _look_ the same weight as the black on white.\n\n"
