A nice mix. I guess I'd say that affected my work by giving me the motivation and tools to easily experiment outside of the computer. Granted, a lot of what we did there ended up with the letterpressed aesthetic, which for us was a nice selling point.\n\n"

      "content": "\"So, would it be fair to say clients (particularly those with a knowledge of pritning processes) would prefer something that's been pressed as opposed to digitally printed?\"   \n   \nI think that's too broad of a statement. Clients come in all shapes and sizes ;o)   \n   \nA lot of our clients were actually other design firms that, obviously, knew of printing methods and media.   \n   \nThat said, we also had a lot of wedding/event invite type stuff where people were, IMHO, looking for something more unique. Not necessarily in look, but in terms of production. ie, it added a bit of perceived value to the piece when there was that tactile response (the impression of the type, the thicker paper stock, etc.) We had to hit the paper hard because people wanted to emphasize the fact that it was letterpressed. True letterpress shouldn't really advertise the fact that it was letterpressed.   \n   \nAlso, folks just found it fun to dig through the type cabinents.   \n   \n\"Also, when Microsoft was founded how substantially did this affect graphic design?\"   \n   \nIn terms of producing work, not at all.   \n   \n\" Also why was the introduction the apple so popular?\"   \n   \nBecause it was unlike anything else at the time. It had a mouse, you moved the mouse and it did things on screen. The original apps were geared toward the visual arts. It had the first set of fonts that weren't monospaced, etc.\n\n"

      "content": "Well I managed to write the introduction to my essay, only another 2000+ words to go! I managed to get an extension until Monday, though.   \n   \nWhy have we seen a return to the handmade over recent years?   \n   \nI recently read that the average graphic designer spends about seventy five percent of his or her time working in front of a Mac. I�m not entirely sure how accurate this statement is and it certainly can be argued that every designer works in a different way to the next, yet the point remains that however much time is spent rectifying spacial errors in Quark, or attempting to attain the correct white balance in Photoshop, it is a significantly greater amount of time than thirty years ago.   \n The last monotype composing machine was built thirty years ago in 1975, the same year Microsoft was formed. From then on, the use of computers within the field of graphic arts has rapidly increased, however it was not until the introduction of the Apple Macintosh and �wysiwyg� interfaces in 1984 that computers began to really realise their potential. Primarily many designers were sceptical as, in terms of quality, the end results being produced by early systems were inferior to traditional printing methods such as letterpress, in the case of typography. The introduction of Apple�s �what-you-see-is-what-you-get� system replaced the need for complex programming skills. For the first time a computer system was available that was equipped to cater for the needs of one working within the visual arts. For the the first time the work under production could be viewed on screen, added to this was the introduction of the mouse, which enabled the designer to manipulate their work on screen whilst it was being made. For the first time technology was challenging traditional graphic design processes.   \n As technology and digital printing methods continue to improve and evolve it could be argued that the existence of traditional printing and mark making is now constantly going to be under threat and that the threat will cease to subside. With this in mind why is it that, especially in recent years, we have seen a return to the handmade? If traditional techniques no longer assimilates to quality then what purpose do they serve?   \n   \nI also have to do an animation by Friday..why do I always leave things to the last minute?!\n\n"

There are plenty of books at your local library, and sites on the internet if a library is not an option, that tell the story of personal computers, and the software programs, that had an effect on the way typesetting and graphic design work in general was done.   \n   \nGet thee to a library, Matthew! :-)\n\n"
