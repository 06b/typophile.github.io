  "content": "I've been asked to recreate a logo and I can't place the face...I know the \"script\" is Caflisch Script Web Pro and I thought the boldface was a Futura or Frutiger, but the G isn't consistent with Futura and the S and C isn't correct with Frutiger, but close. I can tell from the weight at the bottom of the U that it has been manually \"scrunched\" but need to nail the ID and no one else knows. So, I come to those more knowledgeable than I. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nrick\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418174809im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Montgomery2_6209.jpg)\n\n",
