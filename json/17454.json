The client asked for a “clean, fresh, open minded feel”, but it should also feel somehow “technical.” More importantly I have a question if there already is such logo (since it seems like pretty obvious, but appealing idea.) I appreciate any leads or comments. Thanks.

Besides, there’s not much here looking “technical” to me: wouldn’t it be possible to use another typeface ? This one, with the two shades of blue, reminds me of an optician’s sign.

I think it starts mostly from the size & stroke relationship of the circle itself—perhaps get that looking right first, and then choose an appropriate type.\n\nJust to throw an idea out there: what about a solid circle and a negative R? With a careful application of a “glass highlight” you might have something better. I say “careful” because a cutely “illustrated” treatment is right out.\n\nThe concept, here, is _very_ smart and completely appropriate. Good job.\n\n"

I agree that the relationship between the letter and the circle has to be resolved (I think I should push it a little more) The typeface is Engravers Gothic and I chose it because of it’s extended character (so that I could accomodate the “F”, “R” with the intersecting circle. I’d however prefer typeface with thinner strokes in its thin cut for “F” and combine it with medium or bold cut for the “R” (I welcome suggestions). The mark is meant for the website for now with a possibility of stationery application later. I’ll exploree the relationship between the mark and type more. Thanks again. Jan\n\n"

Then you may want to change the colour of the magnifying device (again making it a single colour). I’m sure that some will say that will take the charm away from it. Agree with comments on the S. Also I would try not to get bogged down with the double occurence of the letters RES in both words. It might work it might not. Trying to force it maybe constraining you with the layout of the type.\n\n"

I’m aligning the RES parts of the words, because I’d like to use other complimentary words on the website that have RES in it (address, respondents, corespondence, press room etc.) under the logo for each section. Plus I thought it worked with the “research” topic (looking for and organizing results according to similarities). I tried one knock out version, but even though it might be visually stronger I think I’m loosing the “magnified” effect there a little bit (what do you guys think?).

Right now the type and mark are competing quite a bit, because they are so simliar.\n\nOne strategy: try a heavier weight for “FRESH RESEARCH”, taking the point size down to about half of what you have now, and letterspacing it to lighten it up again. If you flush it left and rag the E of “FRESH” on the left sidebearing of your mark, it should lock up pretty nicely with the shape; I expect the line of the R’s leg would lead to the end of “RESEARCH”, which is almost happening now.\n\nTim is right that you are losing the metaphor slightly, in exchange for a stronger form. Try putting a gentle crescent knock-out on the circle and see how that strikes you?\n\n"

I have liked this logo concept since the original post, but I’m still not feelin’ it.\n\nSomebody suggested exploring alternative typefaces earlier. I think your Avenir selection is a good alternative to your original choice, but have you considered any options that change the overall feel? Right now, it does have a technical feel, but from your client’s request to use warm colors (not necessarily a hot red) I wonder if a warmer, more human feel to the logo would be appropriate.\n\nA couple of suggestions might be to use a softer typeface (not necessarily Meta, but something like it) and warm colors vs. hot (I believe in sociology, “red” indicates heat, violence, power, etc.).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415083517im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FreshIdea.jpg)\n\nI didn’t attempt to recreate your logo, as you’ve done a great job with your concept, but maybe this could spark some ideas.\n\nIn regard to the lens glare, I wonder if decreasing the curve/arc would help flatten it out. Right now, it looks like a sphere to me.\n\nAloha!\n\n"

I tend to gravitate towards color combinations that have a neutralizing base color to use as accent or vice versa. Of course there are instances where I go against this.\n\nScott’s version of the logo had a cool gray with the warm pumpkin, but because it had too much cyan/blue in it it grayed out the pumpkin color. Jan’s version with the warm gray version also detracted from the pumpkin because I see too much magenta/red in the color. The last version above has a gray that is basically a neutral and I think acts as a counterpoint to the warmer color.\n\nI miss my color theory books. :^/\n\n"
