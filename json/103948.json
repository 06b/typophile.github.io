  "content": "Hi!\n\nWilhelm Pischner designed Neuzeit Grotesk for Stempel AG in the late thirties.  \nPart of a self-initiated research, I've been looking for a portrait photography of him without any success so far.  \nI've asked Linotype, the Klingspor Museum and the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt. Any of these institutions has seen a picture of this designer. Before enquiring at Offenbach's city archives, where he was born, I decided to post on this forum.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nMathieu Christe\n\n",
