In the process the file goes from windows to OS9. From word to quark. I lose all my euro symbols. At the momment I have to manually replace every symbol, and as a result some get missed and the paper obviously suffers. Are there any simple ways to stop this. I suspect it maybe that the version of Frutiger I'm running does not contain a symbol. I could manually add one in fontographer, but a little unsure.\n\n",

I'm not exactly sure why I care, in this case. In terms of gut feeling, it's just not honest. When you use a forum so clearly for your own benefit, it's only right to present yourself as who you are. A community benefits from mutual trust and humility, otherwise it's a dark alley where shady deals are made.   \n   \nThe impression I get here is that the person doesn't want to appear not to know how to fix the problem. If this is true, it's the type of insecure manipulation I myself wouldn't want to encourage. On the other hand, this could very well be a mistaken impression - but it couldn't have happened without the anonymous presentation.   \n   \nLet's make Typophile -or anything else we care about- a reflection of our personal ideals. That is community.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

A quick Google search finds (from [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20090826051130/http:/www1.tip.nl/~t876506/charsets.html)):   \n   \n\"Another problem is the Euro currency symbol. In most of the new Macintosh fonts the general currency symbol has been replaced by the Euro symbol and in most of the new Windows fonts a formerly unused position got the Euro symbol. There is even a Unicode position defined for the Euro symbol: 20AC hexadecimal, which is the same as 8364 decimal.\"   \n   \nThe Word import filter on the Observer's Quark is probably too old to catch this.   \n   \n-----   \n   \nRegarding the anonymity: In most online communities using real names is not the norm. I expect that someone young enough to grow up with the Internet (most college students) is used to using a nickname online.   \n   \nFor someone young who will probably be using the net for the rest of their work and personal life, it makes sense to separate identites online. Could you imagine a future employer, spouse, social (or professional) enemy, etc. being able to find every little scrap of writing you'd done over the last twenty years by searching for your name? People have been using net in volume for long enough for this already to be a problem. I've read about a corporate employee that was fired because of a posting he made five years previous regarding his personal life. (Sorry, I don't remember enough to find the news story.)   \n   \nI've been lurking here for about six months and haven't signed up because I rarely feel the need to post. (Hi, all.) I'll never use my last name here because I don't want to leave a paper-trail because of this general principle. I've known people who have had problems with Internet stalkers. The \"Observer\" likely has nothing to hide, but feels uncomfortable giving out real-life info to a bunch of strangers.\n\n"
