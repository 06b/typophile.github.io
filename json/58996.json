Bell Gothic (Chauncey Griffith) is the first typeface to put serifs on sans cap I, 1937, to avoid confusion between I and 1/l, in low-quality printing of telephone directories.\n\n2. DIN signage face has lower case \"l\" with tail, 1930s, to avoid confusion between I and l when both are rendered by a monowidth device, such as a technical pen or a router.\n\n2. Orator and OCR-B are 1960s sans serif typewriter faces which include I and l with serifs, this time to \"fill up\" the empty letterspace in a monowidth system.\n\n3. Meta has \"l\" with tail, 1985 (?), an homage to DIN?\n\n3. Officina picks up the \"office typewriter\" look and repeats the Meta \"l\" tail (same designer, Erik Spiekermann), 1990.\n\n4. Verdana and Trebuchet, 1994, but this time the serifs serve to differentiate I and 1/l when all are hinted to the same pixel stem width and height, and the visual cue of subtly different stem dimensions that exists in print is not operative.\n\nIn general, these faces were designed for \"output devices\" which lacked the precise resolution and sophisticated spacing nuances of good quality letterpress and offset printing.\n\nSo type for a hand-held device fits the scenario.\n\n"
