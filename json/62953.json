As I am tyring to become more serious about my design work and are interested in becoming a better designer, owning a few of these (which I didnt even know existed) hopefully would benefit me.\n\nI see the Fontbook is availabe, does any know what year this was last updated?  \n [http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091012074055/http:/www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/\")\n\nI also see the Font Bureau Third Edition Specimen Book but that was published in 2001.  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/books/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091012074055/http:/www.fontbureau.com/books/ \"http://www.fontbureau.com/books/\")\n\nCan anyone recommend any other printed referenes or free online PDF’s etc.\n\nAny help would be great\n\n",
