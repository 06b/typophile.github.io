This one is just a plus sign flipped on it’s side, I’m trying to decide if that makes it a little more interesting (since it isn’t a ×) or just makes it look like bad design.\n\nThanks for pointing out the 0 not overlapping enough. It matches the 8, so I think it’s an illusion caused by the massive serif on 1. I’ll probably scale the 0 up a tiny bit.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071118044307im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/8x10logob_5240.png)\n\n"
