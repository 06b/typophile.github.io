The programmers have been working long and hard, and we're going to do some long-needed revamps and improvements.   \n   \nWe'll take it down tomorrow, Tuesday, 17 December at 5pm PST. A brand new Typophile Forums will open up on January 6, 2003.   \n   \nHere's a taste of what you can expect in the new forums:   \n   \n NO FRAMES! (Everybody now, \"Hooray!!!!\")   \n New Forum organization/architecture   \n Improved interface   \n User rank & activity stats next to each post   \n Define your own user icon!   \n Automated forgotten password recovery!   \n Exclusive private forums!   \n Downloadable font Betas!   \n One-click Image & attachment uploads!   \n and much more!   \n   \nWe're taking advantage of the slow holiday time to make the upgrades. We hope you'll join us in January to break in the new system.   \n   \nIn the meantime, you can join us in some lively conversations [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020192459/http:/typophile.com/chat).   \n   \nHappy Holidays!   \n   \nJared and Joe   \nTypophile\n\n",
