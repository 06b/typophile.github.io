I suspect it was likely a privately commissioned typeface from Ford, but wanted to run it by the experts here to see if anyone could match it to a known available font before telling my client it would need to be hand-drawn. Or failing that, if anyone could suggest something very close, if it comes to that. Thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305101212im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RPM-Gauge-cropped_4877.jpg)\n\n",
