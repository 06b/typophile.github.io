  "content": "Hi typophiles.\n\nI'm in a hurry and I need a script font, that needs to be the following:\n\n1. Must look handwritten with a pen (no explicit caligraphy and as little stroke variation as possible)\n2. Must serve masculine and feminine signatures.\n3. Must be readable\n4. Must have central/eastern european characters (čČšŠžŽćĆđĐ)\n5. Must have dignity, because it will be used for signatures of strong personality and successful individuals\n\nI'm having some difficulty choosing one. It also looks there's not much choice around. There's lot of caligraphic script fonts. Or scripts written with caligraphic pens... But not my required style fonts...\n\nI'm seriously flirting with [Ivana Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212612/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/ivana-script/). Does it stand my measures?\n\nWhat would you suggest?\n\n",

I would expect of a Pro font to have all kinds of letters in it as they are with ITC or Adobe... Unfortunatelly this one doesn't have čČ, ćĆ, đĐ as you already mentioned anyway.\n\nAnd I think that Handsome font may not be the best as false signeture font for let's say... Bill Gates. I don't think it would look legitimate. Anyone could tell it's made up.\n\nAnyway. Thanks and welcome any other suggestions.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

If the signatures are in the same document or in different documents that can be viewed at the same time, any typeface you are going to use can't do the trick.  \nMy suggestion could sound silly since I don't know enough about your project, but maybe you could ask people you know to write down the signatures and scan the best results.\n\n"
