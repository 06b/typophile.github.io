The designer of more than five hundred typefaces, Frere-Jones' published work includes [Gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101062150/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/), [Whitney](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101062150/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/whitney/) and [Retina](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101062150/http:/www.typography.com/press/pr_04_09_02.html).\n\nAfter receiving his BFA in 1992 from [Rhode Island School of Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101062150/http:/typophile.com/wiki/RISD), Frere-Jones joined [Font Bureau](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101062150/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Bureau), Inc. in Boston. Over seven years as a Senior Designer, he created a number of the typefaces that are Font Bureau's best known, among them Interstate and Poynter Oldstyle & Gothic. He joined the Yale School of Art faculty in 1996 as a Critic. In 1999, he left Font Bureau to return to New York, where he began work with Jonathan Hoefler. Since working together, the two have collaborated on projects for The Wall Street Journal, Martha Stewart Living, Nike, Pentagram, GQ, Esquire, The New Times, Business 2.0, and The New York Times Magazine.\n\nHe has designed over two hundred typefaces for retail publication, custom clients, and experimental purposes. His clients have included The Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Cooper-Hewitt Museum, The Whitney Museum, The American Institute of Graphic Arts Journal, and Neville Brody. He has lectured at Rhode Island School of Design, Yale School of Art, Pratt Institute, Royal College of Art, and Universidad de las Americas. His work has been featured in How, ID, Page, and Print, and is included in the permanent collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum, London. Hoefler and Frere-Jones' collaboration has earned them profiles in _[The New York Times](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101062150/http:/www.nytimes.com/2004/10/19/nyregion/19profile.html?oref=login)_ and _[Time Magazine.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101062150/http:/www.time.com/time/innovators/design/profile_hoefler.html)_\n\n",
