  "content": "Today I designed a dingbat font with multiple layers and for some reason when the different fonts are stacked there's a vertical shift with each layer. In other words, the shapes are not vertically centered even though they do align perfectly in FontLab. Is there something I might be doing wrong?\n\nAlso, how do you define the vertical metrics in dingbat fonts?\n\n",
