      "content": "Being bang in the middle of that demographic, I would second the idea of a slab serif. Legibility is an issue for those 40+, so try to avoid text type with too fine details. Sure, you can go with a larger sized serif face (or sans), but that cuts down on the amount of copy per page, and makes things look banal. So a sturdy text face would be good, and a slab serif would be considered more sporty than say a Clarendon.
