I have been a calligrapher and lettering artist for over 40 years and I am still learning.  \nNor wishing to be disrespectful, but to think that it would be possible to design a decent italic font without a reasonable understanding of the characteristics of letters produced with a broad edged pen is expecting too much in my opinion. Seeing decent italics is one thing, understanding them is another.  \nIn my opinion if you want to design a decent italic font, then forget the computer for a while and learn basic calligraphic principles first with a pen in your hand ( might take you a few years though).\n\nIeuan Rees [http://homepage.mac.com/ieuanrees](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906194306/http:/homepage.mac.com/ieuanrees \"http://homepage.mac.com/ieuanrees\")\n\n"
