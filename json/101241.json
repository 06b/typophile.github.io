  "content": "I am working on a historical novel set in 18th century Birmingham, England, about, among other things, John Baskerville. I am looking for an illustration (or other image...photos of replicas?) or a good (i.e. detailed) written description of a type-casting mould of the kind in use at this time. Can you help? Print and typographical history are just part of the ongoing research for this project, so any other recommended resources on the subject--great books, websites, etc.--would be much appreciated. So much to learn....\n\n",

Maybe that's actually a bit of romanticism, or maybe you only do that if you're making thousands of sorts a day...\n\nhhp\n\n"
