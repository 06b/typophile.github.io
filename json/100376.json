Fortunately business cards are a business expense, and as such part of which can treated as a tax deduction.\n\nBlackletter, when done well, does seem to separate the pretenders from the contenders. There are a lot of well known global brands that have not been seduced by the strumpets of lower case sans serif ...as tempting as they seem at first blush.\n\nn.\n\n"

And I just like say that it was a pleasure speaking with her!!\n\nI have to tell tho that as a graphic designer/creative genius I'm just a tourist amongst you typeheads so I really had no idea who Carter is ...until now. And just looking through everything substantive I could find online about the man ...wow... this guy is awesome!!\n\nthx.\n\nn.\n\nps. not saying that the sale is a done deal, I've got my standards too, somewhat...\n\n"

The other side will have a quick services mention and contact info, rendered in sans serif which I'm considering hand stamping. And the card stock edges will be painted either neon green, or red, or black.\n\nThanks again for all the assistance.\n\nn.\n\n"
