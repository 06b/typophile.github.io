All you need to do is clear your cookies from typophile.com and [www.typophile.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024045149/http:/www.typophile.com/ \"www.typophile.com\"). The new session cookies will be from .typophile.com which will keep you logged in on any sub-domain of Typophile. In fact, you can look at Typophile on nearly any sub-domain you can think of, switching willy-nilly from one page to another.\n\n",
