If you go to this URL you will see a bit of this font.  \n A similar bit of code using the name \"GothamBold\" retrieves that font elsewhere on the page.  \n What I haven't found yet is any font named \"Headline\" or with \"Headline\" in the name that matches this heading font. Does anyone know what this font is?  \n Thanks, Ray\n\n"
