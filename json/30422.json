  "content": "Hi all you typelovers.\n\nWell i'm having a strange problem.  \nAt work we used to work with the .ttf Parisine (from Porchez).  \nI bought last year the .otf version and from this day on i'm having strange problems.  \nThere i go:\n\nFirst, i'm working on a 2ghz Core Duo Intel iMac with Mac OSX.4.8.  \nI removed the .ttf Parisine, so there is just one Parisine active and this is the .otf\n\nWhat happens is that, let's say i worked on a catalogue, text is set in Parisine .otf, everything's fine...  \nThen the next day, i open up my document to continue and the text is full of ligatures that i did not want and were not there befor.  \nEverywhere the ct and st ligatures and on top of this all the dubble o's like in \"books\" are replaced by a ? in a square.  \nHmm does anybody had this befor?  \nEven if i select all the text and uncheck the ligature option in the characters palette nothing changes.  \nSometimes i just close the document and Indesign and just reopen it and everything is fine again but that works like 1/20.\n\nAlso i'm not the only one having this problem here at work.\n\nWhere can this come from?\n\nThanks a lot for any help,\n\nGilles\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [example.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100711093525/http:/typophile.com/files/example.png) | 47.29 KB |\n\n",

We never sell any TrueType versions of any retail fonts, so Parisine in TTF is a stranger for us…\n\n"
