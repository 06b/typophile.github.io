What typographic treatments lend themselves for effective heavy metal-ness?   \n   \nFeel free to post examples, or throw out ideas. And Yes, they have an umlaut over the \"a\", just for kicks.   \n   \njb\n\n",

(the obvious first, right?)-- Headbanger's Ball -- The \"gnarliest\" black letter you can find -- and less rotunda-schwabacher shapes more textura-fraktur -- the more mediaeval the better. or on second thought what about more of an \"einsturzende neubauten\" approach?   \n   \nare they heavy metal ala WASP/Judas Priest, Poison/Ratt, Motley Crue/Can't think of one, Black Sabbath (60s 70s)/Blue Oyster Cult/Led Zeppelin? Seems to me the Speed Metal bands were always a little more \"evil\" in their \"look\" while heavy metal bands seemed to have their tongues more in their cheeks. I might look at the early seventies stuff -- Zep, BOC, Black Sabbath\n\n"

      "content": "tiffany, budget is most certainly an important issue here but more important is the integrity of the client and designer. the fact is that with experience, custom display type and letterforms are really not that hard to produce. it takes a little while to become accustom to it but it is not very difficult. as a matter of fact, i just finished up a trademark for a client and it took no more then 20 minutes for one mark. trust me, i've taught many students these same skills. it's just a new way of working and seeing typography. you need to remove yourself from the computer for a few rounds. after a few revisions by hand, you can then move to the computer. the trick really is producing a couple of unique letterform directions that speak to the client and then focus your time on the pictographic elements. this is really no different then how you would approach a trademark while using a text face. the difference is the time you would spend putzing around your type collection is spent producing letterforms that do a better job of describing your client in the long run. this is only one of many reasons why you should use custom letterforms. another is the fact that you can work out all the strange and interesting relationships between individual letters more fluidly. a text face can't do this as well. it's letter combinations (except ligatures) are utilitarian. they need to work well with all other letters in the alphabet. the fact is that they don't always do such a great job of this. custom letterforms work in and around each other accenting and stressing or pairing and differentiating with fluid ease. this is why most of the best marks in design were produced in an era where designers could not be lazy. their only option was to produce trademarks by hand. in most cases if you could not do this you had trouble even pursuing a career in design. the computer has really not made this any easier. it has only illustrated the point that a text face is not a display face.   \n   \nnad x, i'm glad you agree. but the fact is that even with so many text faces to choose from, a text face is still not a display face. realistically though, most people producing and using type are not very type literate and many of the cheesy \"typefaces\" out there, are in actuality display faces. if you have trouble producing your own type, many of these faces can work with some proper optical adjustments. these sorts of faces can also provide great inspiration. although i would never purchase a \"typeface\" from t-26, they do in fact have many creative ideas in regard to unique or interesting letterforms. my suggestion is to use these as creative inspiration but not as a final design for a client. as far as the nike mark is concerned don't give it to much credit. the spacings between the \"n\" \"i\" and \"k\" are way to small. that said, the fact is that this mark was most likely done in the way i have described. the version you are speaking of was designed prior to the computer revolution. just because a mark looks simple does not mean it's execution was simple. masterful works usually only look simple.   \n   \nas a last note (i think i already mentioned this) the use of the word logo is incorrect. logo is short for logotype. a logotype is a word mark. most trademarks are not just word marks. the correct term is trademark with the appropriate abbreviation being mark. this is more then just semantics. it's like calling a bicycle a car. though both are forms of transportation a car is very different from a bicycle.   \n   \nsorry for the long post...\n\n"

      "content": "bj, are you kidding me... i'm amazed that you would pose such a ridiculous question. but to answer, i think you're completely missing the point. no typeface can account for every individual letter pairing possible. this alone should be enough to answer your question but i will go further. because it is really much larger than this.   \n   \nit really is less crucial that the type is unique in its letterforms (though important, this is only a side benefit). there are plenty of custom or hand done trademarks that use mundane faces like helvetica for instance. because they are done by hand means they are done with a keen sense of artistry, with emphasis placed on the letter pairings found in the word. the time spent crafting each letterform in it's relation to other letterforms pushes these marks into a realm that no type set text face can match. the importance of doing marks by hand goes beyond originality and into craft. it's the fine crafting of each letterform into a piece of display type.   \n   \nthis craft is also about not being lazy. typographers of the past knew many things that we are losing today due to ignorance and computer convenience. the more you discard your craft and treat it idly the more standards of excellence we lose, and the bigger the onslaught of ignorant graphic design hacks we create. if creating a trademark is as simple as turning on my computer and typing out something in a text face, than everyone with a computer and one hundred free typefaces is a graphic designer. all you are doing is making this paradigm more and more acceptable.   \n   \nyou may think i'm an idealist but we should all be maintaining these standards. their implementation helps guarantee that we all have jobs.\n\n"

Of course   \nyou don't just roll a font out of the box. Of course   \nyou look at letter pairings, positive/negative space, ligatures,   \ncolor and weight, among a host of other things.   \nOf course you ought to sketch stuff out, but   \nnot in the gutterball instance, for us onlookers.   \nWe didn't set craft or artistry back and we weren't being   \nlazy. We were having   \nfun with a few fonts that have never seen the light   \nof day.   \n   \nThere's nothing wrong with being an idealist, but it's   \nthe arrogant manner in which you spread your recycled   \ngospel that is so grating. Humility is a wonderful thing.   \nDo they teach that up on the hill?   \n   \nbj   \n   \nI love Art Center, btw.

A degree of wandering from the topic is one thing but this is getting silly.   \n   \nAs briefly as possible:   \nTrademark is not _always_ the correct term, esp. when trade is not the primary purpose.   \nIn cases where trademark is not the correct term, logo may or may not be the correct term.   \n\\>\\>webster is progressive   \nYes and Oxford about as staid as they come, but both accept that logo is not restricted only to type. Oxford even goes so far as to suggest that logo isn't always an abbreviation of logotype, but can be an abreviation of logogram etc.   \n   \nBJ \\>\\>Steve is not incorrect in his Gutterball/they construction.   \nBJ, I don't think Jay(W) has that in mind as the error.   \nI think that's too subtle - he just hasn't read the words properly, or he hasn't grasped the idea of saying 'this _may_ be the case BUT I don't think so'. He's a serial misinterpreter, I think he uses miscomprehension as rant fuel or something   \n   \nOK, that's enough.   \nJay(W), answer this however you like, you tempted me into a reply before, I already wish I had gone with my instincts and ignored you.   \n   \nNow, having used up lots of this thread on nothing, I'm going to give some more thought to the original question - 'What typographic treatments lend themselves for effective heavy metal-ness?'\n\n"
