You can check out logo on the website above.\n\nMy plan is to make minimal intervention on the logo itself - im trying to make it look more \"modern\" so i'm looking for some serif Bodoni or Didot lookalike.. If someone has a suggestion i'll be happy to hear it\n\n",

Yeah, you lose some of the symmetry, but then when they inevitably make the boat captain's hats for the club, they can emphasize the \"P\". Maybe with little laurels.\n\n-Andrew Welfle\n\n"
