That is kind of the point of this particular article.\n\nThe premise of 19 combinations was based on 19 top fonts that I researched. Old, fuddy-duddy, or what-have-you, these ARE the fonts that most designers use on a routine basis.\n\nRead the original article (well, glance anyway):\n\n[http://bonfx.com/19-top-fonts-most-preferred-by-graphic-designers-from-a...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052732/http:/bonfx.com/19-top-fonts-most-preferred-by-graphic-designers-from-around-the-web/ \"http://bonfx.com/19-top-fonts-most-preferred-by-graphic-designers-from-around-the-web/\")\n\nThe intro reads as follows:\n\n\"Out of the huge number of fonts used by graphic designers, there really is quite a small pool of fonts consistently chosen over and over again by graphic designers as their 'most used'. I took some time to search out as many 'top fonts for graphic designers' search results (plus variations) that I had time to visit. I spent several hours visiting blogs, forums, magazine websites, etc..\"\n\nThat said, post a link back to something you've done that could possibly slip into the list I came up with.

That is all.\n\nMy sample was big enough so that there was no meaningful (to me) distinction in the \"long tail\" of self-reporting \"favorite font\" data I could find on the web after a certain point. My own statistics showed that after the first 19 fonts (20 and beyond, on my list) the \"tail\" shot out and I concluded my data was broad enough. I was not interested in doing more than that, since I wasn't interested in the tail so much as the consensus.\n\nIf you simply took the excellent results from the survey in the first article at Abduzeedo, and got rid of the long tail, you will find an extremely close overlap with my own research, perhaps close to 90%. And that is just with 17 designers.\n\nThe results from the second article, primarily based on sales, confirm nearly the same.\n\nOne last tidbit I just found from 2009:\n\n[http://szstudiodesign.com/wordpress/typography/best-selling-fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052732/http:/szstudiodesign.com/wordpress/typography/best-selling-fonts \"http://szstudiodesign.com/wordpress/typography/best-selling-fonts\")  \n===  \n\"According to fonts.com and fontshop.com the following fonts were best sellers in 2009:\n\nArial • ITC Franklin Gothic • Benton Sans • FF Meta • FF Din • Eurostile • Gill Sans • DIN Next • Avenir • Futura • Frutiger • Helvetica • Interstate • Akzidenz Grotesk • Univers • Trade Gothic • the Sans • Neo • SoHo • ITC Avant Garde Gothic • Rotis • Zapfino • Optima • Estillo • Helvetica Neue • Estilo Script • Waza™ • Olicana Smooth OT • Louisiana • Metroscript OT\n\nThere are many more **classic fonts** than I would have imagined.\"  \n===\n\nYou'll once again notice, based on recent sales stats from the vendors mentioned, the overlap with my own data is significant, as well as the reliance by many font purchasers on classic typefaces.\n\nSo, my data, while not clinical in a formal sense, are nonetheless devoid of willy-nilly spuriousness. It does reveal that most people buy boring, classic fonts though, according to many sources and not just mine.\n\n"

Three of my own personal modern favorites aren't on the list only because the data put them in the \"long tail\" outside of my scope:\n\nMuseo  \nGotham  \nMrs. Eaves\n\nI went to MyFonts and found the 50 bestsellers for the last month (May 2010). If you compare this to the 19 I found to the MyFonts bestsellers list, you find:\n\n(\\* = overlap in top 20)  \n(\\*\\* = overlap in top 50)\n\n\\*\\* Futura  \nGaramond  \n\\* Frutiger  \n\\* Helvetica / Helvetica Neue  \nMinion  \nBodoni  \nClarendon  \nFranklin Gothic  \n\\* Univers  \nGill Sans  \n\\* Akzidenz Grotesk  \n\\* Avenir  \nCaslon  \n\\*\\* Myriad  \nFF Din  \n\\*\\* Trade Gothic  \nBaskerville  \nWarnock  \nBembo\n\nThe Hoefler and Frere-Jones types still didn't register outside of the top 20 in my research, though I'm pretty sure Interstate was in the top 40 somewhere, as was Gotham. I was kind of surprised that Gotham wasn't in the top 20 actually.\n\nIt's a \\*very\\* good assumption that many designers get typefaces like Arno, Warnock, and Myriad with Adobe products and/or Mac OS. While not exciting, they are versatile and above all - included in your Adobe purchase and thus likely to occupy a soft spot in the hearts of many new designers.\n\nThe data is skewed towards corporate and otherwise free or low-cost classic faces due to distribution channels for them, like Adobe, having sheer numerical dominance. It's hard to compete with free. But unless the sales data at MyFonts is misleading, people are still going out of their way with cash money in hand to buy some of these oldies for reasons attributed to the overall usefulness of the typeface. If you are on a limited budget and are just starting out and want to acquire a type library, it makes good sense to get a Helvetica Neue expanded collection going. Gotta start somewhere.\n\n\"Why are you biased against contemporary, independent foundries?\"\n\nAgain, I'm just reporting the fact, not setting an agenda.\n\n\"Are you suggesting that designers' best practice is to stick with fonts from corporate publishers, that they acquired through bundling?\"\n\nI'm not suggesting that is a best practice, but I'm reporting it as a matter-of-fact practice.\n\nI think a best practice is to encourage designers to spend money on new typefaces especially from independent foundries, like they would on music gear if they were musicians, or on paints and materials if they were artists.\n\nI will be doing new research and blog content focused on independent foundries in the coming months.\n\nIt just happens that the last type book I purchased a few weeks back, \"Typeface: Classic Typography for Contemporary Design\" by Tamye Riggs is a real delight to read. The list of typefaces she works with contains 46 typefaces, all of which are on the lists and research I did. She got a lot of flack from her \"fellow type fanatics\" about what should and shouldn't be on the list.\n\nHer concluding sentence in the intro rings true for me:\n\n\"What is included is ultimately not the preference of the authors - the content evolved organically from a thorough exploration of typography in the design world.\"\n\nHer research mirrors mine nearly identically. She did more research than I, so I'll defer to her list, even though I did my research before her book came out earlier this year.\n\nBut the second paragraph of the intro is even better:\n\n\"I could see tremendous potential for such a type book. Let me preface this by saying that I'm a big fan of living type designers and I support their efforts as much as possible. But while plenty of graphic designers employ new typefaces in their projects, there is still a tremendous amount of stunning work being produced using type that originated in the twentieth centuries and much earlier.\"\n\nI couldn't say it any better myself, so I won't try!\n\n"

The problem, though, is that the other aspects (facets of the \"long tail\") are indeed much, much harder to represent. It's like trying to quantify \"The top 10 independent Bed & Breakfast Inns\": it just can't be done because they are so localized and specialized, that \"top\" doesn't apply.
