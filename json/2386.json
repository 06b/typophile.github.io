That's how he cut his teeth, so to speak, in type. I think he used to give demonstrations at ATypI conferences. If I'm not mistaken, there was a plan to have him do a rubylith-cutting demo at this summer's TypeCon in Toronto, but at the last minute they couldn't get his scalpels through airport security. (We use off-the-rack X-actos here in the States, but Dave uses his own custom, hand-crafted blades.)   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

I would suggest that \"unity\" implies the combination of site and sound and there are enough interesting charicatures to use them graphically. an example the dot over the eye could be and eye, the u or the y could be changed into sound type shapes.   \nbut over all you want to have unity with site and sound. it goes hand in hand, eye to eye, and mouth to mouth. these are all important issues in comunication\n\n"
