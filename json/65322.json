  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am designing a logo for Prestige Promotions and Limo Hire. They are wanting the brand to be stylish and classy. I am looking for a font that would capture this idea, and was hoping to get some suggestions, the client has a small budget so I wont be able to spend big mony on fonts.\n\nBelow is some added info of the services the company offers\n\nSo basically the business offers 3 services:\n\n1: Promotional services - The best promotional models available to promote maximum impact for any event.  \n2: Luxury Vehicle Hire - Top of the range vehicles to transport you in true star style to any event.  \n3.

You donâ€™t need a big type system for a logo, but just one or two font styles.\n\nIt is contradictory to provide a luxury service, but not to have a few Dollars for one or two font styles.\n\n"
