This is matching upto 92% only problem is that \"the letter \"\" t \"\" is different\".\n\nI have looked at Gill Sans, Stag Sans, Gill Sans MT but no luck.\n\nalso you can visit \" [http://www.southernductworkservices.co.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826010518/http:/www.southernductworkservices.co.uk/)\"\n\nto help further.\n\nThanks Again.\n\n"

I find you the most honest in that case, Thanks.\n\nThanks  \nRegards,  \nHash\n\n"
