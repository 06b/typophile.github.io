  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI just completed a large document (288 pgs) in In-Design 6 and tried to publish it to PDF. I know you heard this before. Adobe refused to embed the font, which of course is mandatory. The font is a TTF created in 2001.\n\nI have written permission to use the font commercially and need to find a way to legally remove the do-not-embed restriction. I contacted the creator of the font, and he did not realize he even put in the restriction and does not know how to remove it. He does not even have the program he used to create the font. Yikes!\n\nChanging the font would take weeks even though I only use it in chapter heads and drop caps. I am also afraid outlining would put things out of whack. It needs to work in print and in multiple electronic forms.\n\nI have scoured the web and have tried all sorts of apps. Some did not work, and I could not even figure out how to use a few others.\n\nAny ideas on how I can get myself out of this fix? I get addicted to fonts and will resist changing it since it so perfectly relates to the subject matter of the text.\n\nHelp.\n\nsuzanneski\n\n",

      "content": "Hello,\n\nSorry to be so late getting back to you all, but I have been swamped, figuratively and literally. (I live in Louisiana.)\n\nThanks for the responses. I tried asking the font creator to fix it. However, he did not know how to fix it and does not even have a program necessary for the task. This is the only font he ever created.\n\nLuckily, someone from this group emailed me privately with great info. Even though he had rescued me with the information I needed, it stressed me because I have become handicapped by Windows and am no longer sure of command line stuff.\n\nThis is the really amazing part. I emailed High-logic, the folks who sell the FontCreator program. I was so desperate that I was willing to buy the program just for one use, to fix this font. However I did not have to. They volunteered to fix the font for me for free so long as I would send them emails from the creator to verify that it was okay with him. Within hours, the font was mailed back to me, healed. I am still amazed by the fact that they trashed a chance to make a profit to help a goober. If I ever decide to add font creation to all my other endeavors, I will certainly deal with them. I got great customer service without even being a customer.\n\nThanks for all the responses and help. My appreciation for humanity has been enhanced by this frustrating situation and caring people.\n\nHappy Mardi Gras.  \nSuzanneski\n\n"

Make sure you first save a copy without creating outlines (because I don't think you can undo). Then you have made images of your text and you should be able to export the file to pdf. Does this make sense? Best, Anthony\n\n"

Therefore, you are violating perhaps not the letter of the EULA, but certainly its spirit.\n\nEULAs tend to lag behind technical possibilities -- that is, if 'just outline the fonts' becomes common practice, it'll surely get mentioned that is allowed/not allowed next time.\n\n"

This saves the client from needing to license and install fonts, and it guarantees that the logo will appear exactly as you designed it.\n> \n> If your client needs to install and use the fonts themselves, they’ll need to license the fonts for their own use, which they can do through this site.\n\nThe problem with embedding the font is that it can be extracted from pdf or postscript files. However, with current technology, fonts need the opentype tables to produce a decent output and those tables are not embedded in printouts. Maybe I am wrong but I would expect that with current technology, trying to extract a font from a pdf file is outdated and that the problems with technological advances come more from web fonts and fonts for e-pub than from those for desktop publication.\n\n"
