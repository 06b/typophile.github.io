      "content": "(I wrote these answers while Mike was posting, so there may be some redundant info.)\n\n_1. Should I test them in fontbook or suitcase I have different results in each._\n\nReinstalling a different version of the same font serially will result in problems because of the various font caches used by OS X. There are several strategies that I know of.\n\nOne is to avoid font managers and install fonts directly into the Adobe’s private Font directory ([startupvolume]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/). This means your fonts are only available to Adobe apps, but the apps don’t seem to have cache problems when you use this approach.\n\nAnother strategy is to change the name of your font every time you generate a new version. You can install such fonts any way you like, but it’s an extra step to keep changing the name.\n\n_2. Exporting as .otf. Is there any benefit to .ttf_\n\nIt depends. If you are working with Type 1 curves (beziers) there will be a conversion process when you save as TTF which you don’t have direct control over. Also, hints will be automatically converted to TT instructions, again without your direct control. Neither seems like a good way to test. If you are working in TT curves and building hints with TT instructions, that would be different.\n\n_3. Would like them to be a true cross platform font (reason for using opentype). Is this too lofty of a goal. I have heard of many problems with this. Solutions?_\n\nIt is possible. There are some good tips on the FontLab forum, written by Adam Twardoch. Look in the “Tips” section. Particularly look at the article about naming. (Mike linked to this above.)\n\n_4. My kerning pairs don’t show up when using them in an application. They are as if I didn’t make any. what am i doing wrong?_\n\nIt could be that you have not built a “kern” feature for your font. There is an option to do this automatically when you save an OpenType font. It’s better to do it manually by using Class Kerning. It’s not exactly obvious how to do this. Here is the procedure:\n\nCreate your left and right glyph classes (see the manual on how to do this). Kern the primary glyphs using the Metrics window. IMPORTANT: Make sure you don’t do kerning pairs for any other glyphs. Do “Kerning Assistance…” from the Tools menu. Click on the “Apply and Save” button. Now you will have your “kern” feature. You need to do this whenever you change the kerning.\n\nAn additional step if you have more than 100 class kerning pairs: Insert “subtable;” about every 100 lines in the kern feature definition. If you don’t, you will get erratic kerning in non-Adobe applications. I don’t know why this is, but it works.\n\nOne more thing: The old-style kerning table is ignored in CFF OTF fonts.\n\n_5. I have fonts with light, medium, bold, etc. When turning them on it doesn’t seem to recognize the whole set some are missing. I have read through many posts and the manual can only get it right with luck it seems. help?_\n\nSee Adam’s article on naming mentioned above.\n\n_6. When typing with the fonts and the weights do show up there is for example a line of text in bold and a line in regular. When they print, they come out the same, either both bold or both regular… WTF?_\n\nI’m not sure, but it is probably a caching issue. The methods I explained in my answer to question #1 should help with this.\n\n"

      "content": "The kerning table/kern feature thing gave me problems for a while when I first was using FontLab a year or two ago and generating OT fonts.\n\nMy understanding is that kerning tables are not saved with CFF OTF fonts, although I think it is possible. Even so, you don’t want to do it.\n\nAlso, look at your kern feature after it is generated. If you see any pairs which directly reference glyphs. For example:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;pos A T -30;\n\ninstead of\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;pos @\\_kernlA @\\_kernrT -69;\n\n\\_kernlA and \\_kernrT are classes; A and T are just glyph names. For reasons I don’t understand, if any entries in your kern feature are NOT classes, there will be problems in some applications. The way to remove the non-class pairs is to go through your kerning pairs (open a Metrics window; click on the little K to activate kerning; click on the “Kerning Dialog” button to the right of the button with the red X) and delete any pairs in which either side is not the primary glyph of a class (that’s the one which comes first in the class and has a tick mark [‘] next to it).\n\nAfter doing this, redo the Apply and Save thing. Keep doing this until you only have class-based kerning pairs in the kern feature.\n\n"
