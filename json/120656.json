  "content": "Hi commuters of Typophile,\n\nI am a bit of a perfectionist and I also happen to have a rather extensive font library. I'm using Windows 7 which has outright diabolical font previewing features.\n\nIdeally, I wish to view body text in a variety of different typefaces without compiling LaTeX about a thousand times (not an exaggerated number).\n\nI was hoping somebody could recommend me something to preview fonts.\n\nCurrently I went through a number of existing sites and software:\n\n- wordmark.it (web/JS based viewer)  \n- FontViewOK (lightweight font viewer)  \n- Fast Font Preview (software - looks better, still lacks functionality)  \n- STC font browser (so far the best I've seen)\n\nThe problem I have with the above solutions is that I they all recognise different parts of my library, possibly because I use both OpenType as well as TrueType fonts (or perhaps because my JavaScript is somehow only halfway working). Regardless, solutions like these won't work.\n\nThe only font browser that correctly showed my entire font library was STC font browser. However, I'm looking for something more practical. Somebody who really goes through all the mess of selecting a font from a billion different fonts, will naturally want to e.g. sort fonts by for instance weight, size, or perhaps just by a name (filtering with the keyword \"Titling\" in my fonts library nicely seperates the real pretty fonts from those inferior, gosh I love small caps).\n\nI'll be happy to hear your remarks and suggestions. Thanks.\n\n",
