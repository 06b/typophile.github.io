Make sure you have the kerning classes you require correctly added to the Classes Pallet. The kern values for your exceptions should now turn red in the kern listing.\n\nNow click the top of the kern listing on the header that says 'Value'. This will sort the listing and force all the red exceptions to the end of the listing. Go to the end of the listing and start deleting them.\n\nIt is a bit infuriating that you can only select one entry at a time to delete which means if you have more than just a couple of hundred - it will take a long time to delete them all.\n\nHope this helps  \nMalcolm\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Malcom,\n\nI was looking for some method less manual. Yeap, I finally did that, but it is a pain not to have a way to reset class members if someone has been messing around with them.  \nIf you set them to zero they continue ignoring changes in the leading pair. After setting all of them to zero I cleaned the kerning erasing all pairs with a value under one. In that way they work again with the class.\n\n"
