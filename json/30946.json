You’re new here and asking a lot of extremely basic questions (which seems epidemic these days) some of which are either repetitive (to us) or - no offense - not very interesting. While most people here are happy to help, you will find the info you need regarding type styles in a book like Bringhurst. It’s a worthy investment.\n\nYou will also find - if you read the thread Jason suggested - that there isn’t always a lot of consensus in the design community about even such basic matters as em and en dash usage.\n\n"

You could also try to see if these books are at your local library, if you can’t buy any books right now.\n\nMay I also suggest _The Chicago Manual of Style_? There is a section on punctuation which covers dashes. But as stated above, there is not always consensus on these matters, so no one manual may have the “right” answer. It is a good idea to check out more than one book.\n\n"
