I have just ‘blacked out' [100types](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016145051/http:/www.100types.com/) in protest over the coming legislation here – the ‘draconian’ s92A Copyright Amendment Act. If you know or deal with any New Zealanders online (_especially_ the creative ones), remind them to sign the petition at [The Creative Freedom Foundation](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016145051/http:/www.creativefreedom.org.nz/) and write to their MPs this week.\n\nFor evil to triumph, good men and women need do nothing\\* – but if guilt upon accusation and the subsequent summary disconnection of one's online activities bothers you in any way – join the protest.\n\n\\*misattributed to Edmund Burke, apparently.\n\n[Edit] just in at midnight our time... _\"The Creative Freedom Foundation are celebrating tonight after National's announcement this afternoon that Section 92A will be scrapped, and that they will work towards finding an alternative.\"_\n\nNormal service has been resumed; please do not adjust your set.\n\n",
