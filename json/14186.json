We have a name and domain registered (which can not disclose at this stage as we still have trademarking and legal issues pending) The name has dual meaning, one which implies that designers and creatives are almost a species unto themselves.As I mentioned before, I want to design marketing materials and an advertising campaign around this theme, so I need to do a bit of research to discover what the most common perceptions are with regards to designers/creatives- aesthetics, dress code (or lack there of), body language, interaction, sleep patterns, attitude toward life, politics, clients, the law, etc...  \nI realize this can be an endless list, but it will of course be narrowed down to the stereotypes that are most commonly percieved by the public at large.  \nI would expect this research to get off in some crazy directions. I expect the final expressions will be full of humor.\n\nDesigners Feel: Superior, Egotistic, Passionate, hate when less creative folks get paid more then themselves, etc...\n\nDesigners Desire: Sexual partner to position themselves as letterforms during intercourse-like Eastern Indian's have The Karma Sutra, etc..\n\nDesigners Wear: black turtlenecks, have cool glasses, have tattoos of letterforms instead of names of loved ones....\n\nDesigner Think:\n\n",

I don't understand the need for the hair color, clothing preference, stereotypes. When I get a client brief suggesting that middle-aged moms will be the target user I don't ask what color their hair is (unless it's related to the product!) or what they eat for breakfast (unless it's relevant!). I ask broader questions like how they shop, what activities occupy their free time, how they get their information, what is their income level. Do they make decisions for others. Et cetera.\n\nI'd be more interested in the deeper stereotypes about designers. For example(s):\n\nWhy do designers put celebrity designers on pedestals believing they can do no wrong? (Maybe we don't. I can think of plenty of examples where celebrities work is heartily critiqued, just not by any major design organizations.)\n\nWhy do designers (who presumably try to help others change) have a difficult time with change themselves? (We're riding a bandwagon or two like most people we criticize.)\n\nWhy do most designers seem to lean leftward in their politics? (Do they really think politically or do they just want to question the status quo because it's hip or because it's what \"good\" liberals have done since the sexual revolution?)\n\nWhen asked why designers want to succeed in design, why is the answer often \"fame\"?

The latter is usually quite diffuse, because:  \na. members know their own groups quite well and have a sophisticated, many-facetted view of that group  \nb. people are almost never member of one and only one social category. So they're not often going to think of themselves solely as stereotypical members of said social category, because in the image of oneselve, other categories \"interfere\" and add to the self-image  \nc. not only the image of a social category that one is a member of is diffuse, and gets more blurry around the edges, so is the actual category itself (perhaps with the exception of male-female, and even then...)  \nd. all of the above.\n\nThen, on the other hand, there's the social stereotype which is often very shallow, cliché, etcetera. The social stereotype is well known to practically all members of the culture in which the stereotyped group lives, and because of that, and all the stuff I mentioned above, it's better to ask non-group members about the stereotype than group members.\n\nFinal remark: stereotyping in marketing campaigns often leads to the target (stereotyped) group being hurt, or dismissing the campaign as being shallow. I wish you much subtlety and humour, and I'm curious about the result ;-)\n\n"

There is really a big difference between graphic designers and typographers (mostly found on this site).\n\nI'm a Dutch graphic designer and typographer, so I can't really judge about the mentality in America. I would say here in Holland we have two kinds of designers; the ones that want to be in the foreground, and the ones that just love what they do and don't need to be in the foreground.  \nThe ones that want to be in the foreground dress 'different', need their own little personality to be most shiny, feel that they are the middle point of any party and know everything better just because they are a designer. I don't know many of them personally, I just see them from the outside. So perhaps I'm also wrong with my judgement. :-)  \nThe other group is not that unnormal from most people. Perhaps clothing wise you would not directly identify them as a designer. But if you look carefully the magic is in the details. That pants are just a bit more special, those glasses just have a different shape and his/her voice is just a bit more loud.\n\nI don't feel offended at all by the earlier comments. I think your not that far off if you describe my first group of designers.

Like most designers, I have labored in anonymity for my entire career. I feel I have done some very good work as well as some in the more odoriferous category. Like most designers, I have my opinions about the assorted \"Rock Stars\" in our field--some I hold in great esteem simply because I admire their work. There are other \"Rocky-horror Stars\" whom I perceive as quite ordinary in their work and I say so if the subject arises. I don't feel it appropriate to name names here and begin a \"Sucks / Doesn't Suck\" list. I think what we see (and what starts stereotypes) is that the most vociferous (read obnoxious) boot lickers in our profession ooze praise with such a phony veneer that we remember those people above all the many others who just go about their business. In a crowded subway car, we remember the guy who hasn't had a shower in a month, not the rest of the people along for the ride. We really don't \"know\" what designers as a group feel. We only have heard opinions stated by others. We can create self-fulfilling prophesies by only recognizing designers who fit the narrow stereotype and ignoring those who don't.

They will champion them at all costs... Very detail-oriented; \"I wonder what type of wood grain is on that workstation desktop?\"... Specifics are everything to them: the visual look of gloss inks, the tactile feel of certain papers, the correct usage of typography... For most modern designers, their life is married into technology. It's an arranged marriage, but they accept it. Most designers that I know are very technologically literate... The designer stereotypes that I pick up on the most are always the ones on the edge of trendiness: VW/mini driving, coffee smoking, fashionistas. (I'd argue that this is a learned behavior)... Designers love seeing good design work, and will let people know about it, \"Did you see the execution of that commercial!?!\"...\n\nI hope this helps out, just off the top of my head. Cheers. - Aron\n\n"

When people ask what I do and I answer \"Graphic Design,\" I get a confused look and the reply, \"...and what exactly is that?\"  \nBefore we become stereotyped by the media, we need to be on their radar.

I just as soon stay off the radar. I wouldn't want to be \"racially profiled\" and get falsely arrested for overusing swash characters.\n\n------------------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, and I'm lovin' it... sort of!\n\n"
