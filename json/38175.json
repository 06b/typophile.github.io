The format I uses windows linebreaks and Unicode 8 no BOM. I could have used just Unicode 8 or Unicode 16, or Unicode 16, No BOM, or Unicode 16 Little Endian, or Unicode 16 Little Endian, No BOM.\n\nAny idea what line break type is going to be most compatible - and perhaps more importantly what Unicode encoding is best & why?\n\n\\* The thread is here if you want to use the file or do a technical check:\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/31399](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111122150/http:/typophile.com/node/31399 \"http://typophile.com/node/31399\")\n\nIt is also here in v1.2:\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Languages at a glance.v1.2.txt](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111122150/http:/typophile.com/files/Languages%20at%20a%20glance.v1.2_0.txt) | 49 KB |\n| [Languages at a glance.v1.2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111122150/http:/typophile.com/files/Languages%20at%20a%20glance.v1.2_0.pdf) | 107.82 KB |\n\n",

Changing the preferences to ‘Open files using UTF-8‘ helps.\n- Similar with Safari. _ø_ = _Ã¸_ Switching from ‘Standard’ to ‘Unicode (UTF-8)’ helps\n- My favourite text editor, [skEdit](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111122150/http:/www.skti.org/skEdit_features.php), gets it right in the first place. Its preferences say ‘Open files with UTF-8’\n\nHope that is of use for somebody.\n\n"

This was very helpful!\n\nI will fix some errors that have come to light and re-post v1.1 in 3 formats: TXT RTF & PDF.\n\nBy the way; TextEdit can be made to use 'Unicode UTF-8' also. But you have to make a change in the preferences.\n\nThe other thing which I neglected to say and may be useful to know is that to test for Lingala ( one of the languages ) you must have extended Latin -B support in the font being tested. I would like to add more languages like this over time. Maybe then I can group them by Latin, Latin A & Latin B.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n"
