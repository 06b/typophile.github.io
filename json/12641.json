  "content": "I see that some people in this forum use Corel Draw for generating fonts (Mr. Twardoch, for example). I am a Corel user since version 3 and I find it to be THE tool for many graphic needs. I used it in conjuction with Fontographer to generate my fonts. I want to know if there are some specific suggestions for exporting EPS from Corel into FontLab in order to avoid any grievances such as odd sizes or corrupt data. With Fontographer, EPS would grow or shrink in order to fit in the type cells, which would produce periods as big as majuscules. Are there any known issues to deal with using FL?\n\nI am using version 12 on XP.\n\n",

That used to be a drag with Fontographer. I generate the font directly from Corel normally and then open the font in the font editor, but perhaps there's been an improvement with Fontlab. Or hasn't it?\n\n"
