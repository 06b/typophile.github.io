  "content": "A few times over the past year I have sent emails to The New York Times to inform them of an improper apostrophe that appears in the subscription information alongside the daily crossword. You’ll find it in the word “Today’s” in the following:\n\nAnnual subsriptions: Today’s puzzle and more than 2,000  \npast puzzles, nytimes.com/crosswords ($34.95 a year)\n\nRegarding this I have two questions:\n\n1. How can we get this fixed? It’s driving me nuts. My three or four emails to The New York Times and to its public advocate went unanswered.\n\n2. How much of an issue should this generally be? The vertical mark is used constantly in lieu of the “smart” curling apostrophe. I’ve been educated and appreciate the curling apostrophe. Tick marks are eyesores but it seems silly sometimes to make such a fuss about a miniscule detail in typography - seems to over-emphasize the grammatical aspect of an otherwise complex art.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n [‹ Antenna: Cyrus...I think I love you, man](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120073306/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30447 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typographic magazines: Finding back-issues ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120073306/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30124 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But I think that as time goes by, unless the typographer’s quotes and apostrophes replace tick marks on keyboards, we will see a shift to tick marks used everywhere when young designers who either don’t know or don’t care start taking over.\n\n"

And Apple could have added them - the fact they didn’t casts doubts on Jobs typographic credentials, no?\n\n<cite><br>\n“Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer was beautifully hand-calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating. </cite>\n\nNone of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me, and we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts, and since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them.”\n\n... but you know, key caps were expensive back then, so although it was the first computer with beautiful typography, we put the true quotes and ligs on some obscure shift state of the other random characters - sorry. ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "I have a couple of curmudgeonly comments to mutter into my grey beard.\n\nFirst, it is a fact of life that this crappy unisex tick mark has crept into our lives everywhere. Envision, please, a shiny brass sign in a hotel lobby, announcing the presence of a restaurant called Maude’s: it’s nicely buffed by the staff every week, and has engraved letters filled with scarlet enamel. The word is set in Mistral, _letterspaced_ (which means the joins don’t line up), and the apostrophe is the dreaded vertical tick. We’ve all seen it . . .\n\nThat doesn’t mean we should not take every opportunity to _teach_ people the difference. Many times they are grateful for it. I would say more often they are grateful than the times when they look at me as if I’m from Mars.\n\nWhat I lament the most about the loss of the true double and single quotes is that it represents a loss of utility in addition to lost style. In complex dialogue set with those traditional quotes, you have a reasonable idea of what’s going in. If you lose them to unisex tick marks, then there is no indication of polarity (if that’s a fair term to use). It makes the parsing of the story much more difficult! So the traditional quotes actually serve a genuine orientational purpose, a useful function.\n\nAs for the circumflex mentioned in an earlier post: I agree that it and the tilde are not much used in English typography! However, this calls to mind a very discouraging story from France several decades ago. The French tax authority bought new software for their mainframe computers, some monster new souped-up program from a developer in Houston or Dallas, who’d never even seen a circumflex. Suddenly, tens of thousands of people had their names altered. Families that had been spelling their surnames as Forêt suddenly became Foret, which, let’s face it, ain’t exactly the same thing. A sad outcome, especially because it didn’t _have_ to be that way. One culture not appreciating the subtleties of another.\n\nI take every chance I get to tell people about real apostrophes and quote marks and I explain how to make them (and, _par contre,_ I point out how vigilant they should be that their inch and foot marks in dimensions don’t get interpreted by design software as curly quotes). Show them the color of true small caps and they’ll immediately see the difference between them and machine-generated small caps. I bet a lot of you do the same thing.\n\nWe are the bridge people, as Steve Harvard used to say. We know the difference and it is VITAL that we pass on the values from the old world to as many people as we can, even as the rest of the world sinks into a morass. It’s still worth doing, in my view. Spread the word, one person at a time.\n\n"

I think we should celebrate our roles as guardians of visual language. This is language after all — the magic marks of Beatrice Warde — and if we’re going to take such pains over the shapes of serifs and the design of letters then we shoud take responsibility for how visual language is used.\n\n"
