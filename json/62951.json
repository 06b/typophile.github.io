Here is one spread, a proposed layout with my own text. I'd like a little feedback on:\n\na) form\n\nb) content\n\nThe typefaces are Scala and Scala Sans. Body is set 9/12 x 14 on the verso page and 9/12 x 21.6 on the recto page. Oh, and the center vertical represents the spine.\n\n[CLICK TO DOWNLOAD PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185335/http:/www.evanmade.com/storage/Zapf_Layout.pdf)\n\nThanks!\n\nEvan\n\n[www.evanmade.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185335/http:/evanmade.com/)\n\n",

      "content": "The spread looks very good to me. But I'd check the text horizontal alignment bewteen the colums (eg: first and second column on the right page in the Zapf\\_Layout2.pdf: the text in the \"In the twilight of his life\" paragraph doesn't align with the text in the first column). This is the only real problem I see; moreover, I'd also increase the spacing bewtween the last paragraph and the footnotes (why letters instead of numbers?, anyway), with a thinner or gray line. In the end, I would also try to not hyphen the text. But as I said, it really looks like a good typograhycal piece.\n\n"
