Sometimes ’Antique’ will also work.\n\nThere is one typeface there (FLEURET, etc) that resembles Copperplate Gothic. [HF Exposition](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821145321/http:/www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Exposition&producttype=TYP&pricemodel=RM%2CRF) is also roughly this vintage in terms of style\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
