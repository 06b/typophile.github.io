If you license the OpenType Com fonts (see [http://www.linotype.com/12641/univers55roman-font.html#format](http://web.archive.org/web/20130707113320/http:/www.linotype.com/12641/univers55roman-font.html#format \"http://www.linotype.com/12641/univers55roman-font.html#format\")), or the Pro fonts, you get both the Central European and the Western European glyph coverage! But if you need a non-OpenType font, you have to pick one or the other :(\n\nMy guess is that most people use OpenType now anyway. But I could be wrong!\n\n"
