It may be the white on blue on my laptop monitor, but the Regular is not nearly as crisp... many features are lost, particularly in the numerals ('2', f'rinstance, has no counter to speak of).\n\nI LOVE the Stencil W. what a nice solution to a cumbersome char.\n\ngeo.\n\n"

      "content": "I actually started off with the stencil, but halfway through the alphabet decided to make a regular version as well. It's not a \"good\" stencil (the @ & the % still have gaps that would get lost if stencilled), but I was just aiming for the stencil effect. The W was really bad at first (much too wide compared to the rest), but I'm quite pleased with the second version.  \nI might try to make some alternate letters to mix it up a bit more.\n\n"
