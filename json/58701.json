Plus the D’s are identical... even tho they are different sizes.\n\nBut ya know, I could be wrong : )  \nMichael\n\n"

But back to the font, it doesn’t really matter if it’s written or a font because it’s not that good. It’s really inconsistent in spacing, kerning, connection-strokes and countershapes. But I do think it’s a font, a writer that spends time learning this should know the basics that would not result in this.\n\n"
