I'm getting an error.\n\nI exported an InDesign Tagged Text, opened in BBEdit, did a GREP pattern Find/Replace, changing nothing else, and when I try to import it, this error appears.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414193429im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hatchxml_6678.png)\n\nEither this works, or I have to manually insert tabs at the beginning of almost 300 pages worth of numbered lists.\n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: IT is not xml, my bad, it's InDesign Tagged Text.\n\n",

Now I use a homegrown and probably more complicated workflow: XML with a simple DTD \\> XSLT \\> LaTeX. Takes more time to convert things, but at least I am now able to use it the way I want…\n\nBack to topic: What exactly did you change in BBEdit? Might the cause of your problem also be an encoding issue or error in your grep replace pattern?\n\n"
