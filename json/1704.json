This is not my native language.   \n   \nI would just wish to know if anyone ever noticed a problem in FreeHand MX and 10 (OS X)... or is it me?   \n   \nIn FreeHand MX and 10 (OS X):   \nType an \"O\" and then use the menu \"Text : Convert to Paths\". I see a whole bunch of segments. Way too much.   \n   \nDo the same in Illustrator 10 and below:   \nNo problems.   \n   \nThank you for your input :-)   \n   \nYves Malouin\n\n",
