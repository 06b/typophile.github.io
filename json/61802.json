  "content": "So I really want to use neutraface for a corporate identity—from logo through to brochure copy.\n\nHowever, the uppercase E really bothers me. It’s too modern. I think the face would be perfect if it weren’t for that one character, which is used in typesetting the company’s name.\n\nOn the House Industries website they show the large N from neutraface—but the text below it—that E is different, and I can’t seem to find an alternate version in the Try Font feature..\n\nIs that neutraface or not? A different cut of Futura than what I have? (the R in that looks much better than mine).\n\nWhat is that?\n\n[http://www.houseind.com/include/getimage.php?id=8002](http://web.archive.org/web/20090924021413/http:/www.houseind.com/include/getimage.php?id=8002 \"http://www.houseind.com/include/getimage.php?id=8002\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [getimage.php\\_.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090924021413/http:/typophile.com/files/getimage.php__0.gif) | 2.84 KB |\n\n",
