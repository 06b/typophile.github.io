  "content": "I’m using FontForge version 20080203 and adding a single glyph to Futura Book (Bitstream version, which has no editable embedding restrictions), but upon TTF generation, I can no longer embed the font in a PDF.\n\nTwo questions: 1) where are the embedding/editable embedding flags set in FontForge, and 2) how can I find out if this is against Bitstream’s EULA? I’m not selling or distributing the font, it’s merely to be able to use a specific bullet in the same form field as Futura Book.\n\n [‹ Rounded corners script](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007165203/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42124 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [combining accents unicode question ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007165203/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42374 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
