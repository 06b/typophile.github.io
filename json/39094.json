  "content": "I am currently working on a kinetic identity for a non profit org in my vis com class and I have chosen ’flint club’.  \n This organization basically promotes prosperity and connecting people in the downtown flint/michigan area by hosting various events.\n\nThe logo itself depicts an arche. There are seven arches that had been erected in the early 1900s that covered different streets in the downtown area that also lit the roads at night. They are iconic and i have decided to exploit them in the logo.\n\nI almost want to approach this logo in a more tangible form to better relate to the kinetic identiy system, some type of material i can use to enforce the idea of the hard working/blue collar, grounded city. I just cant think of anything, help? comments?\n\nmany thanks!\n\n- JR\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 13.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202140107/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2013_0.png) | 21.81 KB |\n\n [‹ a8 music](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202140107/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38966 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Yep...another design studio logo in need of critique ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202140107/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39185 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I’m not sure what you mean by “kinetic identity system”. What you’re showing is pretty static and singular. Do you intend multiple versions? Subbrands that vary through color or other relationship?\n\nWhat you’ve shown so far are only 2 very simple iterations. If I were your teacher, I’d expect to see considerably more work. Now, maybe you’ve done that and are only showing us your most promising directions. If that’s the case, then you need to push yourself harder. I get the concept of the arches, but I don’t see a unique expression that relates to Flint. Maybe that’s why you’re looking for something more tangible, like materials, to bring into the system. That’s a fine idea, but you’ve got to nail down the graphic expression first. Explore what can make this identity unique to Flint and you’ll be a bit closer to a better logo.\n\n"

      "content": "Jonsel; thank you much for your input, great advice. I have done a considerable amount of work and have narrowed it down to this last look i’ve shown you all, however I agree with you that I do need to nail down a better graphical expression that relates uniquley to Flint. You almost seem familiar with flint or the idea of a working class/ motor type city, have any inclination of materials or graphic language i could use for the logo and supporting graphics? I would much appreciate your tips advice on that.\n\nCuttlefish; thank you as well for your advice. Im with you too, I feel its very institutional(ish), which is fine, but not the direction I would like to go. I want something that is now, but has somre feel of footing and has lasting appeal.\n\nThank you both and I hope to get even more advice from you both on direction, materials i can look into, and designs, heck, even links resources i can check into.\n\nThanks again both of you and i look forward to hearing back from you both. By the way hit me up in ichat: missmyext\n\nthanks,\n\njoe\n\n"
