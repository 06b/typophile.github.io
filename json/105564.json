Middleton in 1934.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225200234im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Eden_6668.jpg)\n  \nSince writing this I found that the Spandau Ballet Logo was discussed four years ago. The typophiles of the day also suggested Eden as a possible source.

The images are from the CD cover for Spandau Ballet's album, Journey's to Glory, released in 1981 on the Chrysalis label, with the cover printed in West Germany.  \nThe lettering also appears on Spandau Ballet's \"The Freeze.\"  \nSo whoever created the CD cover probably also created the lettering. Photo-lettering could have ensured consistency. I suspect this was not a full font.  \nDon\n\n"
