Quite   \na different interpretation than Giampa's, and even more   \ndifferent than Jonathan's image sample.   \n   \nIs it just me, or is this a mishmash of eras/styles? That   \nleading 'T', to my inexpert eye, really looks out of place.   \n   \nI'll be interested to see Jonathan's reply to give context.\n\n"

      "content": "I can give context. This is a sign that first went up outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London around 6 years ago (before that they had no signs outside). The font basically matches (I cannot promise exactly) the standard typography they use (from time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary) for signage inside the building. It probably goes back a long way, certainly to hand-painted signs and so on. Presumably some technological solution has now been found, and the basic style remains in use for signage in the RCJ.   \n   \nI have never seen it printed. When English lawyers used ye olde type on printed documents they generally used (and use, though it is now rather rare) something that looks like Monotype Old English Text or Engravers Old English.\n\n"
