He came to Canada afterwards where he started a family. He loved to fish and read history books.\n\nI was thinking of using a script typeface for headings and a serif for the body. Any suggestions of typefaces that may relate to Polish roots or can tell a similar story to the information provided would be greatly appreciated.\n\nFor more ideas, I attached his family coat of arms.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [coat\\_of\\_arms.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080926191503/http:/typophile.com/files/coat_of_arms.jpg) | 122.76 KB |\n\n [‹ hand drawn script (not BRUSH SCRIPT!!)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080926191503/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40193 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [How to Rasterize an image? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080926191503/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40230 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

And ITC Bodoni Twelve if you want a more mid-19th-century look.\n\n"

I am leaning more towards Spectrum but have a hard time trying to find a complementary typeface in a script face. Clairvaux was a possibility for chapter headings and the title page but it doesn’t seem to look appropriate. I may just end up choosing a sans serif to be safe.\n\nAny more help would be great… either way I am sure I will be okay choosing.\n\nThanks again\n\n"

      "content": "Spectrum does indeed have oldstyle figures and I think it’s more elegant than Janson. I have always found Janson clunky, and the italics are kinda ugly.\n\nSabon is very nice, as are Columbus and Fournier.\n\nYou never get consensus here, go with your instinct.\n\n"

      "content": "Monotype Spectrum is too delicate and wimpy for snappy use below 11pt, and, crucially, it lacks default-loaded oldstyle figures; the roman ones are segregated in expert fonts, in the tedious old way. OpenType Janson much, much better. What about Linotype Sabon with oldstyle figures? And be sure to look at Joshua Darden’s Corundum, his re-think of Fournier.\n\n"
