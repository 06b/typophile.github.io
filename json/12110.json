[SOTA](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040247/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/SOTA) partners with local and international organizations to produce a low-cost event featuring some of the brightest names in type, design, and the related disciplines. TypeCon offers a warm and inviting atmosphere where students and novices can mingle comfortably with seasoned professionals.\n\nTypeCon allows type lovers from all walks of life to get together — to listen, to learn, to teach, to network, and to take renewed inspiration into their own work.\n\nTypeCon has been held in North American cities to date, but draws a growing number of speakers, exhibitors, and attendees from outside North America.\n\nThe growing [flickr TypeCon pool](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040247/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/85628044@N00/pool/) documents not only the event but local venue signage and other lettering as well.\n\n**Upcoming:**\n\nTypeCon2014 — Washington, DC\n\n**Past Conferences:**\n\nTypeCon2013: Portl& — _Portland, Oregon_  \nTypeCon2012: MKE Shift — _Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  \nTypeCon2011: Surge — _New Orleans, Louisiana_  \nTypeCon2010: Babel — _Los Angeles, California_  \nTypeCon2009: Rhythm — _Atlanta, Georgia_  \nTypeCon2008: Punkt — _Buffalo, New York_  \nTypeCon2007: Letter Space — _Seattle, Washington_  \nTypeCon2006: The Boston T Party — _Boston, Massachusetts_  \nTypeCon2005: Alphabet City — _New York, New York_  \nTypeCon2004: Type High — _San Francisco, California_  \nTypeCon2003: Counter Culture — _Minneapolis, Minnesota_  \nTypeCon2002: The Medium and the Message — _Toronto, Ontario_  \nTypeCon2001: r/evolution — _Rochester, New York_  \nTypeCon2000: _Westborough, Massachusetts_  \nTypeCon1998: _Westborough, Massachusetts_\n\n**Conference Site:**\n\n[www.typecon.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423040247/http:/www.typecon.com/ \"www.typecon.com\")\n\n",
