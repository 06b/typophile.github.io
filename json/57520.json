  "content": "I am happy to introduce a highly versatile multi width type family called Tanger Serif by Jarno Lukkarila Type Foundry. After three years of preparation it feels great to make it public!\n\nTanger Serif is inspired by fine Transitionals and hard working news paper fonts from the 19th century. It shares their strong and straightforward appearance in refreshed and up-to-date form. Tanger Serif comes in three widths each containing five weights in both roman and italic.\n\nFonts include many Open Type features (including small caps and old style figures) which allow close typographic detailing. Wide character sets guarantee extensive language support.\n\nFind more about Tanger Serif at our website  \n [www.jarnolukkarila.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013181854/http:/www.jarnolukkarila.com/ \"www.jarnolukkarila.com\")\n\nIf you’d like to receive a pdf specimen, please mail us to [support@jarnolukkarila.com](mailto:support@jarnolukkarila.com)\n\nBest Regards,  \nJarno Lukkarila\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013181854im_/http:/typophile.com/files/JLTF_Tanger_Serif_preview_6377.jpg)\n\n",
