  "content": "Hi, i need some help on this logo im doing for a Fitness club named Fit yourmind  \nThe moto ive been sticking to is either the idea of fitting into a certain box which is “yourmind”,  \nin other words, the ideia of working your body.  \nThe other concept, the one used on both the 1st and the 2nd logo is the “mold” idea, stretching  \nyour body applying movement to it in order to accomplish that same goal.\n\nThe Type has a light and condensed feel, and i think it fits ok into the fitness whole idea.\n\nAbout the color, i’m gonna apply some light blue on both the logo and the word Fit.  \nAnyway, they’r still in gray scale.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [fiturmindnet.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808150230/http:/typophile.com/files/fiturmindnet.jpg) | 50.25 KB |\n\n [‹ filmaker logo, need opinions!!!](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808150230/http:/typophile.com/node/18047 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [magazine masthead ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808150230/http:/typophile.com/node/18404 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I think it would be fair to say that at this stage your VI is heading in a very ’corporate’ direction. Is this something that you are seeking?\n\nYou have some spacing issues which could be better resolved. The graphic in the first two ideations is floating and unattached to the type - there is a lack of unity forming here. Perhaps the type would fit better if the first line ’fityourmind’ almost slotted into the concave side of the graphic. The spacing of ’fit’ compared to ’yourmind’ is also somewhat uneasy due to its spacing. I would remove the space after the word ’fit’.\n\nThe first option has somewhat more dynamics and horizontal movement making it feel slightly more energetic for a fitness trainer.\n\nI don’t feel that the third option is working particularly well. It feels very static, and spatially the ’colour’ of the negative and positive is unresolved.\n\nI hope this feedback has not been too negative and that my thoughts are of assistance. Good luck.\n\n-nic\n\n"

I’m not seeing that yet. And I agree about the type not working together with the shape. For the words “fit” and “mind,” e.g., you might pick up in subtle ways on the lines or curves of the shape thingie.\n\n"

      "content": "You need to review the concept of the name itself. It makes no sense, its like an inside joke. The shapes make no sense for a retail audience and the colors are dead. Try this, make Personal Training Solutions the main focus and make the name small like a subhead. That way the average consumer will know what the business is about and then the name. This would also allow you to make a mark that emphsises “personal”\n\n"
