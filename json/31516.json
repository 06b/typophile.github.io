I don’t belong to any “chat” groups, I’m not a computer nerd — but I just had an experience I felt I had to share with someone. And who knows — this could happen to you.\n\nI belong to a club that has had a website since 2002. A year ago, the webmaster changed server hosts, and the new host told them it was transferring the site name as well. Well, the original register wanted their money - and the new host never asked….\n\nTo make a long story short, there was a screw up as to who we were to give money to to keep the site going.\n\nOn February 15th - a company in Australia bought the name from register.com\n\nIt’s a club’s site - no interest to anyone outside of the 200 to 300 people who visit is a year.\n\nI am now finding out this has become a common practice - and that sites are stolen like this all the time. The US government cannot do anything about it - because it is now under the jurisdiction of the Australian government.\n\nIf the club wants it back - it has to pay the new owner for it.\n\nDon’t let this happen to you… I cannot believe there are folks that stoop that low….\n\n",
