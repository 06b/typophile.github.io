But, then there's the occasional slab face that bucks the trend, and has ascenders taller than caps.\n\n",

There are other ways to do this, and also it's a choice how much the designer wants to make the caps and lower case similar in color or different.\n\n"

Reducing the size of the uppercase can help balance a word better. This gets less pronounced in large sizes.
