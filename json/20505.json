But I think the shops will stay with the redirecting-tool because of the better comfort for customers when they want to buy a font (at the right, local, shop). It makes sense, for sure, but it is some times annoying for linking to a typeface. And, yes, sometimes it works with the “double-click-trick” to fool the redirect-tool.  \nHave a nice day, too.\n\n"
