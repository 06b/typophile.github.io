  "content": "Hi,\n\nI need help to identify the font used in the PIN-UP Magazine Issue 6. It is a grotesque font. The form-principle is similar to Helvetica, Akzidenz. But it has some special characteristics, like the lowercase a, or the uppercase R. Maybe its custom made?\n\nDoes anybody know this font?\n\nNitzki\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013600im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PIN_UP__6524.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013600im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PIN_UP_0001_5384.jpg)\n\n",
