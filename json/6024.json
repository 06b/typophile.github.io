There are some similar fonts issued by various foundries. I have collected roughly 500 fonts of this hand printed style (including the ClickArt fonts) in [Part 11](http://web.archive.org/web/20110617150928/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html) of my Script Font ID Guide, but you should realize that this font style can be easily and cheaply created. There are more freeware and one-of-a-kind handprinted fonts than you can start to hunt through, so my advice is usually just find something similar, and go with that.\n\n"
