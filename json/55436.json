Or even have exclusive rights, in the case of FontFonts (FF). :)\n\nI think it will most definitely also depend on what kind of printed matter. If it is an article in a magazine about a typeface, I can't see why anyone would protest if you print a PDF specimen with the article. But if you print it on a poster and sell the poster, I could see a problem. So the question is; what kind of printed matter / publication is it?\n\nIn all other cases you should contact the designer / distributor. If you're meaning to make money off it, I think it's probably safe to say it's not allowed in most cases.\n\n"
