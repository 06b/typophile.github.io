It's a \"business school\" in the sense that preparing kids for the real world is their main goal.\n\nDo you have any font to suggest for a nice coupling with Optima Regular (school's corporate font)?\n\nthanks\n\n",

I don't know if anyone else feels the same way. I would try and steer them towards something more neutral, but still contemporary. There are a lot of typefaces out there that could work if they're open to something else. If they have to stick with it, I would look at a sans that works, and keep it to a minimum. Maybe Avenir, Gotham, Frutiger?\n\n"

I was actually going for Bliss. I'll post some design in a later stage so you'll see the results!\n\nThanks again.\n\ntezzu\n\n"
