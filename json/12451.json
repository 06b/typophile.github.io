Particularily when I'm going for the clean-modern-elegant look. Do you have any suggestions for other fonts that would fit the bill?\n\nCheers!\n\nChad Brewer\n\n",

      "content": "Chad,\n\nFutura is a very accommodating typeface for that clean-modern look however I find myself using Officina or Frutiger often too. The trick I find is to get 2 typefaces that are a nice complement of each other and go from there. I know it is bad to limit yourself to 2 and by no means is that what I am saying, but for somebody in school it is a very good thing to see what the limitations of said face are.\n\nMy 2 during school were Futura Family (regular & condensed) and Minion Pro, a very nice face however used quite often can create the same drone feeling that Times has created for itself.\n\nGood Luck,\n\n**Matthew Potter,**  \n<cite>Business Analyst, Electronic Art Specialist<br>\nGroupe Pages Jaune / Yellow Pages Group<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:matthew.potter@ypg.com\">matthew.potter@ypg.com</a><br>\n——————————<br>\nBusiness Manager, Partner<br>\nPg1 - Design &amp; Consulting<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:matthew@pg1.ca\">matthew@pg1.ca</a><br>\n——————————<br>\nMember of Executives<br>\nType Club of Toronto</cite>\n\n"

[Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Avenir) is a typeface based on [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Futura) that [Adrian Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Adrian%20Frutiger) designed in 1988. He had never been bappy with the cold, modern appearance of Futura, so he humanized it. In 2003, he and [Akira Kobayashi](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Akira%20Kobayashi) redrew Avenir, creating Avenir Next, which has better distribution of weight across the family, small caps, old style figures, and condensed styles. No [true italics](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/true%20italics), though. I don't think that Frutiger was ever a fan of those.\n\nHere is the [URL to Avenir Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html), and here is one to the old [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.linotype.com/72/avenir-family.html).  \n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"

In particular, I reach for [GalaxiePolaris](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/thirstype.com/fonts.php?font=GalaxiePolaris) whenever I need a superbly stylish grotesk.\n\n[Stalemate](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/stalemate.asp) would have been on my list as well if Yves hadn't mentioned it already.\n\n[Vista Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=200) is wonderful too, but beware. Even though designer Xavier Dupré says \"the text weights are loosely spaced\" I was shocked to discover just how loosely spaced they are - so much so that Vista Sans is not, in my view, a realistic choice for extended text at a bookish 9.5 points, for example. Magically, the text weights start to work and really are quite lovely starting at around 11 points - but they still seem better suited to shorter than to longer texts at this size as well.\n\nOne final caveat on Vista: it is a very, very dark typeface. I usually have issues with the fact that many digital fonts are too light for my limited office toolset, but Vista is a little dark even for me. The book weight might be considered a regular in other fonts, the regular a medium, and the medium a bold.\n\nRegardless, I find Dupré's work amazing and am now saving my pennies for his FF Absara Sans, [reportedly](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123227/http:/typographi.com/001000.php) due out from FontShop later this year.\n\n"
