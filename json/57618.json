I can't seem to find it at the moment, but I'm sure someone here can help with that. If you generated it as a Postscript font instead of an OpenType font, then you have limited it to the first 256 characters(the ones with the yellow bands at the top).\n\nHopefully someone else will add some more useful information to this for you.\n\n"
