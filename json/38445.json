But the statement you make is but a subset of “the idea”, dangerously cartooned in my opinion, in a way that can easily lead to brain freeze. The size of everything matters relative to the expected use of a type design for a given tone of voice...the typographic world around you should seem at least locally objective “published” proof...no?\n\n”...might very well be just a bunch of BS...”\n\nYou planning to print anything for this judge? ah kin halp ;-)\n\nCheers!\n\n"

The audience for my thesis work is organizational leaders—the sort of people who would be a lot more receptive to a designer’s anecdotes if they’re backed up by “science.”\n\n<cite>You planning to print anything for this judge? ah kin halp ;-)</cite>\n\nOh, the things I am planning to do for this project… I’ll put up a big post about my thesis work soon, because I need better feedback than the suggestions I got.

The tests were for maximizing legibility for a certain number of words on certain sizes of sign. And the emphasis was on what works at night, with lights shining on the words, which are reflective, with cars speeding toward the signs. And they were comparing existing fonts to specifically proposed new ones. From what I read, their results seem pretty solid for their limited brief.\n\nGeneralizing beyond this to what is readable in text on paper or on screen is problematic, but I don’t think the researchers attempted any such generalization or made any claims about it.\n\nThere are a lot of problems with research in this area, but you can be too cynical too.\n\n"
