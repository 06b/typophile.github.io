  "content": "I want to have a different version for a letter everytime you type the letter.  \nFor example if you type a A and 30 letters later you type a A again then it should be the A.1 version.\n\nA——————A.1—————————A.2——-A.3——————A.4\n\nThe code would be something like:\n\nsub A @all @all @all A’ by A.1;  \nsub A @all @all A’ by A.1;  \nsub A @all A’ by A.1;  \nsub A A’ by A.1;\n\nAnd that for every letter and alt version which makes the code really big.\n\nIs it possible to use a lookup for the @all part?  \nLike this:\n\nsub A’ A’ by A.1;\n\nWhere the lookup is used for:\n\n@all;  \n@all @all;  \n@all @all @all;  \n@all @all @all @all;\n\nSo the lookup can be easy re-used for the B and C etc. (and A.1 A.2 ...)\n\nIs there a more simple way to archive this?  \nI tried some things (with different code) but i moslty end up in:\n\nA/A.1/B.2/A.3/A.4/B.5\n\nwhere i want it to be:  \nA/A.1/B/A.2/A.3/B.1\n\nAlso i can’t get the lookup from the opentype feature file specification to work:\n\n[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic\\_feature\\_file\\_syntax.htm...](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103112016/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#5.f.i \"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic\\_feature\\_file\\_syntax.html#5.f.i\")\n\nI get the error:  \naborting because of errors:  \nsyntax error at “lookup”\n\n",
