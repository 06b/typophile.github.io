The style often includes the spurs sticking out at mid height. Your sample is a logo so it could be modified from its source.  \nIf you would be satisfied with something similar a good place to check for commercial fonts is [MyFonts with tag Tuscan](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014090712/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Atuscan/fonts/).
