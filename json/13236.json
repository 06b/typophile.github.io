      "content": "Hi (from an amateur typographer, but take it as you wish).  \nSo here it goes.\n\nYour font has a **nice horizontal flowing feeling** to it yet you should **improve one or two things** :\n\n- The **lower stem+belly connection on the \"b\" and \"d\"** should get fixed, as in a simplified curve from the base to the stem instead of a complex stem to curve intersection (specially the \"b\"). It would prevent it to be a \"brake\" in the horizontal flow of the line. _On the other hand your font will get \"rounder\"..._\n\n- The other thing is **the horizontal bar on the \"a\", the \"e\" and specially the \"3\"**. There are to many curves. It gives your characters a _blurry look_. Probaly if you eliminate the top or the bottom curve joint of the inner intersection it'll lighten up without loosing the design.\n\nI think you can develop a very nice font if you keep it up. **I specially like the \"z\".**\n\nKeep it up!  \nCheers.\n\nBy the way,\n\n<cite>its still heavy WIP as you see</cite>\n\nwhat's WIP???\n\n"
