  "content": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm designing a poster for an upcoming play which takes place in New York. I came up with something that was an homage to Saul Bass. The director liked it, but he was worried that it looked too old-school since the play is set in modern-day New York.\n\nSo my question - do you have any examples of designs or styles that would convey \"modern-day New York\"?\n\n- Lex\n\n",

But, I can say the thing about New York, from my outsider's perspective, is that it will probably always have old world charm. I mean, think about Woody Allen. He makes movies based on that mystique. No?\n\n"

Among the pay fonts are DF Forge and Battery Park, both from Veer\n\n--deco or moderne fonts like Mostra, Binner Gothic, Romeo, Huxley Vertical, Bernhard Gothic (best from Spiece Graphics), various takes on Johnston, Neutraface, and Burin Sans. Nick Curtis has marvelous deco/moderne faces for little or no money; check them at MyFonts or the Nick Curtis download site listed on our free fonts resource page.\n\n--Donald Trump piss-elegant, like Trajan and related high-society Charlotte York looks\n\n"
