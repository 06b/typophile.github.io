I think PC PostScript fonts work too, but I'm not sure.\n\n2) Windows XP (and consequently most compatible software) can run on Mac hardware, either with Virtual PC on PowerPC models, or with Boot Camp on the newer MacIntel models.\n\nSo, if you have your software all installed on the same machine, you should be allowed to use all your fonts on that machine, even if they are used between multiple operating systems, unless the font's EULA specifically or implicitly excludes this sort of use.\n\n"
