  "content": "I am quite hoping to identify the font from the 1961 poster for \"The Frightened City.\" I am guessing the stencil variety was custom and is not available, however, I would be perfectly content knowing the basic font character set used here or any other information about these characters. I've been searching for a few years for this font, but with no luck. Proxima Nova condensed Black is somewhat close, but not exactly it. The Gs, Cs, and Rs are not right. Thanks much in advance!!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [The Frightened City.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011165329/http:/typophile.com/files/The%20Frightened%20City_0.png) | 245.25 KB |\n\n",
