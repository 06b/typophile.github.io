So I wonder if someone could clarify.\n\n",

      "content": "I do think the regular capitals stand out, but in your defense I do appreciate the difficulty of setting a text that includes words like TiVo and MySpace, and being prose, perhaps there is more wiggle room, except that you say you still used small caps on the TOC - is it because you wanted it to have more formality?  \nAnd back to regular caps standing out, you might even say they are supposed to be that way - they are often brand names and results of marketers who fully intend for them to stand out - a purposeful interruption of the flow.\n\n"
