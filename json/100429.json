  "content": "Hi friends,\n\nI'm developing a script font that relies on Contextual Alternates for the script connections.\n\nAfter I've added a  \n`\n  # Latin\n  script latn;\n    # Dutch\n    language NLD;\n          sub i j by ij; # Dutch ij\n`  \nto the font, the Contextual Alternates feature is not applied anymore when the language in InDesign 7.0.4 is set to Dutch.  \nThe other languages work as expected.  \nThe Contextual Alternates features does not contain any Script/Language tags, only default Script/Language substituations.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this?  \nThank you.\n\n",

So I am well aware of the limitations of keyboards. I also have layouts I made for myself with SIL Ukelele.\n\nOn the other hand, the Canadian French CSA keyboard does not contain the oe ligature(\\*) and, so far as I know, people rely on the spell checker for it and, in my opinion, it does a good job.\n\nWhether the Dutch spell checker is as useful with ij ligatures, I don't know. I just downloaded the OpenOffice nl\\_NL dictionary and it contains more than 9700 entries with the ij ligature. I am not saying that adding an ij character on the keyboard could not be beneficial but I fail to see how it could improve much the final text, whether printed or for the screen.\n\n(\\*) On the mac, you need to type ALT q to get œ.\n\n"

      "content": "IJ/ij was a separate key on Dutch typewriters, and it is only since the advent of computers and hardware based on US models that it has not been readily available for input as a separate character. That doesn't stop some Dutch publishers from routinely replacing all occurences of i+j in Dutch texts with the Unicode ij digraph character. Why do they do this? Because in Dutch orthography this digraph has behaviours in casing, spacing and accentuation that differ from the i and j as independent letters. There are means to apply these behaviours to i+j, but it is much easier to do so with the ij character.\n\n"

With LaTeX, I know how to prevent \"automatic ligatures\". With opentype fonts, is it easy to put a zero width non breaking character between the i and the j? Is there other tools available? With the babel package in LaTeX, I could also switch from Dutch to English for the corresponding word; can that be done in standard text editors so that Fiji would not be written with a ligature?\n\nIn any case, if I use for Dutch the same rules I use for French, if the input file does not comply with the Dutch dictionary, it is simply erroneous, even if the font makes the output look right.\n\n"

Language tagging is pretty standard in text processing these days, because spellchecking, hyphenation etc. all rely on it.\n\nMy Leiden client, Brill, regularly use the Unicode IJ/ij digraph characters, but in the fonts I made for them they also wanted the kind of Dutch-specific ligation proposed in this thread.\n\n"
