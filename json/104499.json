Also some others including [LTC Swing Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828232102/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-swing-bold/). I even noticed it in an old copy of \"From Tenderfoot to King's Scout.\" For a show about creativity, it's disappointing that the designers at American Idol did not try something more original.  \nDon\n\n"
