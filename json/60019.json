  "content": "It appears as though [ambigrams](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820163527/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram) are becoming a popular design exercise. I have noticed a bit of difficulty distinguishing between [ambigrams](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820163527/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram), [palindromes](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820163527/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) and [semordnilaps](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820163527/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome#Semordnilaps) (I think you need to scroll down to see semordnilap). I wonder if it’s possible to design an ambigram/palindrome or an ambigram/semordnilap?\n\n",
