Also, i am not a type expert, but it seems as though you either need to make the P curve at the bottom a little thicker or the R curve a little thinner:   \n   \nhere is what i mean about the moon rotated and the R thinner.   \n   \nI also agree the bottom of the E is too long.

You don't see the moon that way on our hemisphere, do you? Anyway, I think that north-east has most 'universalilty'. (Red Crescent -- the non-christian equivalent to Red Cross has its opening pointing east).   \n   \nI don't see a problem misreading O for C ... having read 'THE' and 'SLEEP' I'm sure noone would go on 'STCRE' ...   \n   \nYou still need to adjust the upper stem/curve joints in P and R.   \n   \nI would prefer a normal leg to R ... considering its position right next to the pun.   \n   \nI agree with those that say the E is too broad ... the more 'dull' the other letters are, the more interesting the moon!   \n   \n--   \nSoren O\n\n"
