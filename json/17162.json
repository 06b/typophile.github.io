      "content": "sorry about that... It will be used primarily in a word mark but I am thinking we will need complimentary text weight faces for standard publication usage as well. If there is a face that will compliment in the publication text, we can use that, but it would be nice to have one face across the board.\n\nI really like Frutiger next, but the lack of weights might be an issue. ITC johnson might work too, thanks guys! I will give them a try. If anyone has any other comments or questions, I would love to hear them.\n\nThanks again!\n\n"
