  "content": "Hi, I'm designing a branding for my school project for a Guy Ritchie film festival. He is the director of the movies like Snatch, RockNRolla, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Revolver, Serlock Holmes. His movies are mostly about the lucky underground criminals of London. I would like to ask which typefaces are going to be appropriate for his style?\n\n",

Overall, I think the brand should be understated because the communication is a showcase of other material, not a showcase of the man. He's the artist behind the work, and perhaps your type choice should reflect his role behind the camera rather than some representative cliche of his films.\n\n"
