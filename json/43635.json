  "content": "Hello  \nI'm trying to find the four typefaces used on this series of Tarkovsky soundtrack CDs released by Toei Music Publishing (Japan) in the mid-1990s.\n\n•&nbsp;The italic used for the film titles – \"Zerkalo\" and \"Stalker\".  \n•&nbsp;The bold condensed grotesk used for \"Andrey Tarkovsky\" (possibly Akzidenz Bold Condensed?)  \n•&nbsp;The glittery number \"4\"  \n•&nbsp;The typewriter font used for the glittery Cyrillic version of \"Tarkovsky\"\n\nI have a couple more images from other CDs in this series if anybody needs extra letters or numbers to work with, but they are a bit more blurry than this one.\n\nI know it's a lot to ask, so thanks in advance.\n\nAndrew\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130412135357im_/http:/typophile.com/files/iz_69_3_orig_3767.jpg)\n\n",

Perhaps Helvetica Black Condensed?  \n [http://www.linotype.com/12573/helveticablackcondensed-font.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130412135357/http:/www.linotype.com/12573/helveticablackcondensed-font.html \"http://www.linotype.com/12573/helveticablackcondensed-font.html\")\n\n"
