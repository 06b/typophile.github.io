  "content": "Is it just me or does Fontlab do a better job with the bold effect when it is a positive integer as opposed to a negative one. i.e. bold effect 10 vs. bold effect -10, could it really be any different, it's applying the same function… I know it's an imperfect science by nature but it seems like I have a lot more work to do if I apply a negative integer to a glyph than a positive… and I'm talking in general with relatively non-complex character forms…\n\n",
