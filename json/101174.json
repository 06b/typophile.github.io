  "content": "Me again,\n\nCould someone please explain to me what is the way to program this Opentype feature? I've been searching for info about this but I cannot seem to find anything conclusive. I've been looking at the way some fonts implement this feature and it seems to differ one from another; some substitute entire classes while other just seem to substitute in a glyph by glyph fashion. What is the way to go?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n",
