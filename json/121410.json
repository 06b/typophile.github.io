When he awoke he forced his eyes open and saw all these little white triangles scattered around.  \nBig idea! Paste triangular serifs on an old style thick and thin font and his job was done! He hoped it would fly with his boss just as well as his folded paper airplanes had done. An so it did. The little white triangles flew until PANAM went bankrupt in the 1990s.  \nDon\n\n"
