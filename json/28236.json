Stanley Hess, in ’On the Modification of Letter Forms’ says that as a general rule, any vertically divided letter tends to have the top half narrowed.\n\nThus the top half of the B and S are generally smaller, the top arm of the E shorter, the top arm of the a shorter, etc. I think the rule is more general. In furniture, the classic ’highboy’ or ’chest on chest’ of drawers has the top half narrowed. Otherwise the top looks ’overweighted’. Similarly often with buildings (not Bauhaus though).\n\nI suspect this optical effect is because the narrowed top in a physical object makes it more stabile. The roman letters, resting on a base line, we view to some extent as objects having weight. Perhaps with scripts, the ’marks on paper’ aspect is more prominent and the illusion of an object with weight holds less. This might explain the reversal...\n\nOn the shape of the s curves, there is something complicated going on, which I don’t understand, but we respond to the swan’s neck etc as being ’right’ and graceful.\n\n"

But, if you excercise the issue visually, you can produce all caps with less difference between top and bottom that look better in that specific use, and normal caps with a difference tuned to the l.c., i.e. a bigger difference than normal for a small x-ht, and a smaller difference for a big x-ht., and see that the best caps for all uses are somewhere in between those two versions. So, in effect, if you decide to compromise the S and s for low resolution, you are, in effect either incompetent, or led by someone of similar abilities, but you are in no way actually helping the user, much.\n\n"
