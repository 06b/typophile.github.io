      "content": "Yes, the preservation of the exact shapes of Comic Sans, and the Papyrus trademark infringement are indeed \"of dubious legality\".\n\nHowever, if someone else were to draw new letter shapes that were between the hand-drawn look of Comic Sans and the calligraphic look of Papyrus, perhaps also applying limited weathering, to create, say, \"Ancient Blackboard\"... the thought of whether it would be \"so bad it's good\" would be amusing to contemplate.\n\nMind you, among all the amateur fonts on the legitimate free font sites, there may already be some candidates for an intermediate between Comic Sans and Papyrus.\n\nEDIT: After looking through a vast number of typefaces, amateur and professional, I finally found one typeface, a professional one, that could be said to inhabit the area of design space that lies between Comic Sans and Papyrus.\n\nI present to you:\n\n[ITC Tempus Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/tempus-sans-itc/)\n\nwith apologies to the font designer.\n\nAnd, just afterwards, I also turned up\n\n[Fidelma](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/lillie/fidelma/)\n\nwhich can also be considered an intermediate in this space.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want an intermediate between Papyrus and Radiant, you can get\n\n[Wheat](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/kenrusselldesign/wheat/)\n\nAlso, stretching a bit, possibly\n\n[Smart Casual](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/smart-casual/)\n\nmight lend itself to an application where one is searching for something between Papyrus and Comic Sans.\n\n[Demosfen](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/demosfen/) combines hand-drawn with exotic, but probably doesn't really fit in the category.\n\nAnd, of course, [Ereshkigal](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/ereshkigal/) and [Fable](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/fable/) are simply alternatives to Papyrus, and aren't in this category, even if they do both look _slightly_ more irregular and hand-drawn than the more strictly calligraphic Papyrus.\n\n"
