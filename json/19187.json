Also shades of Avant Garde.\n\n"

That m is a mess. An alternative is [Futura Maxi](http://web.archive.org/web/20070629151842/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=4&displayfontid=C.106298.0.0&fontRendererText=everbloom) whose super high x-height should make the unicasing an easier task.\n\n"
