Then I would have to add gaps in the E from Zekton, and find a new M and R, because neither of them matches, etc.   \n   \nNot a good solution. Occam's Razor, or something, suggests this is too complex. It's probably a font, not a cobbled up mixture. The small lettering looks like the same font, so there are a fair number of letters to see.   \n   \nCan anyone recognize this one, or is it custom? (They use Bauhaus as the other font on their [home page](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818042654/http:/techniceuticals.com/), so I don't think they get a lot of custom design done, if I had to guess.)   \n   \nThanks for helping me out. ![Techniceuticals Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818042654im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49846.gif)\n\n",
