It looks very familiar, but I just can't put my finger on it.\n\nHave tried Identifont and whatTheFont and they both gave no satisfying result.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ttl-fr-over.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140825060700/http:/typophile.com/files/ttl-fr-over.gif) | 834 bytes |\n\n",
