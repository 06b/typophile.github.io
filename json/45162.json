  "content": "Hi,\n\nCan anyone recommend a good companion to the Appleseed font? [http://fonthead.com/font-sampler.php?l=1&font=appleseed](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905213007/http:/fonthead.com/font-sampler.php?l=1&font=appleseed \"http://fonthead.com/font-sampler.php?l=1&font=appleseed\")\n\nIdeally I am looking for something which is like a regular non-italic version of the same face but without the rough edges. I wish to use it for a poster heading titled ’Sun & Wind’ with ’Wind’ being in the Applescript font.\n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions.\n\n [‹ ID Help](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905213007/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45173 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [looking for a font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905213007/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45170 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
