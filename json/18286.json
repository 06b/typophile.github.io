      "content": "Even though Zapfino contains many flourish lines, it certainly is not quite suitable for long texts as it distracts the reader from the content. In my 'own' opinion, try Poetica Chancery with variations or Snell Roundhand, Edwardian Script or even Shelley families as these are more readable. But it's solely up to your intentions and ideas.\n\n--- pinky kinky winky ---\n\n"
