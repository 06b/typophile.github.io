Just because two (or more) typefaces were not marketed as belonging to the same family, doesn't mean that they can't be paired or that they, in fact, weren't thought out as serif/sans counterparts.\n\nThat said, I think that several typefaces by [Adrian Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411222005/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adrian%20Frutiger) follow the same structure/skeleton, and so they can easily be paired and could even be part of the same family. Example [Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411222005/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/familytree.html) and [Glypha](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411222005/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/glypha/familytree.html).\n\nThe same is true for some [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411222005/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf)'s typefaces: [Optima](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411222005/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/familytree.html) and [Palatino](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411222005/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/familytree.html).\n\nBut, hey Ben, don't get upset. Here are two examples of super duper type families:  \n [Corporate](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411222005/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Corporate+ASE) (A, S, E), and [Compatil](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411222005/http:/www.linotype.com/94405/compatilfontfamilygroup-clan.html) (Exquisit, Fact, Letter, Text).\n\n(BTW, would you have paired the Compatil typefaces, had they been marketed separately? ;^)\n\n"

I've never said that one couldn't pair _(two or more) typefaces that were not marketed as belonging to the same family._ Indeed, I've paired Gill Sans and Perpetua together in book design myself... had they been designed as a related family, you might have less idea about which of the two I used as a text face, but I think you can guess.\n\nAs you'll know, the design motive is to pair them for their structural differences. I think Bringhurst says something about it, but you can see it in practice all around.\n\nIn point of fact, what Majoor says is supposition. _Had Eric Gill planned Joanna and Gill Sans as one family he would have been the first in history to design a family of serif and sans, **but he made them as separate designs with separate names.** _ And, I might add, at separate times for separate reasons.\n\nReading the Essay on Typography (which is set in Joanna but details the design of Gill Sans) gives one an idea of what Gill would have said about the very idea of a hybrid typeface, and it wouldn't have been complimentary. Gill Sans and Joanna had very different origins; one in signage and the other as a text face. One was an external commission and the other a self-initiated project. Some similarities arise because the same man designed them, but it is ridiculous to claim that they were conceived as sans/serif counterparts of the same type family.\n\n"

I'd argue that Perpetua Titling was born before Perpetua proper.\n\nPerpetua might have been used as a text face, it might still be, but it wasn't and still isn't a workhorse textface, it is more of a show pony.\n\nBoth Gill Sans and Perpetua have their roots in the stone carving of Eric Gill. Which is, more or less, display type.\n\n"
