The people on this list who go on endlessly about how there is no money in type design go on like that because they are the ones not making any.\n\nMost people on Typophile make their living as graphic designers and do some type for fun. I stopped doing graphic design in 1990. The only thing I do is type design, and while I do have a lot of fun, I do it for the money. It is a very interesting and well paid profession.\n\nIt is my belief that anyone who is not working full time as a type designer should keep their mouths shut about the difficulty in making money in the type business. How would they know, they are not in the type business.\n\nHappy now Chris?\n\n"
