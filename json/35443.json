In blue, at 87% opacity, is [Bitstream Stymie Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120064952/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/stymie/bold/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120064952im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/BitstreamStymie_5117.jpg)\n\n[edit] PS. Comparing a text written white on black to one written black on white is tricky, because of optical illusions.\n\n"
