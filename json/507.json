(GASP!) ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417084231im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) I mean the font, not most uses of it.   \n   \nUnfortunately, it's become so commonplace and so accessible that it's very often ruthlessly abused by unskilled hands.   \n   \nComputers have aided and abetted this trend, but it was true even before the days of desktop publishing. Helvetica began suffering its vicious cycle of abuse in the '60s and '70s, as \"generic\" became a trendy design thing.   \n   \nIn my opinion, Helvetica (whether the original or the \"Neue\" series) is at its most beautiful when used as a display font (perhaps the way some woodcut faces would be used), taking advantage of its range of weights and widths as well as its graceful and more subtle shapes. It should be incorporated into the design, rather than simply plastered mercilessly across a page like so much eggshell latex semi-gloss paint. The IRS and Adobe Acrobat will spend decades in Purgatory for their crimes against Helvetica.   \n   \nDon't malign the font just because 99% of its users are abusing it. Hasn't it been through enough pain? After all, this plain \"generic\" font became as popular as it is (before computers) for a reason.   \n   \nArial can't claim this. It was hacked out, mass-marketed and force-fed to hapless computer consumers.   \n   \nA few moments spent flipping through any preferred design annual or an issue of \"Graphis\" proves how stunningly Helvetica can be used, in the right hands.   \n   \nDavid   \n(Helvetica sympathizer)\n\n"

I'm enjoying this typographic parlance myself, but you have yet to say, \"in my humble opinion\".   \n   \nNow. In my humble opinion, the amount you pay for school and/or the amount you owe to the government when you finish, does not guarantee that one will have been educated by the best of the best. ;^)\n\n"

      "content": "No matter what we do we're living in a post-modern world. The beauty of it is we agree on disagreeing. No matter how 'Modernist' a piece of work might be, we won't be seeing it under the same light as our predecessors, because our world is not the same any more. So, a so-called 'Modernist' piece of design is simply a 'style' we pick from the 'big closet' in order to sell something to a particular group of 'target audience', who happen to be hip and cool and trendy yuppies. The same goes for 'traditionalist' designs.   \n   \nI think we not only live in a post-modern world, we also live in a multicultural world (at least in this part of the world). That even renders so-called 'movements' like Post-modernism and/or Modernism at best redundant, or at worst, meaningless. It's time to lose the 'isms' and focus more on what we are supposed to do: to communicate visually. As long as we keep our goal in mind, and to continue to be passionate about what it is that we're doing, then we'll be alright.   \n   \nI have two opposing views about typography: one of which is that typography is first and foremost about communicating the textual content as efficiently as possible; the other is utilizing the semantics of type to give design work particular 'atmospheres' or emotional responses. The first one is based on linguistic requirements and it's what 'traditional' (book) typography was (is) all about. The latter is based on visual requirements, which is what graphic design is about, mostly. Of course, these two views are not mutually exclusive and it is up to us to strike a balance between the two.\n\n"

I've been working hard to explain this position to others as of late. far too many of the indiscriminately Helvetica-wielding \"new media designers\" I've met have come from the sort of schools people brag about, offering claims such as \"best of the best\" in regards to their education.\n\n"
