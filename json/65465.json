  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm a type fan-if-still-newbie and first-time poster compelled to submit a request for a coworker. She's been asked to recreate a very simple type design--for a quick-turnaround offset print job that needs a speedy diagnosis. She tried many variations of classic serif faces, but couldn't get the \"C\" or the \"T\" quite right. I didn't have any further suggestions off the top of my head. Also, is this semibold in weight?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\n(.pdf file attached)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [4709\\_001\\_crop.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011155711/http:/typophile.com/files/4709_001_crop.pdf) | 868.13 KB |\n\n",
