His typefaces include Dante, Fontana, Griffo, Pacioli, and Zeno. Of these, unfortunately only Dante is available in digital form today. Dante is considered one of the most exceptionally beautiful text faces available.\n\nSource: [Biography](http://web.archive.org/web/20141017115501/http:/www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Mardersteig/GMardersteig.pdf) at the Klingspor Museum, Offenbach.\n\n[Dante](http://web.archive.org/web/20141017115501/http:/www.textism.com/textfaces/?id=17) at textism: twenty faces.\n\n",
