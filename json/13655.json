H. Griffith](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904160201/http:/typophile.com/wiki/C.%20H.%20Griffith) starting 7/19/39 through 2/6/41. These typeface [fleurons](http://web.archive.org/web/20140904160201/http:/typophile.com/wiki/fleurons) were inspired by Dwiggins' work with stencils and stencil artwork. One can clearly see some of the same shapes and curves in the design of his marionettes.\n\n",
