  "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI was looking for the exact typeface that Scrabble uses on their tiles. I am aware that there are many variations, but this is the one I am looking for. From my search on whatthefont, the closest I came to was the Superbastone family.\n\nI am actually looking for the traditional typeface of the old scrabble. Unsure if the image posted is the one that I am looking for.\n\nPlease help!\n\nCheers.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315072529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/scrabble-letters-step-11_6356.jpg)\n\n",
