  "content": "Hey! I am doing this research project based on \"City Typography\"\n\nObjective: To study the vernacular feel of the city and then draw a comparison on the basis of the type having certain nuances that were characteristic of the city they are symbolic of.\n\nSo basically i am trying to show like how city's elements like Culture, Cusine, Lifestyle, Architecture, Language, Fashion and Traditions, have some connection to its visual culture it showcases.  \nSo for this i visited Cologne and Paris and collected visual reference for the same.\n\nBut before analyzing it further i would want to know more about the visual culture or type culture of these two cities. As in how it has changed? How it has evolved overtime? The visual history of these two places.\n\nSo anyone who can help out? Or give me links which could help? or any information on the same.\n\nThanks :)  \nPLEASE HELP!\n\n",
