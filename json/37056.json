      "content": "Through QuarkXPress - it breaks down as Patty has put it 100C 88M 20K. But that is for Pantone Color Solid Coated and Uncoated. (Though the coated is a bright purple and the uncoated is a dusty blue.)\n\nIn the actual Pantone Color Formula Guide on how to make the color it reads: (this would have to be for spot color)  \n12 parts Pantone Blue 072 -70.6  \n,75 part Pantone Black -4.4 and...  \n4.5 parts Pantone Trans White -25\n\nand that is the secret to why a PMS color that we see doesn't print looking like we thought it would. I checked with my Pantone Process Simulator - (great book shows you how each color prints on coated and uncoated stocks - and how far off the PMS guide really is) but sorry, it only goes to PMS 600.\n\nIf you are trying to get close in a print job to the swatch of 662 - you may want to add about 20y and up the k to 30 or 40 - (that from hubby, the retired color separator...)\n\n"

      "content": "Those deep rich blues are one of the worst colors to accomplish in the CMYK gamut. They get muddy. I use Michael and Pat Rogondino's _Process Color Manual_ to estimate PMS conversions. There are a few blues in the manual that will come close to that, none of them will look exactly right on screen. Each has a shift one way or the other, so a compromise has to be made. My first pick was 100c 100m 10y 0k. My next look was 100c 90m 0y 10k.\n\nAre you going to a printer? Ask them. Almost every production source I use has extensively tested their equipment and know the best color estimation their machinery will achieve.\n\n"
