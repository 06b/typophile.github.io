Now, do you think it can be a freeware font from a free-download-fonts-site such as dafont.com? or its a customized work for this client?\n\nJust like you I also think it´s a terrible outcome if they tried to make a new original font for this work.  \nThey have applied (sorry for my English) in all the Province of Córdoba´s official agencies´s logotypes and they look terrible.  \nProvince of Córdoba, Argentina\n\n"
