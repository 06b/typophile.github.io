  "content": "hello.\n\nmy design partner and i are working on a resume template for a client - requested to be edited in word. we designed in apple pages first, so we used helvetica neue (75 bold), opentype.\n\nnow, i use a PC, and when i use indesign, i can choose the 75 bold style. but in word, i cannot seem to find it. basically, our client and i cannot see the typeface now. so i know it's not a translation issue, it's just something wrong with either office, or word, or windows!\n\nanyone familiar with this issue? are we just SOL with using word?\n\n",

If so, then you have an answer.\n\nYou know, I'd really love to use InDesign as a normal word processor, but it's too memory intensive. Some might say it's overkill, but there's no such thing as overkill when you're aware of spacing and other details. It exports your document to PDF smoothly as well.\n\n"

In that case you would have to choose the Regular style in Word and then press the Bold button. You would only see the Regular style in the font menu.\n\n"
