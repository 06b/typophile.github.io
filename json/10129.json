Amazon US and UK have not picked up the stock availability yet, but the BL shop will sell one to you.   \nFor my money Richard Southall is by far the most intelligent commentator on typeface design around: he writes well, with substantial command of the relevant theory and history, and exemplary understanding of the technology and its impact on design processes. There are very few people writing about typeface design at this level, and any commentator worth their salt should have read Richard's texts.   \nSo, I must be a fan, then.\n\n",
