Specifically:   \n   \n1. Albert Kapr   \nHe was a type designer and typographer who was the Art Director of TypoArt (the centralized press owned by the East German goverment). I'm trying to find out what his contribution towards the development of East German typography was and if anyone has samples of his work.   \n   \n2. Influencial typographers   \nDoes anyone know of any influential type designers from East Germany?   \n   \n3. VEB Typoart Dresden   \nI know that it became the centralized press for the East German govenment. It was an almalgamation of a few foundries, specifically Schelter and Giesecke of Liepzig. I am particularly interested in its output and developement during the GDR years.   \n   \nAny pointers...?   \n   \nJoyce\n\n",

But his greatest accomplishment, in my opinion, was that he managed to preserve and develop the fine art of type and book design in the Communist Germany. In fact, he was a devout Communist himself, and he managed to convince his fellow Parteigenossen, in both Leipzig and Berlin, that the quality of book design and printing is important for the image (and the economy!) of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik.   \n   \nKapr was one of the founding fathers of the prestigeous annual book design competitions (Sch\n\n"
