Our small (micro...nano?) press has been publishing eBooks for 2 years now and we are finally diving in to the world of print books. I know very little about choosing type faces, but I am not blind to the aesthetics of the printed word.\n\nWe are a publisher of both contemporary and historical fiction. I want a font that is easy reading, has a timeless character (leaning toward the modern), is distinctive, and is suitable for digital printing. My two top candidates at the moment are Hoftype Cala, and Okay Type Harriet.\n\nI want to stay away from the usual suspects for book design (Minion, Bembo, Garamond, ...) but not get too crazy either. Any help, or suggestions for further learning are welcome.\n\n",

Go into a bookstore & find something you like. Not like to look at, but to read. Rip off the design. The more you try to put your fingerprints on it, the greater the odds you'll make a mistake.\n\nYou mentioned two fonts, Hoftype Cala, and Okay Type Harriet. Well, the letterforms of Cala look like they will print on an offset press, using an uncoated stock. That's not true of the Harriet.\n\nI don't know these fonts, aside from seeing the letterforms as they pop up on Google. Space is a more important factor in reading than letterforms. How's the fit of the characters? If you set a page or two, using the trim, margins, and type size you want, how many leadings (linefeeds) work well with the chosen type size? If it's zero, it is a bad typeface. If it's one, there are many better.\n\n<cite>but I am not blind to the aesthetics of the printed word. </cite>\n\nWell, if we're talking about the printed word as it occurs in an object, the book, then you should already know the spacial relationships are most important.\n\nYour posting here, and your emphasis on \"something new\" suggests to me you're primarily interested in leterforms. I could be wrong; let's assume not. Readers don't much care about letterforms. They read words -- really, clumps of words. If you want to say letterforms have a subtle influence, I agree. But if a typeface has a major problem, appealing letterforms don't even start to make up for it.\n\nThere are a couple good presses in Texas -- award wining designers, with production values that go beyond \"graphic design.\" They might well be willing to talk, to give you a hand. Try Mary Ann Jacobs at Texas A&M, and/or Ellen McKie at UT-Austin.\n\nIf they would see you, a visit would be very educational, I'd think, and Texas A&M should be within driving distance from Houston. Kevin Grossman would be another contact at Texas A&M.\n\n"

But there _is_ such a thing as novelty of _texture_, and to me that is in fact where there's the most progress to be made in type design.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Galliard was a brilliant, beautiful face. And why do so many people say \"was\"? Because the relationship of its fine lines to thick was critical, as with the Didones, Bodonis, etc., and that relationship got messed up as the way of putting ink on paper changed. So, yes, the texture of Galliard changed, even though the letterforms didn't.\n\nTo me, all you're really saying is the good modern designers have finally read Smeijer's <cite>Counterpoint</cite>, and have learned that the drawing of the letterforms is is only a first step. The next is how a particular technology puts ink on paper or pixels on a screen. At the desired size. Something the guys in the metal era did automatically when they inked a punch & pressed it into paper.\n\n"

What I'm really talking about is things like Legato and Fenland.\n\n\"Counterpunch\" (sp.) is a great book, and helps those detached from previous eras a great deal (which describes me back when I read it). But it really just explains a precedent. For myself, the most valuable part of \"Counterpunch\" was the discussion of how the \"j\" could be reformed; this led me to my Alphabet Reform work, and to my rejection of chirographic type. BTW it's certainly a paradox that I'm pretty sure Smeijers doesn't agree with me on that in the least. :-)\n\n> Something the guys in the metal era did automatically when they inked a punch & pressed it into paper.\n\nNote however that the metal guys used _smoke proofs_ when cutting the punches, so they didn't actually see the accurate end-result very early - they needed a lot of experience to be able to reduce costly iteration. In digital we iterate much faster, and certainly much cheaper.\n\nhhp\n\n"

So a replacement for Adobe Garamond might be Sabon New or Verdigris. Many modern typefaces have nicer italics.\n\nI realize Galliard is popular, but I don't find it very readable in its digital forms. One of the major scientific magazines adopted it and changed again in less than a year (to Quadraat). There are more elegant typefaces, if that is what is desired.\n\n"

To be clear, I am not obsessed with letterforms. I am more concerned with how the text flows, the overall texture of the page, and especially what kind of \"feeling\" is produced. For example, I understand why Garamond is used so much since it produces a good looking page that is easy to read. However, when I show specimens of candidate fonts to our people, Garamond always gets the comment, \"old fashioned\". That isn't something I want people to associate with our work.\n\nMinion passes the look and feel requirements, and I may use it if nothing else can be found. Part of our branding strategy is to differentiate ourselves from other publishers. Setting books in Minion doesn't further that goal. I realize that readers aren't going to notice that we are using a popular font or something more obscure, but readers are not the only target audience. Potential authors, artists, designers, and editors will also see our work, and some of them may actually be paying attention to the details of how the books are put together and making judgments about us based on those observations.\n\n"

With all fonts, learn to look at the letterforms and what the final, printed result looks like. Eventually, you should learn what happens to a font\\* with all kinds of presses, and all kinds of paper.\n\nType on the screen isn't my forte, but likely something similar happens there, too.\n\nBTW, for those commenting on Galliard: it was pretty much always a \"digital\" font, if you count the Linotype 202 and 505 as \"digital.\" Some do, some don't. Some like to have it both ways, depending on what they're pontificating about.\n\nThe Bitstream versions were always digital. Finally, there was no change in the letterforms of Carter & Cone Galliard after it was released in the 1990s, again as PostScript.
