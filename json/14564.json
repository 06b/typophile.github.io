  "content": "So, for reasons I won't get into, I need to point someone towards a verson of Hiragino Mincho Pro that they can license for the PC. It comes with Mac OS X, but that doesn't help me, since I assume the license won't permit me to just email them the OT fonts, even thought it would be really easy and I got them for free.\n\nGrrr.\n\nDoes anyone know where this font (both weights: W3 + W6) are available? The person using them is a native Japanese speaker, so Japanese sites are fine.\n\n",

      "content": "Chris, you might be in luck! Hiragino Mincho Pro was not designed in Cupertino by Apple. They licensed it. Maybe the company they licensed it from will license you a PC version?\n\nSome designer/distribution info is embedded in the font (I viewed this information with Linotype's FontExplorer X utility, which will be publicly available soon):\n\nThe font was designed by JIYUKOBO Ltd.  \nTheir URL is [http://www.jiyu-kobo.co.jp/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311072616/http:/www.jiyu-kobo.co.jp/ \"http://www.jiyu-kobo.co.jp/\")  \nThe font's manufacturer/distributor is Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd.  \nTheir URL is [http://www.screen.co.jp/font/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311072616/http:/www.screen.co.jp/font/ \"http://www.screen.co.jp/font/\")\n\nHiragino is a trademark of Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. registered in Japan.\n\nDainippon Screen's site is all in Japanese. But maybe you can find an e-mail link?\n\n"
