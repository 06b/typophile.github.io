  "content": "Paul has done a very nice thing with the alternate forms in Tourist Gothic.\n\nI quote from the read me:  \n\"Stylistic sets have been designed to use all alternate characters together (set 1), or to apply alternates to one letter (series=all accented variations of that letter) only (sets 2-16).\"\n\nThis seems very flexible. Now, if only we had a way for apps to report something meaningful in their UI, rather than just \"Set 13\"!\n\n",

      "content": "John, thanks for your compliment. I'm glad someone appreciates this typeface. I got this way of thinking from [Mark Simonson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016232753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mark%20Simonson), when he was talking about his stylistic sets in [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016232753/http:/www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html).  \nHenry, basically what John is saying is that you can apply all the alternates at once or handpick which letters you want to be substituted by their alternates by using [stylistic sets](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016232753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/stylistic%20sets) when using the [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016232753/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) version of [Tourist Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016232753/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/touristgothic.html).\n\n"
