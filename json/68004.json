      "content": "what font are you using?\n\nyou mean export to PDF from InDesign..  \nyou have to make sure you include the fonts when exporting, because if you don't then InDesign creates a substitute.\n\nWORKAROUND  \nmake a copy of your InDesign-document so that you still have your text editable and the font is still a font.  \nin your 2nd copy-document you select your text and choose \"create outlines\" from the menu.  \nThis makes your text into an \"object\" and you cannot edit the text.  \nThen you export and everything will look okay and as you want it in the PDF.\n\n"
