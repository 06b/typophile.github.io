Thanks for giving me a lot of laughs this morning... :-D\n\nJoe, while we’re on the subject of how long I’ve been here on Typophile and have your attention, I’ve actually been here for 3 years and 50 weeks, according to [my earlier profile: ric](http://web.archive.org/web/20070824232417/http:/typophile.com/user/2022)... Is there any way to reunite the two under my current user name? I know a lot of other Typophilers had this problem... Thanks in advance. :-)\n\nFontplayer and Pearlstreet get my top votes. So does Nick Shinn for sheer humour (that’s right, I spelled it the British way). And Eben’s second one, with the blue background and input from Patty and Hrant — I like that one, too. Typographic Collaboration indeed! :-)\n\nFontplayer, I think I still have a heavily doodled high school notebook cover onto which I had stuck the RC Cola initials...\n\nLast but not least is Litera... I have thought of using those very two symbols as well, although not exactly like that — now I should make you one! (I’ve also thought of using the **R** and **C** from the New York City subway system)... I am going to try and post some recent sketches for my avatar later in the day, folks... Just so you know that I _have_ been working on an avatar! ;-D\n\n_But hey, don’t kill yourself._\n\nHrant is right, Eben — I should be the one working on my icon! :-)\n\nThanks again everybody!\n\n"
