  "content": "I am getting sick of FontExplorer, it keeps crashing on me. I don't know if the reason for the crashes are because I'm running a 64-bit OS (Windows 7 Professional) or not but it's become fairly annoying. So I'd like to switch to something else but I don't really know where to start. I did a Google search and there's been a whole crop of them that have popped up, which is amazing to me because I remember 5 years ago Windows users would sell their souls for a good type management program. I haven't really been able to find any solid reviews of any of them, however, and a search through the archives has also turned up nothing.\n\nWhat do you folks use these days for type management programs?\n\n",
