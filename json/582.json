There are people such as graphic designers, photographers, illustrators and much more who put their portfolios on the site. I always looks for companies who do type design work, but their not easy to come by. It would be great to see peoples work who come on this website, on the creativehotlist.com website. This site is a great site to promote your work. Please let me know what you think of it.\n\n [‹ Sans serif web font](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121101811/http:/www.typophile.com/node/567 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What if god had a font? what would it be? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121101811/http:/www.typophile.com/node/438 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
