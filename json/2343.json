Get Yves to give you some feedback since he is a musician. In terms of the type and banners everything looks boxed in and stiff, is this what their music represents?\n\n"

I would also pick your friend's   \nbrain a little more and show him/her some   \ntype samples.   \n   \n The current typeface choice seems more   \nclassical than bluesy, in my humble opinion.   \n   \nFor some reason, I see possibilities here:   \n   \n [http://onewayout.com/fonts/font.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021045827/http:/onewayout.com/fonts/font.html)   \n   \n [http://www.letterheadfonts.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021045827/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/)   \n   \nAlso, Hobson's Choice, as you prob. know is   \na misnomer ... perhaps you could play off that?   \n   \n   \nbj\n\n"
