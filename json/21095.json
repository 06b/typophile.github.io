I recall lots of British Rail brand guideline posters all over the walls in the commercial design studio. In those days, I was committed to drawing, painting and latterly, photography and had little more than a passing interest in graphic design and typography.\n\nGiven the quantity, and quality, of material on the walls, I suspect there was a connection between the design team and the college.\n\nI wish I had paid more attention at the time.\n\n"
