There’s a version of Fontographer (4.7) who runs in Mac OS X and the developers presented at Atypi the soon to be realized Fontographer 5.\n\nThat said, the way to go now is Fontlab: it enables a lot of good stuff but, as I said, it’s a tool that requires a lot of patience, training, watching forums like this…\n\nMore info:  \n [http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013100028/http:/www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/ \"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/\")  \n [http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013100028/http:/www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/ \"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/\")\n\n(As you may see, both softwares are from the same company now.)\n\n"

Of course, I am quite cozy with other programs like FontForge, which omashuisje is probably not.\n\nIf you want to make a font with Illustator as your drawing tool, then that's perfectly fine. FontLab has an option to import both Illustrator and Encapsulated Postscript files. Although, you will have to export each glyph individually (there might be scripts to do this, although I'm not exactly sure, as Illustrator isn't my tool of choice for drawing glyphs).\n\nIt takes a bit of practice, but it shouldn't be a total pain. I wish luck! :)\n\n"

Parts of the manual are repeated to let user find proper info in an easier way. And, as you already designed your font, you can even ignore some chapters about specific design tools.\n\nI'm doing a typeface in that way: design the glyphs in Illustrator, copy and paste them in FontLab. Instructions about how to bring the vectors from IL to FL are in page 520. You don't have to export each glyph as an EPS.\n\nYou may get the impression the program is somewhat complex, but this is not really true (in my opinion). There are some aspects of type design which are complex _per si_, as hinting and kerning.\n\nI did not used FontForge, so cannot talk about it.\n\n"

      "content": "I didn’t want to imply that omashuisje should stay away from Fontlab. If you want a state-of-the-art typeface, Fontlab is your best option. I am just saying that in the good old days Fontographer was great (“quite pleasing”, as omashuisje said). But certainly they were simpler times: only 256 characters per font, not so many options in the font info, no OT features to worry about… Really easy to get a font working in your system. That takes more effort today. I haven’t used it in years, but I remember that it was a lovely tool. omashuisje’s wish about a software “simple yet effective” sounds more like Fontographer to me, specially if he worked with that software in the past. But yeah, he can download the Fontlab demo, read the manual, and decide for himself.\n\n[BTW, this nostalgic feeling about Fontographer is shared by many people: otherwise Fontlab’s people wouldn’t resurrect it.]\n\n"

I guess it depends on how I read it. Sure, I've looked closely at other great fonts, in particular Gerard Unger's Big Vesta.
