I got a bit carried away and ended up adding all the Greek (monotonic) characters. I've no experience with Greek so was wondering how this looks. Any critique appreciated but specifically with regard to the Greek (I've included image of the Latin for comparison).  \nMany thanks,  \nDave\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Greeksans_5586.png)\n\n",
