      "content": "If you're talking about commercial fonts that are not showing up properly in Adobe apps, but are in system and other apps, then the problem is likely with the Adobe font caches. These get corrupted periodically, especially if you do a lot of loading and unloading fonts. Shut down all Adobe apps, delete the caches, (I usually reboot for good measure), and try again.\n\nIf you are talking about problems with fonts that you are generating yourself, then your problems may be due to technical issues with naming, linking and such. In this case, you may have better luck getting specific help with these kinds of issues in the [Build](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015023605/http:/typophile.com/forum/6) forum.\n\n"
