      "content": "I wonder how often things like a film’s logotype end up decided in a committee board room stuffed chock-full of studio representatives and stakeholders and marketing and advertising departments and film supervisors all goup-art-directing everything into mush. In such a minefield it’d probably be tempting to just open the door, pull the pin and toss in a comp with glowy blue papyrus.\n\nOf course, when you’ve made as much cash as James Cameron (who’s probably a far safer and more profitable investment bet than the stock market come to think of it)—I bet you’d have the pull to keep control over your film’s logoform...\n\nI like Armin Vit, and I’d like to see him put his own work up more often for the legions of snarky logo-sharks always commenting over at Brand New...love the sub-contracting idea, but I’d probably be too excited and greedy to subcontract. I mean, unless I was too busy doing title sequences for David Fischer or something...although hiring a great, raw, ink-loving calligrapher might get things to an interesting place visually...\n\n"

They hire an agent to recruit the best candidate for the money. The guy finds a French woman, she asks for 2 million dollars. Too much money. Then he finds a German man, he asks for 1 million dollars. Still too much. So he goes to Vartanik, an Armenian guy, and tells him to please give him a good price. Vartanik says 5 million dollars. The recruiter says: “Are you crazy, the others wanted much less! How could you ask for 5 million?!” Vartanik replies: “1 million for me, 2 million for the French babe to move in with me, 1 million for you to pick me for the mission, and we send the German.”\n\nhhp\n\n"

To say what it would look like, one would need to give examples.\n\nAdobe Present might be a good substitute for Papyrus if you’re opening a sushi restaurant, but it’s the wrong kind of font for this kind of movie. Ondine and Lydian are clearly wrong.\n\nEreshkigal, and Papyrus itself, might be good sources of inspiration. So might Codex or Oxalis.\n\nFor that matter, Outpost might be a goud source of inspiration... but that font doesn’t seem to be in MyFonts.\n\nAh... [Rhino](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103034714/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/rhino/) might be a good source of inspiration.\n\n"
