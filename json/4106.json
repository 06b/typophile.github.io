And betwen the X, the U, and the V   \n   \ni think that a reasonable way will be not to force all the characters with the two foots you gave them, and i also think that the Z could be solved some way else, it escapes a little bit of the other forms   \n   \nanyway   \nnicework   \n   \nCG\n\n"

It needs a lot of work but it could be fun.\n\n"
