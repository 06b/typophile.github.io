      "content": "Is that magazine [Vogue](http://web.archive.org/web/20141111191254/http:/www.vogue.com/), by any chance? Your sample reminds me of a typeface called Vogue which Intertype designed for Vogue Magazine in the 1930's.\n\nThe New Yorker used a custom typeface called NY Vogue Goat (an extrabold Vogue) until a recent design overhaul. Even still, there isn't currently a readily available copy of Vogue for license.\n\n[VF Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20141111191254/http:/www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/vf-sans-complete-family/), a typeface for Vanity Fair by James Montalbano, is really similar and has [only recently been available](http://web.archive.org/web/20141111191254/http:/www.behance.net/gallery/VF-Sans-Finally-set-free/10141327) for individuals to license. Montalbano says that he wasn't aiming to make a Vogue revival but I consider the multiple resulting weights of type to be a happy accident.\n\nTwo weights of Am Sans by Volker Busse, another similar to Vogue, used to be available through a lot of freeware sites. I'm not sure about the licensing details so I can't confidently recommend it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141111191254im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vogue-bold_6085.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Rob, you have an interstellar bulls-eye.  \nAFAIK nobody has done a digital version.  \nThe magazine was a unique publishing effort from 1953. An attempt to produce a Science Fiction magazine that was a slick, not a pulp. Hence the stylish typeface. Info on the magazine [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science-Fiction\\_Plus](http://web.archive.org/web/20141111191254/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science-Fiction_Plus \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science-Fiction\\_Plus\") BTW the wiki misses the fact that in addition to fiction, the magazine published extensive science speculation articles ranging from how to build an interstellar multi-generation spaceship -- with detailed plans -- to life on mars. I still have my copies of all seven issues.  \nDon\n\n"
