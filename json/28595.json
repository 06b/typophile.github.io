A potential client of mine has a logo that has been 'designed' this way:\n\n1.  \nWrite the company's name in Argo\n\n2.  \nScale the result 200% horizontally\n\n3.  \nThrow away the dot over i, or crop the ascenders, or both\n\n4.  \nVoila!\n\nA logo like this may seem trendy at first (to some people), but 10 years after, it is hopelessly outdated.\n\nCould you please tell me (I am gathering ammo for the designer/client meeting): when did we first see these examples of bad typography? Must have been in early 90s or what?\n\n--  \nsorenolsen  \ndenmark\n\nof all the fishes in the sea  \nthe little mermaid is one for me\n\n",

Try to explain to the client that their image is very valuable and worthy of careful design consideration. A cheap \"just like all the rest of them\" logo will not distinguish your client from his competition or help position them favoorably in their customer's eys. Good things only come from good hard work. I wish you the best in your meeting! We have all been there.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

And hey, it looks new, different, and interesting -- or at least it did 15 years ago, if you didn't find it horrifying.\n\nBut perhaps your client is into a retro-vernacular-1991 kind of thing?\n\n\"Ransom Note\" typography was popularized by Jamie Reid in his designs for the Sex Pistols in 1977, and used by Neville Brody in The Face magazine (before he designed his own typefaces).\n\n"

If you skip the analysis, and just scale a word 200 percent and crop the ascenders and call that logo design, that is wrong.\n\n--  \nsoren olsen\n\n"
