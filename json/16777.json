  "content": "Hi there, I was wondering if anyone had any ideas of a typefaces that are suited to body copy for corporate literature. Previously the designs in question used arial, but they are keen to 'push the boat out'(!) and go for something a little more contemporary and funky. any suggestions?\n\nI'm talking about a company involved in finance etc so a suitable typeface should evoke solidarity and dependability, not too 'fun' for want of a better word.\n\nAny thoughts at all are greatly appreciated.\n\nR.\n\n",
