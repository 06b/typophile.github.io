      "content": "I would personally think that aligning all three of the small lines of information to the same width would strengthen the grouping you having in the middle. As well, the dates being screened seems an odd choice. I would think 47th season isn't something to hide.\n\nThe use of Bookman seems at odds with the use of Goudy. The use of the single script is a nice start at adding flair, but I think it is also at odds with the Bookman. The problem of using Bookman italic is that the letters don't flow one to the next and just jar against one another. I wonder if the Goudy Italic might do better?\n\nIf you find yourself wanting to add a white stroke to something that is already light, I would suggest simply making the cream color lighter instead of using the white stroke.\n\n"
