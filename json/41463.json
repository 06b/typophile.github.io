I once read about that, but unfortunately forgot who had done it.\n\n[SZM](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621113432/http:/sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/) is a weekly supplement to the paper. [Mirko Borsche](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621113432/http:/www.mirkoborsche.com/) used to be its art director for the last three years … I don’t know if he was involved.\n\n[Typeforum.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621113432/http:/www.typeforum.de/modules.php?op=modload&name=XForum&file=viewthread&tid=451) doesn’t know either … guess it’s time to ask directly.\n\n"
