After viewers became aware of the clarity in early proofs, they would soon start to complain the originals were too light, or too dark. So all of the possible weights of each size, more or less are cut on the same widths. Thus, yes... the lighter ones are airy, and the darker ones are pushing their widths. But the general idea is that either you, your topic or your rendering environment have to be pretty extreme to want the extreme weights in these designs for text or other small sizes.\n\nCheers!\n\n"
