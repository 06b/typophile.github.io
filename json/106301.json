  "content": "I'm currently designing a website featuring a centred type layout, and I'm looking for a serif typeface that fulfils some rather specific criteria.\n\nThe application is a list of projects, each with a year value (i.e. Project name 1965—1967). The type is set at 40 pixels in size (equivalent to 40pt size at 100% in InDesign).\n\nI'm looking to use a display serif with old-style figures, which is available to license as a web font (ideally through an @fontface service). Manually kerning the numerals is beyond the scope of the project (since the number values are generated dynamically by a CMS) and as such I need a serif typeface with kerned Old style figures.\n\nIf anyone is aware of any options that fill the above criteria, I'd be much obliged if you could point me in the right direction.\n\n",
