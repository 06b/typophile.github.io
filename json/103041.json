  "content": "Hi,\n\nThere is a logo I'm working on and now I've been struggling to find a typeface that would nicely complement it. I thought that I could perform some crowdsourcing here on Typophile. I can't show the logo now but the attached image sums it up pretty well. It's geometric, modern, rounded, drawn on a grid but at the same time looks like made with a flat calligraphic brush.\n\nI must say that so far only Museo looks like a good match but I'm slightly put off by the fact its free and ubiquitous. If nothing better is found I might fall back to it, however.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nKey words to consider: contemporary, community, traditional values.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420030648im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font-shape_3865.png)\n\n",
