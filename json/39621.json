  "content": "Hi all,\n\nFirst post, but been a reader for a long time.\n\nI’m updating a client’s logo and ran into a snag. The logotype basically hasn’t changed since 1975, we just updated the bug. However, the owner of this company just through a curve-ball and asked the we replace the ” curved y” with a “normal slanted y”.\n\nOf course this drove me nuts, I thought their original styling was good, why mess with it? Especially at this point - we’ve already jumped into laying out new web and print materials. Anyway, I re-created the y, but it just doesn’t look right to me. Also, is the kerning OK? I was considering doing this and a “small” version with more character spacing.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907003717im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/KellyPipe_1_5255.png)\n\nI’m a graphic designer - just picking up what little I know about type here and in magazines / tutorials. I have thick skin though, so fire away. Any and all suggestions for the “y” as well as the rest of the type and logo would be appreciated.\n\nThanks for your input!\n\nDaniel Peterson  \n [Artesian Design Group](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907003717/http:/artesiandesigngroup.com/)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [KellyPipe\\_1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907003717/http:/typophile.com/files/KellyPipe_1.pdf) | 236.43 KB |\n\n [‹ design company logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907003717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38737 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [my KP logo... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907003717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34545 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Both with the new y and the old y. that might tie the whole thing together.\n\nAll that said, I’m not sure you really need the bug...at least not used at the same time with the logotype. The logotype seems sufficiently unique to stand on its own.\n\n"

However, I don’t know the right way to fix the heaviness without breaking any type rules or making it look disproportionate. Any suggestions on how to make the ’y’ less heavy while still keeping the proportions?  \nRight now, the ’y’ has the same thickness as the other stems.\n\nThanks for the replies so far.\n\nDaniel Peterson  \n [Artesian Design Group](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907003717/http:/artesiandesigngroup.com/)\n\n"

      "content": "For optical correction it’s nearly impossible to tell in a gif at this size.\n\nHowever, your e’s look like they have issues:  \nThe thickness of the top horizontal and the crossbar look reversed. The crossbar needs to be thinner and the top thicker. The counter of the e should start roughtly in the same place as the counter of the p. So just lower the counter a bit to start with and then cheat it if you have to. And the overbite is a little severe.\n\nAlso, on the curved-tail y version: consider relating the bottom counter of the e and the counter between the tail and body. Probably need to shrink the x-height a bit and increase the descenders a hear too.\n\nIf you do go with the diagonal y, you’ll want to make the left side slightly thicker than the right side. That way they will look even. And drop the crotch a little bit (or cheat it with a curved crotch if you prefer).\n\nYou could also try the diagonal y with a curved tail that echos the e. But my guess is that won’t work.\n\nWould they consider changing their name to Kellipipe? :-)\n\n"
