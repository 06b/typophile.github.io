For a school project called “Global – Regional” i have setup an [online survey](http://web.archive.org/web/20071119013620/http:/www.questionpro.com/akira/TakeSurvey?id=823625). It takes about 3 minutes to fill out. Everything else is described on the website.  \nThis project aims to answer the question if design will be more regional or more global in style, colors, etc. in 2015 than now - and why that. Your answers will help me finding an answer.  \nTHANK YOU.\n\n [‹ Problems with vector logotype - could you help me?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071119013620/http:/typophile.com/node/39198 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fonts with \"Co\" ligatures ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071119013620/http:/typophile.com/node/39183 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "A quick and rather broad observation:\n\nI’d imagine global would by 2015 include a lot more regional strands. That’s as compared to today when global is, by and large, Western.\n\nOn the other hand, regional styles would quite likely get more global in expression. That’s something we’ve seen a good deal in India over the past decade.\n\n"
