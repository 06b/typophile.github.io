  "content": "Hi All.   \n   \nI figured I would consult this knowledgeable group with my question.   \n   \nI'm trying to use the House Gothic 23 font set. Looking at the House Industries website at the typefaces available with House Gothic 23 (extended, condensed), I can't seem to find any of those in the set I have --   \n   \nI have ones called Bold 1, Bold 2, Bold 3, Bold 4   \nAlso Light 1, 2, 3, 4   \n   \nI know with some House fonts there is a key combination you need to do to access some of the styles. Or am I just missing something? I see 14 elements in my HouseGothic 23 folder.   \n   \nthanks so much in advance   \n-sg\n\n",
