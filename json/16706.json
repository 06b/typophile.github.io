Since we still can’t post images in our replies (Aaarghhh!!), I could set up a page to show samples of Forever that came with the Creative Alliance Partners Library collection CD. Let me know if you want to see complete samples of selected fonts in the Forever family, which has two versions, eight weights of each and italics for all of them.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
