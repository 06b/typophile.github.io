  "content": "Alright!\n\nSo, I’ve started working on this project with [www.hugamug.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121184140/http:/www.hugamug.com/ \"www.hugamug.com\"), an online coffee company who is preparing to revamp their webpage, and would like to work on improving their identity at the same time. The logo is rather outdated, and there is very little printed material they use. I’ll be first working on improving the logo, then helping to choose some fonts they will continue to use in their marketing materials.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121184140im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hugamuglogo_4595.jpg)\n\nThis is their current logo, and as you can see, they’re using the same font, Maiandra for their other places on the webpage. I’d like to change the font to a more simple sans serif font, and first suggested Univers, in a variety of weights, for their marketing materials, however the client finds Univers too neutral, and would like something that is more unique to the brand, as well as has more ’personality.’\n\nUltimately, the question in more simple terms; what’s a good alternative to Univers that has more personality. The client also uses [Air Millhouse](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121184140/http:/www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=466) in print, and would like to continue using this. I like the font in some applications, but need to find some other fonts that compliment that as well..\n\nI realize I’ve been a bit longwinded here, and possibly a bit confusing. I’m not sure how much help I’ll be able to receive here, and I really appreciate any responses here.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121184140im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GiftCard1_3812.jpg)\n\nTo finish things off, here’s a recent gift card idea I’ve started to play around with. I like the overall design so far, and would like to keep this kind of feeling throughout more designs. Feel free to comment on the layout and such here, as I can use all the help I can get. =P\n\nThanks so much to anyone who replies, I really appreciate the help!\n\n- Jibran\n\n [‹ Extended Latin/Non Latin Letter frequency question: single phoneme letter pairs?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121184140/http:/typophile.com/node/40267 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for a \"Ch\"-ligature ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121184140/http:/typophile.com/node/40253 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’ll probably be more meaningful if you were to post images of the reworked logo/options and then seek suggestions on the brand typography. Otherwise you’d be getting somewhat generic type recommendations.\n\n“To finish things off, here’s a recent gift card idea I’ve started to play around with.

I’d drop the Extended and Extra Condensed versions of Univers and work with just the regular one.\n\nBtw what is the idea behind the blister sort of effect?\n\n"

I’m kind of testing the waters as it is, and hopefully will start to get some more ideas up very soon. I’ll plan to post up some sketches as well as some initial designs in the next day or so, in order to kind of give everyone a better idea of what I’m thinking of.\n\n“It helps to know what size the card is. As it is the colours look nice, but you’re doing too many things with type - variations of font, weight and colour. I’d drop the Extended and Extra Condensed versions of Univers and work with just the regular one.”\n\nSorry, the card is going to be digital only, probably in sizes between 125px and 500px, which is also the reason for the ’blister sort of effect’. The client showed me some images that he liked, all of which included this effect, so I included it. I definitely agree with the variations of the font, I’ll narrow that down and post up some future versions of that as well. Unfortunately, the client wants the gift card available as soon as possible, therefore before we revamp the identity stuff, so I need to kind of plan ahead for that before I can spend much time on the logo.\n\nI really appreciate the comments, I should have some new images up soon.\n\nThanks!\n\n- Jibran\n\n"

      "content": "Hi there. I Jibran is off to a good start. A couple of suggestions:  \n-Drinking coffee is a warm and comforting thing, as is suggested by the name “hugamug”. Although your new logo may express this in a more subtle way than the original logo, I believe it is an important message to get across. Perhaps the choice of typeface will convey some of this warmth.\n\n-For the gift card, I am assuming it will be double-sided so I would find out if you need to leave room for any of the following:  \n(bar code, disclaimer, URL, contact info, etc)\n\nGood luck.\n\n"

      "content": "What’s wrong with their use of Maiandra? Univers is WAAY too bland for a company with a name like that. You trying to turn them into Starbucks or something?\n\nThe first thing in a re-design shouldn’t be, “What can I scrap,” it should be, “What should KEEP.”\n\nBefore scrapping the old idea completely, try re-configuring the usage of the old tyepface. Perhaps matching that really loose typeface with something tighter, but cleaner. I’m thinking something like Cronos Pro from Adobe. Something clean, but with some of the edge taken off.\n\nOr go the opposite direction, and bump up Maiandra up to the black weight. Black=coffee? You’ll certainly have a unique identity that is warm and huggable.\n\n"
