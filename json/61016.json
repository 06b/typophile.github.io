This has no effect on the font, but you might find it convenient to have all you stylistic set features grouped together in the feature tree.\n\nHaving lots of features, including some that I suspect are ‘hijacked’ -- i.e. does your ‘Titling’ feature actually contain titling forms, or are you using the feature for something else? -- doesn't really ‘explain’ things to me, because I don't know what you're trying to achieve. Is this a Hebrew font? What are all the things that you are putting into these stylistic sets?\n\n"

This is a text distinction, and if you want a text that includes both forms and can switch between different display options, then you probably should use XML tagging of the character strings and base your display options on that. OpenType glyph substitution isn't designed to be able to handle this kind of thing.\n\nNever mind hijacking layout features: you're hijacking the whole layout model.\n\n"

I've never noticed this before. I presume it is intended for use in Arabic, but I can't think to what OTL feature it corresponds. In Arabic, what we might consider stretched alternates are a class of swash letters.\n\nI'll write to my contacts at WinSoft and find out how this function works.\n\n"

So if it can do these things it is only by chance, and you can't expect it to always be able to do everything you want in this regard, because you might eventually run into reasonable limitations. And even if you can do these things with OTL, I still maintain that you _should not,_ because what you describe are properly text manipulations, which should be applied at the character level, not at the glyph level.\n\n"

This is a legacy function that makes use to two private features, not part of the OpenType specification, to identify left and right parts of stretched connecting forms in a particular Arabic font. This was implemented to support this Arabic font, Decotype Naskh (not to be confused with the Naskh type from Decotype used in the new Tasmeem add in to InDesign), which was originally in the Middle East version of PageMaker and which used this mechanism because OpenType contextual substitutions were not available at that time. This function is only included in InDesign ME for backwards compatibility.\n\n"

This distinguishes terminal swash glyphs on reduced widths from those on full widths.\n\n"
