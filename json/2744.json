But I'm wondering, does anyone know of a forum where I can talk technical details.   \n   \nI have questions ranging from pre-press (which I know is a big can of worms) to layout / grid systems (which I know is a bigger can of worms).   \n   \nCan anyone point me to any good online resources? Or can we start a discussion here?   \n   \nNathan\n\n",

      "content": "Changing from Web to Print. Yippie, the tide is turning. I always found webcoding boring as hell and am SO happy to have a partner who is ace at doing Flash/ActionScript stuff, so I can concentrate on working on PAPER. I'm getting old, must be why I LOVE the web but dislike progging. Maybe I'm just too intuitive and impulsive for that, all my codes were always buggy as hell :-).   \nIf you have any questions, I'm sure folks here can help you out. As typography is still more a print thingie, many here will know how to get a decent PDF done and grid and layout IS typography, so... it is even ontopic :-)\n\n"

      "content": "Currently, I find myself printing out a bunch of drafts on my inkjet just to check type sizing, etc. Type looks so different when printed vs when it's one screen. The size and weight always throw me.   \n   \nI need to get confident about selection there.   \n   \nHD, you mentioned PDF. Is that the prefered way to hand off to a printer. Not sure about Quark, but InDesign has a nice packaging feaure that lets you export all the images, settings, fonts, etc. Very handy.   \n   \nAlso, my existing issue has to do with margins. I'm doing a brochure piece that has a contemporary design style (you know, a 1/4\" white margin that frames moody background photos). Anyway, it appears fine in InDesign, but when I print, my margins seem off? Looks like I have everything set correctly. Can I post the file here for someone to take a look?   \n   \nIf so, what format? PDF or the actual InDesign file?\n\n"
