  "content": "hi everyone,   \n   \nI am new to this discussion area but decided to give it a try. Here is a logo for FinnAgora. Comments are welcome.   \n   \nThe organization is a Finnish Institute in Budapest. Main focus on delivering culture and science projets from Finland to Hungary and developing a contact network for these in Budapest. The main idea behind the design is a snowflake with movement. The dots create networks which communicate to the outside. I know typography (Meta) is a bit pass\n\n",

      "content": "Very nice, although a bit ideographic, I don't know if there is any specific meaning you associate with the visual sign. The light blue might prove difficult in print technically and also might be a problem to read in outdoor applications, like on posters etc, depending on the light and reading distance. Meta, imo, is quite unused these days, and with its heyday gone, I feel one can use it again without being to me-too. The fi, despite there not being a REAL ligature in the font itself, as Spiekerman kept the i-dot and the f apart, should be remodelled to a real ligature, perhaps. It would add a nice touch of individuality to the typography. But at the very least you should use the ligature provided with the Font.\n\n"

As in Illustrator which expands both sides of the vector thereby making it larger than the other type or 2. create the stroke on a character then copy that character and make a mask of the stroked character\n\n"
