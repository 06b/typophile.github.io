But it does give me grief when I try to find \\*just\\* the right font for a given application.\n\nSo I got Suitcase for Windows. The thing is, I have a lot of fonts and I was hoping that the manager would be able to sort files by category...but it can't.\n\nDoes anyone know of a way to either sort the files on the disk into categories, or know of a manager that can do this?\n\n...Mike\n\n",

This, depending on the number of fonts in your library, can be very labor intensive, but in the end more useful to you than any factory-supplied organization system.\n\nStill it would be handy to have a guide to go by. The Typowiki might be a good place to start looking for one.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the suggestions everyone.\n\nI agree that categories are somewhat arbitrary, but I'm cool with that...50 arbitrary categories are much easier to deal with than 6000 individual fonts :)\n\nI tried fontorg and while it is a cool little app, it doesn't do anything more than what I can do with FontDoctor, which I already have. If you don't have font doctor though, I recommend it.\n\nI tried the typowiki last night before I posted, hoping that someone had already asked this question and found a solution...but alas, nothing.\n\nI don't look forward to the hours and hours it is going to take me to sort all my fonts.\n\nEven the ability to preview fonts in Explorer would be welcome, because i could bin them that way...the unfortunate thing about suitcase is that once the fonts are sorted into groups within that program, the list of fonts within each group cannot then be exported. If they could be, i could just write a little perl script to do the sorting into folders thing for me.\n\nMy search continues. Any Mac or Windows suggestions are welcome, as i have and use both.\n\n...Mike\n\n"
