In brief, it was a lot of fun, Hrant spoke well and was an engaging speaker, and the questions were indeed the best part! It's interesting seeing graphic design students wrap their heads around the special challenges posed by typeface design. I was left with the strong regret that Art Center is too far away for me to take Hrant's class.\n\n"
