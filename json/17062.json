      "content": "Good books mentioned above. Grid Systems shows examples of a 32 unit grid, and makes the point of showing how versatile it is. I’d suggest building symbolic value into the grid design. I believe the tree of life, with its sepheroth and paths yields a 32 sum. Look at a GO board as well (Chinese/Japanese Board game). It has a node for each day of the year. You may be able to design something that both functions well and also holds more esoteric information.\n\n"
