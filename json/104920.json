  "content": "Hello everyone. I am new; hopefully I am posting under the correct topic.\n\nI was given a piece of printed material with the word “Time” in the title.  \nIt is set in Minion Pro typeface, and the capital T and small i seem to be a ligature because the dot of the i is not present, and the bottom serif of the i sits within the width of the T hat. (please refer to the attached jpeg)\n\nI have looked over the entire glyphs of the typeface several times, tried selecting both Ligature and Discretionary Ligature.  \nNone of them seem to give me the result.\n\nWhat is definite is that the word is only within Minion Pro family (glyphs included), in one text frame only, the letters are not kerned, are evenly tracked, and the i is not rendered in any way to have the dot removed.\n\nLastly, I have also tried using the number 1 and Latin small dotless i; however, none of the number 1 resembles the i on the page, and latin dotless i would need to be either kerned or tracked close to the T, but I was told that these two actions are not involved.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.  \n\\*Please see the attached jpeg of what the word supposedly looks like; I created it using Latin small dotless i, reduce the tracking between T and i.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Ti ligature.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211443/http:/typophile.com/files/Ti%20ligature_0.jpg) | 39.68 KB |\n\n",

That would satisfy, in some way, all the given requirements.\n\n"

The display could be kerned tighter, perhaps.\n\nOr perhaps Optical Metrics is applied and the set size is very large. Not sure if the algorithm would kern it so tightly, but I wouldn’t put it past it.\n\n"

There is at least a `salt` table in Minion Pro so here is another experiment. This time, I used a little file I called `salt.fea` with the following lines\n\n    languagesystem DFLT dflt;\n    languagesystem latn dflt;\n    \n    feature salt {\n      script latn ;\n        language dflt ;\n           sub \\i by \\dotlessi ;\n    } salt ;\n    feature kern {\n     script latn;\n       language dflt ;\n          pos \\T \\dotlessi -115;\n    } kern ;\n\nI used it to define the fontface `\\head` in the following luaLaTeX file\n\n    \\documentclass{article}\n    \\usepackage{fontspec}\n    \n    \\setromanfont{Minion Pro Bold Subh}\n    \\newfontface\\head[FeatureFile=salt.fea,\n                      Style=Alternate]{Minion Pro Bold Subh}\n    \\begin{document}\n    {\\head Time} in Toronto\n    \\end{document}\n\nwhich gave the following output:\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211443im_/http:/typophile.com/files/timeintoronto_5104.png)\n\nOf course, the \"font face\" `\\head` used to write \"Time\" is of little use but at least the word \"Time\" is properly coded, without cheating with an dotlessi in the input. The worst that can happen if `salt.fea` is used with a font that misses a `salt` table is that the output simply shows \"Ti\" instead of \"Tı\" which is exactly as should be.\n\n"
