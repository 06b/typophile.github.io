But if it's earlier and more classic in feel, try one of the Didots (such as Hoefler's) for larger heads, and maybe FF Acanthus with old style figures for the body copy. I just went to New York's Dahesh Museum for a show of large French art books created as a result of Napoleon's abortive campaign in Egypt, and published around 1808, and their large heads used a beautiful Didot, and for the body copy, the nearest equivalent now would be either Acanthus or ITC Bodoni Twelve. Just depends on the period feel being targeted.\n\n"

One text font, roughly equivalent to Acanthus today, was fascinating, esp the tiny crossbar in the middle of the lower case l character (as in love), which was printed clear as a bell...at the Morgan Library recently, I saw another big French art book around that period, an edition of Racine, with a big rendering of that same text font, impeccably printed...\n\n"
