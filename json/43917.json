The forms for the fonts are based on a video of smoke being blown into soap through a straw and how the bubbles rise to the surface.

Some comments were to work on refining the “bouncing” of the tops of the letters as your eye reads across and to fix the spacing between the letters to be more consistent. I was just hoping to get some suggestions as to how to go about doing that. He had suggested that the class post on typophile to get some feedback.\n\n"
