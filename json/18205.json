Ligatures are placed by applications  \nthat use fonts. The only responsibility of a font is to  \nstore enough information so that applications can work  \nwith ligatures. Type 1 and truetype fonts can both store  \nligatures. In the AFM files of type 1 fonts, one can store  \nadditional information that may help applications with  \nautomatic ligature subsitution and placement of ligatures  \non the page. The famous GPOS and GSUB tables in OpenType  \ncan be introduced in truetype fonts as well--there is nothing  \nthat ties these tables umbilically to OpenType.\n\nSo, how exactly are OpenType fonts better?\n\n"

      "content": "\\> InDesign and better fonts\n\nLuc, nice to see you here again. You may have missed my point, I said InDesign _and_ OpenType fonts provide an _automatic_ solution. By _better_ fonts I meant OpenType fonts with more ligatures (mapped using GSUB) than your typical Type 1 font. As opposed to _same_ OpenType fonts with the same number of ligs as your typical Type 1 font.\n\nTheoretically someone could write a page layout app that would do a good job with sets of Type 1 or regular TrueType fonts (perhaps referencing an online database mapping the expert sets in some kind of virtual GSUB). But is seems like an awful lot of work when OpenType provides all the information an app needs.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"

But they can be found  \nin many blue-blooded TrueType fonts as well. These are  \nmostly for Arabic scripts where positioning and replacement  \nare crucial.\n\nThanks to google's capability of opening binary files such  \nas TrueType files, you can find examples of such fonts by  \na simple search such as  \n filetype:ttf GSUB\n\nI do not wish to hijack this thread though.\n\nAll the best and see you soon,\n\nLuc\n\n"
