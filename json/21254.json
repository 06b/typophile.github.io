When I did a search for PC Font Viewers, Typograf seemed to come up as the preferred choice, however I thought it was pretty piss poor, the interface was out of the 1970's and half the options didn't work on XP64, I guess I'm used to Macs were the Font managment options are really good.\n\nHowever, Babelmap is not bad, I'm working mostly with OpenType fonts across platforms and BabelMap has very comprehensive unicode display options, plus it's donation ware. Anyhow hope this is helpful to anyone looking for a good Unicode font viewer.\n\n",
