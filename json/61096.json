  "content": "Strange question maybe but has been bugging me for a while: Does anyone ever make different optical sizes of logos – not necessarily the type, but the mark itself? And if not, why not?\n\nBackground: I'm currently working on a logo (and I don't think I can post it at the moment, so I'd appreciate a discussion on the \"theoretical\" level) that needs some detail that makes it vivid at large sizes (think company car decal) but gets lost at business-card sizes (at least on my printer).\n\nSo do you think there are any cogent reasons against making a \"HD\" and a \"lo-fi\" version of the same mark, one finer, the other more sturdy?\n\n",

BTW I would say that the logo in question works when scaled – no \\*crucial\\* detail is lost –, it just doesn't look its best at all sizes equally; and that got me wondering – if we're talking about the importance of optical scaling in type, shouldn't we accept its merits for logos as well – in terms of making the \"HD\" and the \"lo-fi\" version \\*optically\\* consistent/optimized instead of just mathematically scaled?\n\nKent, in this case it looks like I'll be in charge of most (if not all) of their printed materials myself, and will also be advising them on use of the logo in other media, so I can luckily have an eye on proper usage.\n\n"

Absolutely, you need to make those optical adjustments when you convert a vector logo (for print) into a very small bitmap logo (for web). To allow Photoshop to make your bicubic downsampling decisions for you would be insane.\n\nIf the logo stays in a vector format with a minimum size I don't see the need for another version.

      "content": "Hi Altaira,\n\nAn obvious example seems to me the current trend of 3D-ifying logos and adding subtle beveling and gradient to imply a slightly rounded look.\n\nWhen used small, however, the '2D' or simply two-colour version can be used. For example, Apple's logo is this glassy blob thing writ large, but they can fall back on the simple silhouette Apple when using it small. Other examples include most car manufacturers (e.g. Ford, GM) and UPS have '3D' updated versions of their logos as well as the original '2D' versions. The extra detail does add some extra interest at large sizes. A Google images search will demonstrate any of the above examples.\n\nWhether you agree with the trend is another matter. I heard a (possibly made-up) story that UPS commissioned Pentagram to explore possibilities for an update on their classic logo by Paul Rand. They racked up the allocated number of billable hours but eventually came back to UPS and presented them with all the reasons that their existing logo was a classic and shouldn't be fiddled with. UPS paid them but then went to FutureBrand to get their current 3D-effect shield with cliched swoosh and rounded-ish sans.\n\nOn a somewhat related note: 'How long should a logo last?' - Johnson Banks: [http://www.johnsonbanks.co.uk/thoughtfortheweek/index.php?thoughtid=310](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419132812/http:/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk/thoughtfortheweek/index.php?thoughtid=310 \"http://www.johnsonbanks.co.uk/thoughtfortheweek/index.php?thoughtid=310\")  \n\"Yellow Pages have cut the umbilical chord that held them to Futura and opted for one of those ubiquitous humanist soft sans serif solutions. Paradoxically, by opting to hit the more modern button they’ve traded long term stability for short-term refresh, but if that notches up a few better points in tracking, that may be deemed a success. There’s also a wry typographic twist there, as the typeface named after the future (Futura) is dumped for something of the present.\"\n\nH\n\n--  \nHenry Hadlow - [Graphic Design / Art Direction](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419132812/http:/work.dlow.org/)\n\n"

I don't know how the company you are designing for works, but usually the logos/style sheets I get are requested by a marketer and sent to them from another marketer.

But I think especially with a logotype the characters need beefing up for tiny sizes. And isn't it <cite>more</cite> work to create different versions of the logo rather than less?\n\n"

And when working with an outside vendor they may send them the wrong logo version.\n\nI'd agree there are occasional instances where it makes sense, but most professional logos are designed to look good large or small, and are scalable vector files.\n\n"
