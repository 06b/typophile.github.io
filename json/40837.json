Also, it is generously extended compared to the Tub Hauler sample.\n\nThe only other vaguely similar font I can find with a head serif on the A is [Imperium](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706170202/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/imperium/), but it is not as similar to the sample, and the rest of the letters are even less similar.\n\n"

Unfortunately, he was a poor record keeper. He told me that himself, once, when I inquired about the inspiration for one of his fonts. Not only couldn’t he not give attribution for most of his fonts - he couldn’t even remember the source material for many. Somewhere, in some old catalog, magazine, graveyard or whatever is the original for this font - or at least the base Imperator Roman font. I wish I knew what that was.\n\nAh well. There are some jewels in his creations and I’m glad he made ’em.\n\n"
