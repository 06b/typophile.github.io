  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a small problem with my 8 character in a new font. In Fontographer, the outlines appear fine and create a smooth curve, but when the font file is generated it does something to the 8 and gives it a weird corner. Comments welcome. Thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [fontographer.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021063746/http:/typophile.com/files/fontographer.jpg) | 87.6 KB |\n| [howitlooks.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021063746/http:/typophile.com/files/howitlooks.jpg) | 29.18 KB |\n\n",

Chances are it's related to either a stray point, or an unclosed path, or weird start point or something. Also, you might get better responses to a technical issue like this by posting in the Build forum. (But don't post twice -- maybe a moderator can move it for you.)\n\n"
