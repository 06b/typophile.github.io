      "content": "Your current representation of the flame could be stronger. Also, if you’re not going to use it as the “i” you don’t need the dot above it. Have you tried making just the dot above the “i” a flame, instead of the whole figure? I’d just play around with other flame figures. The one you currently have is too squiggly for me.\n\nI think my favorite orientation of the text is your last one. It seems to flow the best. If you want to experiment with other fonts, you might try Helvetica Black. Although I don’t think the font you currently have needs to change. The only thing I think _has_ to go is the “1” (one). Its top extends too far to the left.\n\npenn\n\n"

Details like the target audience and the format (Top 40, Adult Contemporary, Alternative, Talk, etc.) are important to get a useful critique.\n\nIn addition to seeing an “i” I also saw the flame-like shape as also being praying figure. Not sure if that is intentional or not.\n\n"

      "content": "I would vote against the top one definitively. It looks too much like a generic top 40 radio station treatment.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the other treatments appear edgy or spiritual enough to appeal to a 20s-30s crowd. In my opinion most contemporary Christian music is fairly milquetoast and maintains to status quo. Your logo expresses that sense of mediocrity. I imagine that’s not what you’re going for. Have you looked at other logos for inspiration?\n\nAlso, critiquing the praying shape, it looks like the curves need some work, particularly on the right side. (It could just be the quality of the image you posted). Were there ever ideas that started on a piece of paper, or did you just start hacking away on the computer?\n\n—  \nNick Hladek\n\n"

      "content": "I don’t like that the style of the flame doesn’t match that of the letters. In all four versions the flame looks liquid and energetic while the letters are totally square. Maybe use a more roundish/energetic font type to convey a sense of energy and speed here?\n\n[Webdesign Hamburg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122112608/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n"
