Was there a reason you moved the star from the white field to the red, besides making room for the text?\n\nI don't know if the green I see on my monitor is the one that will be used in print, but what I see now does not contrast well with the red background... The green should be darker, perhaps.\n\nThe typeface (is it yours? it looks like the one from your recent t-shirt!) looks a bit too friendly for an anti-war message. I would use something that looks rougher, and that way avoid having to use bullet holes.\n\n"

It is readable enough but not comfortable to see (like the war).  \nYes, the typefaces are mine. The wider one is \"Fat Squeeze\"; the one with the bullet holes is \"Squeeze Trigger\"; the taller one at bottom is \"Tight Squeeze\"; and the light small caps are \"Now Sans Light.\"  \nI didn't want to be too grungy with the type. I wanted it to be more clinical. More like a bunch of fat-cat oil and defense mega-corporations silently profiting (getting fat) from the war.  \nIt is meant to be subtle and require some thought.

This is the effect I am after--take something out (foreign military forces) and give back the whole to the native Iraqis.

I think the poster works for both countries in terms of land being occupied or controlled by expatriates.\n\nI think \"We are the animals who are out of our habitat\" works best on the poster. Rather then green text on black, try white. This makes the middle the only part with green... just like the Iraqi flag.
