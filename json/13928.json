Die Gestalten has another face on their website called “Regular” which is a little less expensive, but similar to Blender. Gridnik seems to work surprisingly well for a text face. Phaidon has a series of pocket-sized photography books called “55” which uses Gridnik (I’m pretty sure it’s Gridnik anyway). Really nice little books.\n\n"
