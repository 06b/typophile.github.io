  "content": "Hi,  \nI am looking for typefaces with similar construction to the image attached. The image attached is Serge from Cyrus Highsmith. I am looking for sans serif (or serif as a plan B) typefaces that has similar exaggerated diagonals. So to be more clear I want the diagonal strokes to almost touch the baseline and this makes triangular counters. I would appreciate if you can recommend some options.  \nThanks.  \nalp\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416072421im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202013-12-17%20at%209_4481.49.36%20AM.png)\n\n",
