And not with fonts.  \nOn the internet there is an image where is written pumaville - motorstore find a store. I could write italia. The fonts of the numbers are not perfect.\n\nIs possible as well that he has access to the font for some reason.\n\nI hope that someone make these fonts avaible.\n\nOnizuka.\n\n"

In some way or another he got it maybe he produces T-Shirts or he is working for Dalton Maag. I can’t believe that nobody (a good designer) didn’t make a replica of that font.\n\nOnimiki.\n\n"

He is working for Dalton Maag Ltd.\n\nGiuseppe there is no way that he will make the font avaialble to the comunity. We are normal user he is a PRO!\n\nThe only way is that a capable person will make a replica font based on Puma Pace.\n\nI thought Vincenzo was a “normal user” but he is one of the best in the world.\n\nOnimiki.\n\np.s. is funny because the font file is a small file HA HA ;-) I’m sure it will be avaible in the future when it won’t be used anymore!\n\n"
