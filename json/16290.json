  "content": "Does anyone know anything about importing type and vector graphics into Avid for digital video? I'm helping a friend with titles for her documentary film, and we're having a heck of a time. Most of the type has been done in Avid directly, and it looks fine (we're using Quadraat and Neutra).\n\nThe problem is, the title itself is in both Hebrew and English, and I drew the Hebrew myself in Illustrator. We've tried importing the .ai file directly, but it endied up looking very bitmapped.\n\nI've brought the files into photoshop, both with and without anti-aliasing, and then I've added gaussian blurs of .5 to 2 pixels, but to no avail. It still looks bitmappy in Avid.\n\nCan anyone suggest anything?  \n(This is why I usually stick to print...)\n\nThanks so much.\n\n",
