The paths in FinishInstallWindows.cmd seem incorrect (I get errors). Even when I manually enter the correct paths, set the PATH etc., and re-login, the tools give python errors.\n\nSwitching to Fontlab macro style: There is no FDK/Tools/FontLab directory in the FDK tree, and there is no installFontLabMacros.py anywhere in the zip.\n\nDoes anyone know what the problem is? Did I get an incorrect zip somehow?\n\nBTW, I have Python 2.7.1 installed previously on my system (so I can already I run the occasional FontLab script)\n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\n",

I would like to have build 62690, but I cannot download it anymore. This is very annoying, because you have no access to a build, that works, and it makes it more difficult to precisely report bugs. Adobe should keep all versions, that are listed in the release notes, on the servers.\n\n"
