In the above example I would use the top one. Is that even correct though? Should _the_ be _The?_   \n   \nSpecifically, the one you see below is what brought this on.   \n   \nDesigned For the Collector   \n   \nWondering if it should be _Designed For The Collector_ has got my head in a spin.

      "content": "Sorry to sound like a nitpicky editor, but I must clear the CMoS name on a couple of points. It doesn't say to use double hyphens instead of em dashes. (It says that in a manuscript, that is a piece of writing being prepared for eventual typesetting and publication, double hyphens should stand in for em dashes, which will then be replaced by the typesetter.) And it calls for only one space to follow a sentence.   \n   \nTurabian really is for papers. CMoS is for scholars and other non-publishing-types to prepare their work for eventual publication, and for editors in publishing to prepare that work for typesetting. That's a pretty big distinction.   \n   \nAs someone who deals with both editorial and typographic matters, I tend to think it's possible to be picky about both without much conflict.\n\n"

      "content": "One advantage of the \"All Initials Capitalized\" style is that you don't get descenders on capitalized letters. Hence its poularity in the 1970's and 80's in hyper-tight, negative-leading ad headlines. And with word spaces reduced to less than zero, the capitalization served to differentiate words.   \n ![8Ways](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018212747im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19537.jpg)   \n   \nHowever, the disadvantage is that you also get the situation where the \"f\" of \"Of\" runs into the \"T\" of \"The\", bridging the space, especially in faces like Garamond. Not a problem in Palatino, though.   \n   \nThese are the kind of typographic factors that can influence the style decision, quite apart from the purely editorial.\n\n"

This is definitely true in publishing, less so in advertising.   \n   \nAs such, editorial style guides should be followed. There are valid arguments for various styles; the important thing is to determine a style and then apply it consistently. If you're working for a publishing client, you darn well better follow their editorial style. If not, then pick a style and stick with it.   \n   \nIn establishing an editorial style, most publishers will follow one of the two main style guides -- The Chicago Manual of Style, which began as merely the house style of the University of Chicago Press but later became popular for its thoroughness and widely adopted by most other publishers; and AP style, which is the style of the Associated Press and is widely used by newspapers, as well as some publishers.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
