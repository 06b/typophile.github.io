      "content": "Tim - Welcome to the forum. This is indeed fun and quirky and could have a lot of specialty uses.   \n   \nSome things that I think you can do right off the bat to make it work better...   \n   \nTry to bring the widths and weights closer together. When you test this with sample words and phrases, you might get a uneveness that you weren't intending.   \n   \nFor example, the bowl on lc 'q', the thin lc 'l', the thick uc 'F', when brought together might jar a bit. But maybe that's your intention.   \n   \nAs far as weights, the lc 'm' and lc 'h' seem exaggeratedly thin, the lc 'e' and 'u' seem a little fat.   \n   \nMy favorite letter is the lc 'g'. My least favorite are the lc 'u' and the uc 'U' -- I would look at the triangle shape that develops.   \n   \nThe best designers at nailing these kind of fonts: One Way Out. I don't have the link, but if you go to MacSurfShop.com, I think you can find a link there. They used to distribute through t26 and now they sell mostly to religious organizations.   \n   \nOne Way Out fonts are quirky, but magically delicious.   \n   \ngood luck   \n   \nbj\n\n"
