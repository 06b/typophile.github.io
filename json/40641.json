  "content": " This is from a book printed in the mid ’60s, on a typesetting machine that allowed for ligatures (I’ve seen some ‘ﬃ’s) but not kerning—even the italic is unkerned. My scanner doesn’t work under Linux, so I have a photo; if higher quality is needed for an ID I’ll scan it again.  \n Some features of the font I’ve noticed:  \n• The leg of the `Q' begins on the bottom-outside of the circle.  \n• Quotes & apostrophes are smaller than the commas.  \n• Four-headed `W' with separate serifs.  \n• The left leg of the `M' is slightly slanted, the right leg is straight.  \n• The square brackets `[]' have curved tops & bottoms and little something-or-others on their sides.  \n I'll try whatthefont again after I get a high-quality scan; right now it's just suggesting distressed fonts.  \n—Joel\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414231912im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Just_in_Time_6690.png)\n\n",
