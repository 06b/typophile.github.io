  "content": "This is a logo i have created for an advertising company but the main objective of the company is web design & graphic design. The company has only two members and they are the 2 brothers. They`r goal is to attract large and important clients so i thought that something simple, stable and powerful would do the trick. Do you agree? If not, any better ideas? :D\n\nP.S. i had real trouble coming up with an icon illustrating two brothers. Can anyone help with this, too? Thanks a lot \\<):)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020025022im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Marosi%20bros_3708.%20logo%206.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I didn't even notice the \"brothers\" in the logo at first. It's much too understated in comparison to \"marosi\". I'd either remove it or make it more prominent.\n\nThe use of \"image\" as a verb is very unusual. Did you do this on purpose?\n\nThe typeface choice doesn't say simple, stable, and powerful to me. It says hair salon from the 1980s. Don't take my advice as gospel, but I'd change the typeface to something a little tamer like Avenir.\n\nThe burgundy and grey colour scheme is nice (although those were my high school's colours, so I'm a bit biased). I'd keep it.\n\nYou might want to think a little more abstractly in the case of an icon. Maybe instead of representing \"two brothers\", you should simply think about representing \"two\".\n\n- Lex\n\n"

It just doesn’t work for for a design firm.\n\nI like the look, but only if the word “brothers” goes and the rule slides right in under “marosi”.\n\n"

I recommend a contemporary rendition of Bauhaus with present-day chic--- [Amity](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020025022/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/amity/).\n\nThis logo will be effective without the tagline, but if the client really wants a tagline try to steer them away from \"we image you\". That's a bit lame and self-conscious. I've come up with an alternative, \"image by design\", but I bet somebody else is already using it.\n\nAlso recommend using a more contemporary color.
