  "content": "Hi guys!\n\nI’ve actually already got an identity ( [http://www.typophile.com/node/27464](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203110553/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27464 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/27464\") )  \nbut I’m not happy with the name “bloobseven” since a lot of people and clients ask me what it stands for.. and it doesn’t really stand for anything but is rather a “back-in-the-day-.com-hype” name.\n\nSo I’ve decided to make it more personal and switch to my name “michael nagy” I’ve already sketched a few ideas\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203110553im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/3_4861.png)\n and after a lil bit of doodling I came up with this idea \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203110553im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/4_6147.png)\n  \nThe M,N and G form the pencil. MN stands for my name “Michael Nagy” and the G stands for “Grafiker” which is german for graphic designer.  \nHowever. In the cleaned up versions a lot of people read ECO insted of mng. Any ideas on how to make it more legible?  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203110553im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/1_3529.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203110553im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/2_6216.png)\n\nThe font for the name is Myriad Pro. Is this a good solution in your opinion? I like Myriad cause it’s versatile and not overused but I’d gladly take any typo suggestions into consideration.\n\n [‹ Carpenter Company Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203110553/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42368 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo for help desk application ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203110553/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42413 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I think the reason people are seeing “ECO” is that the letters are stacked vertically. I’d try something horizontal instead.\n\nAs for Myriad, I see it used everywhere, simply because it’s the default typeface in Photoshop and Illustrator. It still looks nice though. You might want to either go with a typeface closer to the letters you’ve drawn in the pencil shape, or make the letters in the pencil look closer to the typeface used for your name.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

If that’s your symbol, you should probably try something like Neo Sans for the name.\n\nBut isn’t a pencil a rather too obvious solution anyway? I much rather preferred the initial typographic options. The last two of the first set looked quite stylish.\n\n"

You make your statement by the refinement you bring to that simplicity - fine typography, exquisite spaces, restrained use of colours...\n\nIn fact a sort of neutrality in your own identity is often a good thing. You’re saying you don’t have a particular style, you can design whatever your client’s brief requires you to.\n\n"

What do you think of the balance between the initials and the text? I’m wondering if the space between the ’n’ initial and “Nagy” could be negotiated a little better.\n\nFor e, I immediately thought “a bent paperclip,” which is really neat. The paperclip is a good concept to work off of, because it’s such a banal object, yet at the same time you would really notice if it were not designed well!\n\n"
