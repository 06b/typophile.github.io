What is worth the price to one may not be to another - regardless of the quality of the product. House fonts, too, are surely beyond the means of lots of even professionals.\n\nIf someone does not specifically require specific House fonts, then why in the world would they _not_ seek out similar, less expensive alternatives? It just seems so judgemental (even snobbish) to me.\n\nJan, there was no logic at all in your question.\n\nGeorge - First of all, your assumption that the House fonts are not original designs is false. As such, any alternatives would only be similar, not the same. Also, it rather discourages suggestions from us when we couldn't possibly have a clue as to what fonts you have on hand.\n\nSo , with no thought as to what you _might_ have available already, here are two suggestions:\n\nFor House Holiday Gothic, see what you think of Larabie's [Mikadan](http://web.archive.org/web/20100511215044/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/mikadan/) - a combination of two typefaces from the early 1900's.\n\nFor House Holiday Script, see the thin scripts in some of [Stuart Sandler's](http://web.archive.org/web/20100511215044/http:/www.fontdiner.com/main.html) various inexpensive packages.\n\nI know of nothing quite like House Holiday Sans.\n\n"

I don't ask someone else to do that for me.\n\n"
