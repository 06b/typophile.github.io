  "content": "On April 16th 2005, a project **[Diacritics](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013200232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Diacritics%20Project)** was introduced to attendants of a conference [Typo.Graphic.Beirut](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013200232/http:/typographicbeirut.lau.edu.lb/) by Filip Blažek. The aim of this project is to build a free on-line database of knowledge and experience -- how to design correct diacritics: what size, shape and position an accent should have. Text concerning the history, use, languages and also some technical information is related to each diacritical mark. The project web site is based on wiki: after a simple registration, anyone can append or correct any published text or upload pictures. There is no need for special knowledge of HTML code, the editing is also similar to Wikipedia.\n\nThe project (in English only) is on-line at [**diacritics.typo.cz**](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013200232/http:/diacritics.typo.cz/).\n\nContributions are welcome.\n\n",
