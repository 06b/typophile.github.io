  "content": "Hi There   \n   \nWe are working on a new website for Union Fonts, which we expect to go live in early March. We feel that it is important to get as many opinions about what we are doing as possible. So I hope some of you can spare the time to advise me on a few questions...   \n   \nDo you think that a flash based Typesampler is an important way to test a font before you buy?   \n   \nWe are also offering desigenrs who sell through us 50% of the sale price, does this seem reasonable compared to other type site you deal with?   \n   \nWe are also going to give the designer of the top selling font in 2004 (on Union) �1000, that roughly $2000 is that something which could make us a more appealing?   \n   \nThanks for your help!   \n   \nDALE\n\n",

My own feeling is that -unless it's a bitmap font- you should give away high-quality renderings, and hope it creates a dependency (= sales) in users. Anything else is too protectionist in this hyper-competitive type design scene.   \n   \nYes, 50% is good - if you take on some promotional costs.   \n   \nTop-seller prize: be careful, that might cause people to make _fewer_ fonts.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

In 'this hyper-competitive type design scene', the days when vendors could collect a substantial percentage just for reselling a font is over. Frankly, I wouldn't be inclined to let any reseller take more than 40%, and I would want to see copies of every marketing piece they produced to make sure that they were doing a good job and not just using my typeface to pad their library. There are a lot of font resellers now, and the Internet has largely levelled the playing field: foundries and individual designers can afford to be picky and demand that the resellers be competetive.\n\n"

You want prestige? Buy your fonts directly from the people who make them. What resellers like MyFonts, Union, etc. offer is not prestige but convenience.   \n   \nI greatly admire the way Jeremy Tankard handles resellers: he offers them a small percentage (usually less than 20%) and he demands results. If they don't adequately market his fonts, he reduces the percentage. If they don't sell enough, he cancels the contract. How can he do this? Because his 'little foundry' has established a prestigious reputation through the quality of his work and very active marketing.\n\n"

For that number a designer such as myself would want lots of marketing going out, especially printed.   \n   \nLay out all of the type showings the same way, like font bureau. If you want to show the font in use, design posters or other material to show them off on the site. Or even collect samples of the type in use and put those up there.   \n   \nPDF showings are a nice feature to have.   \n   \nFlash typesetters are cool, but I don't use them much.   \n   \nDefinitely go for quality fonts over quantity. A good selection of average fonts will bring some people to the site. Unique designs will draw more traffic and sell better in the long run.   \n   \nThe bonus incentive is very appealing. I'm considering submitting fonts to the Bitstream New Font Collection, they give you the option for $2000 immediately or a royalty plan. That's a nice way to make a quick 2 Gs.\n\n"

      "content": "From the perspective of a purchaser/ user, rather than creator, of fonts, I have a few general 'shopping experience' preferences and pet peeves:   \n   \n- Printable samples (PDFs): The impact of printed samples, showing the font actually in use (along with blown up, with ligatures, etc.) is much greater for convincing the people who provide the $$ (client and/or me). Like Randy, I find this is particularly true of text faces.   \n   \n- Flash preview sampler: For logotypes, I really like having this kind of tool available. It definitely helps my purchasing decisions. And while I understand that some people screenshot the type without paying, making it harder to do that by using weird patterns (as Hoefler does), or not offering the feature at all isn't going to get them to buy your fonts anyway. Plus, you can zoom in with Flash and see the juicy little details.   \n   \n- On-screen samples: Images of type in use, even if it's short strings of words, like FB does. I find these much more telling than \"Meta Book Roman\" set in Meta Book Roman, or a character chart (not that I don't want to see one of those as well). For quick browsing, (like you have on your site) I don't mind, but I like having them available to look more thoroughly.   \n   \n- Please don't hide the price: I don't mean put it on the first page per se, but don't make it tedious to access. I understand that there are different prices for different situations, but a single-user license price gives a good sense of price scale.   \n   \nI've been to the current Union Fonts site, so I know that a lot of this isn't news to you, and that some of these features are already in place. Consider this my plea on their behalf. I look forward to seeing what you guys do.\n\n"

      "content": "_\\>Font Bureau, at $40 per weight, is nearly double the $21 of many at MyFonts._   \n   \nYes, Font Bureau fonts are a little more costly than the average these days; I personally believe you get appropriate value for the additional cost.   \n   \nI would like to point out that the FB pricing structure is volume-based. The $40 price so often cited is only if you buy only one or two styles at a time. When you buy three styles, the per font price goes down to $35. If you purchase six or more, the price drops further to $30 each. These are the most significant break points; there are others as you increase the volume further.   \n   \nThis is, unfortunately, not immediately apparent from their website. To see the structure spelled out more clearly, go to [www.fontbureau.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050816164413/http:/www.fontbureau.com/) and click on the little Help icon in the lower right hand corner of the front page. From the new Help window, select the topic \"Font Pricing\" from the list on the right.   \n   \nSo, when it comes to buying a family of FB fonts (which is really the better way to go about it) the price quickly comes down to a more reasonable territory -- never cheap, I admit, but reasonable.   \n   \nNote that these volumes apply regardless of whether the fonts are in the same family or not -- a unique circumstance, as far as I know. So you can buy just a handful of styles of Miller, for instance, and maybe a few weights of Interstate, and throw in Mantinia, and put together your own package for $30 each. That's not too bad, when you think about it. (Well, when \\*I\\* think about it, anyway.)   \n   \nJust felt compelled to clarify.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"
