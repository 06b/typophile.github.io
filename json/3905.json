This sample is from the Australian 'Donna Hay Magazine', but I think that 'Real Simple' magazine also uses it.   \n   \nAny help would be most appreciated...   \nThank you!   \n   \nHelen\n\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; What is this font? - Peignot &#40;slanted&#41; {Hrant}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203172411/http:/www.typophile.com/node/3907 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#40;x&#41; Excellent communication - Adobe Sans {Yves} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203172411/http:/www.typophile.com/node/3892 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

And both typefaces were designed according to the same principle of the broad-nibbed pen.   \n   \nYou can find more info about the genesis of Thesis at [Lucasfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203172411/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/) \\> The LF Font Families \\> Thesis Classic \\> Info & Samples. The most interesting part of the creation, it's original design under the name Parenthesis as the \"corporate\" typeface for the ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat, is not included anymore, sadly enough.\n\n"

Perhaps Luc(as) was looking over his shoulder in class? Or was it the other way round? ;) The actual type [family](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203172411/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_235.jhtml) was designed in 1990 and named for his wife.
