A sans-serif face which is I think is difficult read in a book and the printing job is poor.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153122im_/http:/typophile.com/files/type1_1_4553.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153122im_/http:/typophile.com/files/type1_2_6734.jpg)\n  \n.\n\nThe second one, printed in 1931.

I think the 'a' looks most like the Ludlow version, where the serif curls back a bit more than the Linotype or Monotype versions. We are talking about metal type, and I know there were Bodonis from every foundry, so this part will be based more on what samples we can find of metal type showings, but are you more interested in a digital Bodoni that seems close than in finding out what metal typeface was used?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

There are even some stains here and there on some pages and the letters are jumping up and down. The typeface doesn't work in that context (Bible) and is a nuisance to read in big chunks. I paid a lot for this Bible, it's a rare piece and an old translation that isn't sold in Finland anymore.\n\nThe second Bible (even older edition and translation) is far nicer to read and the printing job is clean, but — being a web designer and all — I have no experience of identifying or judging print typography (the ink spread especially is foreign to me).\n\nAnyway, I'm surprised that it's Bodoni in the second example. It looks tremendously different from the Bodonis I've used to seeing on-screen.\n\nThanks for the info though, it was very interesting and useful to know.\n\n"

      "content": "Well, to me the most un-Bodoni part of it is how dark it looks, like a medium or almost bold weight. The contrast is less than you expect to see. For ID purposes I would like to see certain other letters, like b, C, W and Q if they show up in Finnish. Those letters could confirm whether Bodoni was used. I think my [Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153122/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php) could help identify this with a few more Key letters. The closest font I get using it right now is [Berthold Augustea](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153122/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_a/augustea_full.gif), which shares a lot of the Bodoni letterforms, so I admit I am at a loss.\n\nDo you think Augustea looks closer? It was designed in the early 1900's, so it should have been available.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

And no, there isn't C, W or Q in native Finnish words, and although they're in our alphabet, I doubt they will be found in the Bible (how many names beginning with Q or W do you remember from e.g. Hebrew?).\n\n<cite>Well, to me the most un-Bodoni part of it is how dark it looks, like a medium or almost bold weight.</cite>\n\nThat's exatcly what surprised me. The high contrast there on the paper is nothing like the hair-thin lines onscreen. The contrast is more like that of Baskerville's to me.\n\nBut I've always been under the impression that the effects of ink spread has been \"added\" to the typefaces when they were ditigized. That's why the digitized Centaur looks so thin and suffering, because the design was based on metal type and not how it looks on paper.\n\n"

If it has a straight stem, then that rules out most Bodonis, which have a horizontal serif at the baseline. The other clue would be the G, which is cut off in your sample. If it has a 'beard', then it is not Bodoni.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
