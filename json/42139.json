  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nSomeone has asked me if Wexford (see attached sample from the Bauhaus Guide) has ever been digitized. That sample was shown in the 1985 Phil's Photo \"Homage to the Alphabet\" book. Apparently it was used back in 1981 for a company logo that they want to update with the same typeface, if possible. I did a number of Google searches, and only found an unrelated font and a couple of non-vendor links. I'm wondering if OptiFonts ever digitized it, or if an amateur version exists under another name?\n\nThanks for any help you can provide.\n\n- Mike\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141228194147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WexfordXB_5725.gif)\n\n",

However, I couldn't find any information regarding purchasing/downloading these beauties. Perhaps another member can shed some light on this?\n\n"

I have just sent an e-mail to find out more about how fonts can be purchased/downloaded. One of the purposes of that site according to Shinya is to be a reference guide for some of the obscure fonts. Apparently he/she is also digitizing some of them to revive the designs.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
