  "content": "Hello, I am looking for an alternative to Acid by Stephen Baum. I realize it is an incomplete work in progress and I'd really like access to more glyphs.\n\nI really like how this type has a clean, scientific almost medicinal, sterile feel to it. I like how it is very geometric as well. Please if anyone has any alternatives to this typeface it would be awesome if you could share.\n\nExtra credit if you can find me one with a web-font alternate as well.\n\nYou can find Acid here:\n\n[http://26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/acid-type/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031930/http:/26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/acid-type/ \"http://26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/acid-type/\")\n\nThanks for the help!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031930im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fonts-148_6058.jpg)\n\n",
