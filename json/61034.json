Set Trajan against an number of sans serif fonts of your choosing and pick the one you like the best. It really is as simple as that.\n\nWhy do people even post these \"what goes with what\" threads?

The whole point of being a typographer is to develop your own sense of style. Your own sense of \"what goes with what\". It may take a bit of hard work, and it may take some time, but ultimately it is a personal decision, and no amount of internet inquiry is going to give you a real leg up. Hence my response. And ultimately, who give a crap about pen construction or any other theory anyway. Back to the Duke.\n\n"

Font choices aren't variables to be solved on their own, easily isolated from the total equation that is good design (partly because the latter is actually more than the sum of its parts).  \nI'm sure there are about ten thousand sans serifs that could be paired with Trajan, and without talking about (a) what that font in question needs to be able to do, exactly, nor (b) what it should communicate and (c) how and (d) two whom, and (e) if it needs to harmonize or contrast with the existing font, to create a hint of tension and be a little bitchy or to sing with it and be beautiful, – and of course (f) what the overall concept & other known factors/constituents of the design in question are, – without all that discussion, it doesn't make all that much sense to look for / suggest fonts that, on the surface, share – what? _pen construction?_ :-\\\n\nThe beauty of typography and design is the search for the right combination of the right ingredients for all of it to click together. And pen construction isn't gonna be The Easy Formula That Provides A Clickin' Experience Every Time. Nor is anything else for that matter.  \nStop trying to do what you think is the correct way to do it, and start playing.\n\n"

Of course you are free to try everything in between and beyond.\n\nFurthermore by suggesting directions or groups rather than concrete typefaces, you have a much bigger learning effect and need to figure out your own way in selecting typefaces – to \"develop your own sense of style. Your own sense of ‘what goes with what’\".\n\n"

The caps for Linea are interesting (like the B) but didn't see the lowercase on the reffered page.

Because we are considering a sans serif companion to Trajan, I would assume that Trajan is being used for titling and the sans serif for the body text, prelims etc.\n\n@Andreas. As you know, Roman letters are very geometric as well as Futura. Roman letters are suggestive of or made up of Circles, Squares and Triangles. However Futura is not as geometric as originally thought the more you look at it in detail. That is why there is a nice balance between the two - they sort of meet half way.\n\n"
