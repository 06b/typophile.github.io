  "content": "I have a question concerning which ascender height I should use in Fontlab when making Type1-fonts. The manual says you should add some to the \"typographic\" ascender to make the fonts ascender. But what about the Opentype dialog, does it make any difference to the leading? Should I care at all about that dialog when making Type 1?\n\n",
