Its called MARKER ACCT.AK.REV.D and is included in a Gerber Scientific Products stencil plotter/cutter, but the font is nowhere else to be found. I can use something close, but that has turned useless as well.\n\nThanks a ton!\n\nScott\n\n[afterburnerdecals@gmail.com](mailto:afterburnerdecals@gmail.com)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623045053im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RR_4608.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623045053im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Marker_6396.jpg)\n\n",

Apply a little customizing of the terminals to make the look unified, and voilá.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I know of three digital versions, but the most readily available would be Nick Curtis's [Duly Noted](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623045053/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/duly-noted-nf/).\n\nOh, and I want to add a definite confirmation that the other font is, as Marcelo stated (and ought to get credit for) Silver Graphics' 'Sanford'.\n\n"
