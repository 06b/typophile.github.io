He seems reluctant to allow anyone else to access his fonts as he can sometimes spend weeks developing them for specific projects.   \n   \nThanks again,   \n   \nKarl\"   \n   \nSometimes it helps to just ask... ;)\n\n"

Thank you very much for the kind remarks about the dezap typeface, which I simply call 'dezap'.   \n   \nThere are currently just 3 different weights (light, regular, bold). The one used for the logotype is the 'regular' weight and the rest of the website uses the 'light' weight.   \n   \nI created the 5 original d-e-z-a-p characters as a standalone logotype to enable the logo to be reversible through 180 degrees, and then it eventually evolved into a full family which is now used across the company branding.   \n   \nCertainly, the simplicity of Hans Reichel's 'Dax' typeface was something I had in mind when designing this font, but I hope 'dezap' can be evaluated on its own merits.   \n   \nOn a small side note, the photograph that has been posted on the Typophile forum is from our website. It is of a sign that hangs on the studio wall. I would usually insist that the logotype reads from top to bottom (or bottom to top), rather that left to right. The viewer then has to tilt their head and physically 'interact' with the logo in order to read it ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20070317223321im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nThanks again!   \n   \n   \nNEIL ROBINSON   \ndezap\n\n"
