However, it can't look too sophisticated - good value for your buck kind of feel.\n\nI need help finding a display and body face.\n\nFor the display, I like:  \nSerifa  \nInterstate  \nFoundry Form  \nCeacilia  \nRockwell\n\nand text:  \nBodoni  \nMyriad  \nTheSans\n\nWhat do you think? Serifa with Myriad and The Sans? What about Bodoni?\n\nPav\n\n",

There are some slabs that read quite nicely (if maybe not for entire books). Caecilia is a pretty nice one (although its x-height really is a bit large).\n\n"
