Just wondering: Did the club consider identity for 'atmosphere'? An 'atmosphere' logo might be considered.   \n   \nOverall, I like that we are getting to see design projects and designers posting their work.   \n   \nLooking forward to seeing your site. ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417075208im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nbj\n\n"
