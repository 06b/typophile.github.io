For my comments i'm assuming it's a standard face for text.\n\nwow! i didn't even read dan's comments till after i looked at the face and his comments are the same as what mine would have been. just a couple more things:\n\n_The bottom right of the b feels uncomfortable._  \nsame goes for the top left of the bowl of the g (as i'm suspected it's the same piece, only rotated)  \nthe inner counter of the o seems a bit too boxy. maybe smooth out the curves at 1 and 7 o'clock.  \nthe bowl on the a could be a bit more angular/contrasty to match the other curved elements. and to solve the a's terminal problem, you might just make it a bit heavier on the end.  \nis that m a doubled n? even if not, it seems a bit too wide still.  \ni think that poor little s feels very uncomfortable. try to make it less disjointed.  \nlooking at the pdf:  \nall the terminals look a bit hesitant (they go out with a whimper instead of a bang) i'm talking about a,f,g,j & y.  \nthe w has the same crotch problem as the v, as does the y.  \nThe caps are very nice. Terminal problem on J. The stroke on the Q looks like it's not sure it should be there. Are those ink traps on the A, M, N, V, W (and v, w, y) if so i think they need to be re-thought so as to give more weight to the crotches (as dan stated before). The C seems a bit squonched, but i'm not sure exactly to suggest to fix that. The S and the Z seem to be leaning to the left. There should be more difference between the bowls on the P and the R.  \nMy preference is for slightly longer descenders, but that could be just my personal preference.  \nThe figures seem a bit small. i think taking the height up between the x-height and the cap height they'd look better. If you decided to make the descenders longer this would help the numerals, IMO.\n\nAnd as with all critiques by yours truly, a disclaimer: I am no expert, all advice is my own personal opinions and does not reflect the views of typophile and is to be taken with a healthy dose of salt. use this information at your own risk. i refuse to be liable for consequences caused by the adherence to suggestions or the lack thereof.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Paul,\n\nThankyou very much for taking the time to look at my typeface and for your detailed suggestions. They are very helpful. Apologies for my delayed reply: it is early Sunday morning here in Melbourne.\n\nOmnium is intended for reasonably extended setting in magazines and books. I think it has probably ended up with too much personality for serious continuous setting.\n\nI have been steadily rounding the counters from what started out as a much more extreme typeface. I’d like to remove some of that boxy discomfort without losing too much of the angularity in the counters which gives the typeface much of its personality. As you suggest, only some of the counters are problematic.\n\nI’ll give some more presence to the terminals and the crotches and deal with soften the more awkward curves. I prized the crotches apart (so to speak) in order to achieve even colour -- probably at the expense of the strength in some of the intersections. I suppose I can keep the ink traps to some extent. They just need to be more subtle.\n\nYou guessed correctly on the doubled-n m. A trap for young players, I guess.\n\nMy intention with the old style numerals is to find a size which works well within text with lowercase but which also works with longer strings of numerals in their own right. I find that the height of old style numerals often jumps about too much with certain combinations like 345 688 120 (see [http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/num\\_demo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101251/http:/omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/num_demo.jpg \"http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/num\\_demo.jpg\") ).\n\nWhen you suggest taking the height of the numerals up, do you suggest increasing all numerals or making the ascenders ascend more and the descenders descend more? I guess I’ll try some options and see what works. I also intend to develop a cap-height lining set.\n\nHi Oribendor,\n\nThanks very much for your words of encouragement. The type design scene here in Melbourne is small but I’ve had plenty of advice from local typographers and type designers with more experience than myself. I have spent quite a lot of time looking at Dutch typefaces and I think a lot can be learned from sites like this one!\n\nAs you guessed, I sketched the letters first and as Andreas suggested, the curves are made up of broken forms which I am trying to reconcile into flowing curves. I’ve attached a sample of the kinds of drawings upon which my letterforms are based: [http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium\\_drawing.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101251/http:/omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium_drawing.jpg \"http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium\\_drawing.jpg\")\n\nHi Andreas,\n\nSorry you haven’t been to access the PDF.

In case somebody (more like virtually everybody) doesn't know, a metagram is a fancy pangram that lets you evaluate a font much better:  \n [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=2454](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101251/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=2454 \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=2454\")\n\nAnyway, onto this quite interesting font...\n\nFirst of all, the PDF is much more convincing than that GIF up top, so I'm glad you've made that available. This face has quite enviable poise. And I don't agree that \"it has probably ended up with too much personality\" to serve as a text face; as Schwartz's Houston Chronicle effort has hopefully proven, the text face envelope still has huge room for expansion, although in a direction seldom explored. That said, I think this still needs a lot of work to become adequate.\n\nMy foremost \"macro\" critique is that the color is a bit light for the vertical proportions, which seem ideal for around 8 point setting. If that's too small a point size in terms of your target, I'd increase the ascenders a bit, shooting for 9 point; but I might still increase the color slightly. If you like shooting for 8 point, I would pull in the descenders a hair.\n\nMicro stuff:  \n\"a\": It needs to be happier - it's a very important character. I don't think the terminal of the top is the problem (it's certainly better than the one in the \"g\") but probably that the top of the bowl shouldn't be so horizontal - try tilting it gently.  \n\"f\": Could use a stronger beak.  \n\"g\": Give its terminal a serif, like in the \"c\". Or much better: make a binocular one... with an open bottom. But if you keep it mono, give it a nice rising ear.  \n\"j\": That chirographic terminal seems to actually work here.  \n\"k\": Best glyph so far!  \n\"p\": Bottom of the bowl too heavy.  \n\"q\": depending on what you do with the \"g\", consider a pointy ear.  \n\"r\": Majorly needs a powerful beak.  \n\"s\": At first I thought it was too \"coiled up\", but now I think it's da bomb.  \n\"v\", \"w\": Too much separation at the diagonal joins.  \n\"y\": As in the \"j\", the terminal works here.  \n\"B\": Slightly too wide.  \n\"C\": A bit too narrow.  \n\"E\": A bit too wide.  \n\"F\": I'd lower the bar.  \n\"G\": Slightly too narrow.  \n\"J\": Tail not working at all. Maybe descend it (if you end up descending the \"Q\").  \n\"K\": Nice, but a bit wide.  \n\"M\": Too wide.  \n\"P\": Slightly larger head.  \n\"Q\": Tail not working, especially inside. Not descend it?  \n\"U\": A bit too narrow.  \n\"V\", \"W\": Same problem as in the lc.\n\nNumerals:  \nI can only recommend what I so often do for text faces: hybrid numerals! Actually not far from what you already have, but taller than the lc x-height in body.\n\nAll in all, great stuff - please keep it up!\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Hrant.\n\nThankyou for your detailed critique and words of encouragement: lots of things for me to think about.\n\nIn terms of proportion and colour I think I have been too vague in stating my goals – sorry. Rather than 8 or 9pt regular, this typeface should probably be seen as a semi-light for setting at 10pt. I intend to create a regular, semi bold and bold in the future. I started with the lightest weight because I’m told that this is the most difficult to establish in terms of curves and stroke variation.\n\nTherefore, as at 10pt semi-light, I imagine I should increase my ascenders somewhat and maintain the same level of colour? Further down the track, I’d like to create a caption cut with reduced extenders for setting at smaller sizes.\n\nThe colour of Omnium has simmered down during the testing process. I’m aiming to find the smallest amount of stroke variation which still conveys its rotated humanist axis at 10pt (with laser output.)\n\nWith regards to proportions, a small preliminary comparative analysis I did may be of interest:\n\nBefore I started drawing Omnium, I made a rough analysis of a bunch of typefaces in terms of proportion and colour, making measurements and comparing them as percentages of each typeface’s x-height (which I believe to be the most useful benchmark in terms of comparison). I measured ascender and descender lengths, maximum stroke thickness (typically the stem of the lc d), minimum stroke thickness (crossbar on the lc e). I divided min stroke thickness by max stroke thickness to give me a crude measurement for comparing the variation stroke thickness. To measure how condensed each typeface was, I measured the widths of lc d, e and o. I also measured the axis of stroke variation for each. A table of data can be viewed here:\n\n[http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium\\_decon.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101251/http:/omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium_decon.pdf \"http://omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/omnium\\_decon.pdf\")\n\nNumerals:  \nYes. I am very keen on the idea of hybrid numerals: not to replace the lining numerals, but to replace the old style ones. I’ll explore some possibilities.\n\nThanks again for your advice.

But I'd rather see the design of the Regular done first, simply because that'll be used most. Note that basing things on an extreme weight can skew the Regular in peculiar ways: potentially interesting for display, generally bad for text. On the other hand, you're not really far from what I personally would like to see as the Regular weight of this design (a bit darker) so I don't think you'll have any such problems.\n\n\\> [http://danmilne.fastmail.fm/omnium\\_decon.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101251/http:/danmilne.fastmail.fm/omnium_decon.pdf \"http://danmilne.fastmail.fm/omnium\\_decon.pdf\")\n\nCool.\n\nhhp\n\n"

It was always my intention to create a family of hybrids: to push the serif and sanserif designs as close together as possible… to make a serif which takes proportions and geometry from sanserifs without losing too many of the serif features which help readability: the humanist axis, the stroke variation and, of course, the serifs.\n\nIn the same way, I’d like to keep as much of this humanist readability in the sanserif as is possible without straying too far from what is considered a classic sanserif. So I’ve been waiting to stabilise the design of the serif before (gleefully) amputating the serifs, reducing stroke variation and making other necessary adjustments.\n\nSo I'm not really deriving a sanserif from my serif. I like to think of them as twins who have grown up together :-)\n\nI started with more variation in stroke thickness in the serif, but the boxy, angular counters were looking very awkward and I was forced to retreat.\n\nIf my serif appears to be too much of a ‘sanserif with serifs’, how do you suggest I improve it without increasing the stroke variation?

The shapes are a bit softer and more cursive overall. I have also streamlined and simplified terminals on the curved extenders and added more curve to the tail of the ‘f’.\n\nI have made ranging default numerals as well as a lining set to go with the (hopefully seldom-used) small caps. I have also loosened the spacing slightly. Do you think the spacing is ok?\n\nHi Eduardo,\n\nThanks for your advice once again. I agree with you that [Omnium Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101251/http:/typophile.com/node/14805) needs some work. It is clearly derivative of the serif and I think that as an individual typeface it struggles. As a supporting face for the serif it seems quite suitable, but I would like to see it rise above this level. I will turn my hand to it over the next few days.\n\nHi Hrant,\n\nFirstly, thank you for your consistent, constructive advice. The design of Omnium owes you much! It is amazing how much difference the tweaking of an ‘s’ can make to the personality of a typeface. I explored the idea of the Dwiggins narrow-topped ‘a’, but I couldn’t make it work so I opted for a compromise in-between and adapted all the bowled characters.\n\nCheers,\n\nDan\n\n"

I was introduced to it after I did my first drawings for Omnium. It gave me confidence to keep the serifs long and unbracketed. I have just looked at it again and I think there might be some ideas there which will help me improve my italic.\n\nI wasn’t aware of Apollo, but I just checked it out and it looks like Frutiger had similar goals with his long baseline serifs and his very oblique axis of stroke variation.\n\nI drew my characters by hand and then in Illustrator before taking them into Fontlab. In retrospect, I should have taken them straight from hand drawings into Fontlab because it is so much more precise than illustrator and much easier to test your letters as you draw them.\n\nSo far I’ve only made alternates for ‘Q’ and ‘J’. I originally planned to keep all my caps above the baseline, but I was never really happy with my ‘Q’ and the above-the-line ‘J’ makes spacing difficult so I developed [these.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101251/http:/omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/Omnium_Alt_ligs_230.gif)\n\nDo you have some suggestions for other alternates?\n\nMy f-ligatures are simply joined at the crossbar, so I’ve used context dependent substitutions to substitute a single long crossbar’d ‘f’ with the existing I such that the letter combinations can be tracked freely… As opposed to stiff ligatures. If that makes sense…\n\nDan\n\n"

Changes sometimes only scramble the code that is known for so many... therefore I think that the choice to draw the 'Q' and the 'J' below the baseline is \"typographically correct\". Although we look for changes in order to distinguish \"our\" drawings from others, is it also known that only the very careful and microscopic eye can distinguish the novelties. It has to be banal enough for you to read without changing speed and recognition, but somehow leaves a perfume of a personality that gives it taste.\n\nAs for alternates, in roman type, the 'c's and the 't's can always fall is love, just like de 's's and 'c's, and the 's's and 't's. My advice is for you to look at the forms Slimbach made in Adobe Garamond, which drinks from Griffo's work in the Renaissance. But what I believe to be more interesting is the personality of the italic letter. There's a wonderful study in the work, also by Slimbach - Poetica. I had the honour of exploring this family on a small book on Old Music, through the combination of alternates, small caps, swash capitals and the chanceries, working aside with Bembo.  \nWe should always learn from old ways. (Mrs Eaves by Licko shows that particular interest).\n\nYour typeface Omnium, in particular seems a challenge for exploring such a feature. I liked very much because it reminds me of the faces I have referred, but it has a touch of the geometric modernism that makes it interesting.\n\nI don´t know how valid you might think my critics are, since I haven´t drawn a typeface so far. I just a guy who loves letters and history and art, and the way that they interact.\n\nAs I have said before, keep up the good work ;) and keep me posted. I'd like to see the evolution.\n\n"

      "content": "Ligatures can have two roles: _style_ and _function._ ‘s\\_t’ and ‘s\\_c’ ligatures are examples of the former; ‘f\\_f\\_l’ is an example of the latter. As a typeface designed for magazines and books, Omnium concerns itself only with functional ligatures which solve spacing problems. The ‘s\\_t’ ligature is beautiful, but unnecessary and can be seen as a distraction in immersive reading. Omnium’s ‘f\\_f\\_l’ ligature is almost entirely at the function end of the scale. It solves the problem of the undesirably close ‘f’ and ‘l’, adjusting the character shapes slightly to allow comfortable spacing. Rather than taking a purely functional approach to the f\\_f combination, I chose to unite, rather than shorten, the crossbar between the two. Perhaps a shortening of the offending crossbars (hence avoiding any binding of the letters) would have been a more ‘invisible’ solution, however the long crossbar seemed more in tune with my goal of horizontal emphasis. And can a ligature still be called a ligature if it does not bind, but serves only to space?\n\nI hope that, in avoiding distractive ligatures, Omnium is not considered bland.\n\nFor similar reasons, I have replaced the original non-descending ‘Q’ with a more standard and predictable design. However, I have kept the original non-descending ‘Q’ as an alternate for the odd occasion when someone might like to set a heading in caps without descenders, perhaps with a rule below.\n\nI am pleased that Omnium reminds you of Garamond and Griffo. In fact, the name _Omnium_ comes from that much referred-to [page from Jenson in _De Evangelica Preraratione,_ Venice, 1469.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101251/http:/omnium.danmilne.fastmail.fm/files/%20jenson_scan76.gif) It is a word chosen both for its ‘physical’ beauty and for its meaning: it is the genitive plural of Latin _omnis,_ meaning _all_ or _of all._ But it is the Jenson text’s rhythmic nature and the strong horizontal lines, rather than the beautiful ligatures, which have contributed to the design of Omnium. As a straight-forward and business-like typeface, Omnium may not benefit from such stylistic ligatures. Perhaps they can be developed as a side-project. As you suggest, it would be a great challenge to design harmonious ligatures for such a rigid, geometric typeface.\n\n\\>therefore I think that the choice to draw the ‘Q’ and the ‘J’ below the baseline is “typographically correct”\n\nThe descending ‘Q’ and ‘J’ should not be seen as more ‘typographically correct’. The descending ‘J’ makes it easier to achieve even spacing (with fewer white space anomalies which disturb the horizontal movement of the reader’s eyes), but I would argue that as a form of the ‘J’ it is no more conventional than the non-descending model. Even as I draft this post in Microsoft Word, I notice that Morison’s ever-present Times New Roman sports a non-descending ‘J’. And most sanserifs as well… Omnium will use non-descending ‘J’s at the start of words and descending ‘J’s otherwise.\n\nDan\n\n"

I have adjusted curves on the ‘m’ and ‘n’ as well.\n\n----\n\n_Only two things I'd like to comment: the finishings of the 's' look a bit strong when compared with the finishing strokes of other letters e.g. the leg of the 'k', the one down right. The serif detail looks different. Is that on purpose or are you afraid of losing the squared shape? Also, that same purpose seems to affect the bowls like the one of the 'a', for instance. It gives it a broken shape, as intended, but I believe that the horizontal elongation should be enough to give the squared personality you seek, without being too attached to the roman attitude._\n\nThe ‘s’ is much revised: I have rounded the curves and given it a bit more forward movement. I think the lack of squareness in the italic helps to differentiate it from the roman.\n\nCheers,  \nDan\n\n"
