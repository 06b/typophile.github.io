Phil’s version was not a straight knock-off. He added a bunch of swash and alternate characters. Ironically, Phil’s contributions are missing from the URW digitization, so what you get is essentially just a knock-off of Pistilli Roman.</cite>\n\nHence, this might be the 'original’ swashy Didoni, or an unknown digitization of it.\n\n"

This new digital version evokes late 1960s magazine advertising, and includes the rarely seen swash variant, and features several newly created alternate swash caps (A, J, Q, Z, M, K,R) and one new alternate lowercase swash (s) and several lowercase ligatures.” — [Jason Walcott@Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20111109020636/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000118#about)  \nSeems to be a hit.\n\n"
