To buy a single weight, prove it, and only buy the complete family if it works fine?

A couple of foundry who offers font fot trial, in different ways:\n\nUnderware. You can buy for 10 euro the Dolly specimen book, which comes with a cd with the font, fully working. Then if you decide to use the font professionally, you have to buy the full license.  \n [http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=overview](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221808/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=overview \"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=overview\")\n\nB&P Type Foundry. You can download their fonts for free, but with limited glyphs - just to test them in layouts.  \n [http://www.bpfoundry.com/fonts/fonts.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221808/http:/www.bpfoundry.com/fonts/fonts.htm \"http://www.bpfoundry.com/fonts/fonts.htm\")\n\nThat said, there are some independent type designers who are very friendly and can help the buyer in deciding if the their font is suitable for him, even setting a test-layout, then sending the pdf to him.\n\nAlso, a way to see the fonts in use, though only on screen, is using the search function in Google Books (with the font name in the search field or a search phrase like \"set in [typeface name])\".\n\n"

Some large composing houses produced entire books of text showings -- cf. Kingsport, in three volumes. And, most importantly, they were \\*printed.\\*\n\nIt seems that in this digital age, there are plenty of opportunities for designers to see how typefaces _look,_ but perhaps not quite as many opportunities to judge how they _perform._\n\n"

It's kind of like how in an ice cream shop they'll give you a taster spoon.\n\nI'm not sure that this is the best model for fonts, though. Most retailers have great ways to test out headline faces, since you can use the \"Test Drive\" feature on MyFonts, H&FJ, vllg, Veer, FontShop, etc., take a screen shot, and place it in your document. But the tools for testing extended text types are limited, as Kent was saying. Perhaps foundries could have a tool where you specify line length, point size, leading, and a variety of other parameters, and it spits out a page of lorem ipsum in PDF format for you to print. It's not a perfect tool, but it would certainly help.\n\nOf course, this is all on the retailers. Retailers that want to market their fonts well have been introducing increasingly complex and useful tools for sampling fonts before you buy them. I think that it's only a matter of a few years before MyFonts or FontShop or someone else releases something like this.\n\n"

And I do. I am just wondering if it is a good idea to let the carpenter to test the hammer before he buys (in this case, I assume the carpenter goes to the store and watch it, handle it, compare it with other hammers and just after that he pays it). He doesn’t want to steal the hammer, he wants to buy it.\n\nAnyway, maybe it is not a good idea. Maybe it is better that the carpenter don’t touch the hammer before he pays. Maybe he should buy the hammer even if it doesn’t work so he can learn, and the next time he won’t buy that kind of hammers again (or he won’t buy in that store again, for that matter). Is this really the best for everybody?\n\n\\><cite>Remember the ol’ days when it was printers and type setters who owned type instead of designers?</cite>\n\nNo, I don’t remember those days. I wasn’t there: my first professional job was in 2000. And many typographers, increasing every year, are in the very same situation. And maybe because I live on this evil internet age, I really appreciate to test things before I buy them (NOT instead, at least not in my case). I assume some other people, including some typographers who didn’t know the old days, will think like this. They don’t care how difficult those days were; they care about solving their problems today.\n\nIf I could test the fonts, as I do with some other products, that would be great for me as a customer, since I can take more informed decisions, even if it is glyph-limited. (If it is a bad idea, it is OK, I was just wondering.) But I am a type designer as well, and I want to be someone who help their potential customers as much as I can, even if that means that someone will test my product and finally don’t buy.

But, on the other hand, as it doesn’t have any kerning, you say it doesn’t work for testing the font performance (except for anglophonic users, right?).\n\n—About kerning: I think kerning is important in a text font, but not essential in order to test it, given it has a good tracking. In addition: if you really think kerning is _that_ important, I don’t see why don’t include in it, because it will contain only kerning pairs of the letters you put in the sample (not enough for real texts). Or it may include only the most important kerning values, or whatever.\n\n—About upper and lowercase: upper and lowercase complete is not enough for a text font: even anglophonic users need to write sometimes names like François Mitterrand or César Chávez. And they certainly need the figures (not included).\n\nBut I suppose you are going to tell me now that anglophonic users may use it in this crippled condition, “as long as they don’t use any figures” (twenty-four instead of 24), and that a font without figures doesn’t give “any idea about a font’s performance”…\n\n"

We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.\"\n\nNow, going back to the subject of this thread, for sure the best way to judge a font is having it printed in high resolution by a professional service. But a helpful way for a typesetter to better understand how a font works (and not just how it looks), could be having some \"typical\" double page spread (a novel, an essay with footnotes and quotation, a poetry book), printable in A4. A thing that, in my opinion (and from my limited experience), most of the pdfs available in foundries' site don't do. For example, one of the reason I decided to buy a license for Whitman was the pdf made by Kent Lew, which somehow resembles a typical book-situation. I'm speaking of setting texts in books here.\n\nNow about the limited glyphs matter: I don't think that anybody could use such a font for a professional layout (besides logo and titling, maybe) - I have made a pdf test with the free BP Romain and even an English text shows problems (no numerals, wrong accent). Unfortunately, I can't attach it here. Anyway, if Cristobal decides to go with it for his Espinosa and Fondo (which look very nice, by the way), I think that they should have kerning enabled; otherwise they're useless.\n\n"

It's just difficult to reproduce the production processes involved, like how newspapers are printed.\n\nI am still up for the high-resolution (or variable-resolution) _bitmap_ PDF generator. There is no risk of extracting the embedded font files, and the user can see if the font/s look good under conditions within his or her control.\n\nFor other type-tasting options, Type Together's is a pleasant deal.\n\n"

Yes, I know, I know, it is sad…\n\nBut I really think that the new Espinosa is going to be better than Fondo (at least that’s the way I see it). It is completely redrawn. Hopefully you can see something about Espinosa in the next few months. And no, I don’t know yet if it is going to be in the form of a limited-glyph font. :P\n\n\\>I think that they should have kerning enabled; otherwise they’re useless.\n\nI’ll think about it in the meanwhile, but it makes sense to me.
