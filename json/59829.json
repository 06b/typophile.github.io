      "content": "Football clubs (and national teams too) are now getting into the habit of having their own bespoke numbers drawn.\n\nSome like the English Barclays Premier League and Coca-Cola Championship and Leagues 1 and 2 have to wear the league's own prescribed numbers (which are bespoke).\n\nEngland have recently moved away from numbers drawn by Jeremy Tankard towards something a little more traditional in the same vein as Gill Sans in keeping with their new kits which have a very classical feel (literally feels like cotton as opposed to polyester, but is in fact a blend of the two).\n\nLooking at the photo of Ronnie from the back, I'd say that the club's crest on the number is indicative of a bespoke design. That is not to say a club won't use an off-the-shelf typeface but my money's on bespoke, maybe designed in-house or by the Adidas replicas guys.\n\nI couldn't tell you if the clubs from La Liga are legally bound to use La Liga style numbers or not but, if so, these are not them (Real Madrid's crest makes them Real Madrid numbers).\n\n"

      "content": "I have noticed too that clubs playing in European competitions will sometimes wear numbers that are different form the domestic shirt numbers (albeit on exactly the same kit apart from the numbers), since the domestic league's numbers have a domestic league branding on them in a similar size and position to the Real Madrid crest on the number 9 as worn by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nYou can probably guess that I find the football numbers thing fascinating. Sorry if I've bored you!\n\n"
