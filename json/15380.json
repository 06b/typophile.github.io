  "content": "In this forum I have read a few remarks stating that Bitstream News Gothic is actually Trade Gothic, and it honestly looks that way if you compare the two. This [list of Bitstream font aliases](http://web.archive.org/web/20150327015313/http:/www.fontinfo.net/Font_Analog.html) actually lists several \"real names\" inluding Lightline Gothic.\n\nI was recently looking through a 1995 CA Design Annual and came across a Potlatch piece called \"Vintage Type\" designed by Kit Hinrichs (Pentagram). The spread showed an old ATF book with a digital News Gothic -- Bitstream News Gothic. I know Mr. Hinrichs has [used this](http://web.archive.org/web/20150327015313/http:/daidala.com/25feb2003.html) [type before](http://web.archive.org/web/20150327015313/http:/www.pentagram.com/portfolio-editorial-14.htm), so is it possible that he simply doesn't know any better? Or is it possible that Bitstream's version is based on a smaller size since it's not as narrow as other News Gothics? I think it's really curious...\n\n",
