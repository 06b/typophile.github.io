  "content": "Hi all.   \n   \nThis is last friday's effort from my Friday Fonts campaign. I'm continuing to work on my   \ngrotesque, but needed a break.   \n   \nIt's based on a photo I took of an antique child's toy. The original was woodburned so I   \ntried to keep some of that appeal. Hopefully it still has some appeal. When I eventually   \nrevamp my website, I was thinking of maybe offering it as a free font. Or should I try   \nto sell it?   \n   \nThanks for your thoughts,   \nRandy   \n ![AT Tenement](http://web.archive.org/web/20060521194028im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10941.gif)\n\n",

What do you think this is, the   \nID forum? :-) Well, I suspected there are other type hounds out there sniffing for alphabets.   \nThanks for the link. I particularly like the rubber stamp fonts.   \n   \nI was thinking of including the background ornaments in the font. They came from a box   \nof Korean tea I inherited.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"
