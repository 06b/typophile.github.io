  "content": "This is the sans serif version of Architrave, showing in the \"Serif\" forum. As an experiment, I clipped the serifs and most of the bracketing off to see if I could develop a suitable sans-serif companion font. The result is a modulated-stroke sans. I'm still entertaining the idea of producing a monostroke version as well.   \n   \nDavid Thometz   \n   \n ![architravesans.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102459im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/324.jpg)\n\n",

This   \nsaid, I think it's wonderful in the same woody   \nway Atlantis is. The stress is excellent - don't   \ngo monostroke with it.   \n   \nYour letters may have a place on my   \nstorefront sign anytime.   \n   \nStephen   \n   \nNote: I have no such shop - but I plan to open   \none \"Coles General Store\" solely for the   \nopportunity to showcase your fine work.\n\n"

Mono-weight is where it all started, and continues to push the fundamental forms of our limited writing system. I say go for it. I like the wacky smashed circle shapes of the C and G.\n\n"

In the same vein: don't feel too much pressure to make the family \"complete\" - even an italic might be a waste of time.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
