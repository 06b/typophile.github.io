  "content": "Hi! Everybody\n\nThis is the first time I use fontlab and I have a big problem because there are some nodes I can’t connect, if you move them they move individually.I created them in illustrator and then exported them to fontlab as EPS, and before this I checked in illustrator that the nodes were joined, and they were, but I don’t know what happens in fontlab.\n\nCan anyone tell me what’s wrong or if there are any good tutorials for me to learn?\n\nThanks in advanced\n\n",
