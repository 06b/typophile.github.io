      "content": "I like your present logo a lot more then this new idea...\n\nBut, if you are planning to use this, I would make the type about 20% smaller. I would also experiment with other typefaces. Perhaps something more mechanical/square to match the mark, or if your going for friendly, try lowercase and aligning the type to the bottom of the square.\n\nJeo.\n\n"
