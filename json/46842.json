  "content": "Hello,\n\nCan anyone recommend similar typefaces to PTL Skopex Serif?  \n [http://typecuts.com/fonts.php?kid=1](http://web.archive.org/web/20130715062624/http:/typecuts.com/fonts.php?kid=1 \"http://typecuts.com/fonts.php?kid=1\")\n\nBasically, a modern serif with some interesting features, such as fancy ligatures, etc. Small caps, and both lining/non-lining numerals would be a bonus.\n\nThank you very much!\n\nMax\n\n",
