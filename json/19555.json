  "content": "In [backpacker.gr](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021045718/http:/www.backpacker.gr/), in the projects section, you can find examples of old-fashioned greek lettering as it appears in various shop displays in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. Most of the presented specimens, have been designed (probably) 40 to 50 years ago. A great source of inspiration for script or display greek fonts.\n\nThere is an ongoing effort to collect as many specimens as possible. The list of photos will be updated whenever it’s possible.\n\n [‹ Strange word-breaks in InDesign CS](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021045718/http:/typophile.com/node/13157 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Room deco ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021045718/http:/typophile.com/node/19537 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
