Here is the lower- and uppercase. Numerals, punctuation, and ligatures will be here extremely soon.\n\nI started a font earlier called [Recut](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/node/63834). It wasn't that great but I learned how to use Fontforge. I took a couple months break from font-making, and now I've got a new serif that's hopefully better.\n\nTell me your thoughts and criticisms!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screenshot-1.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Newton.2010.3.11.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/files/Newton.2010.3.11.pdf) | 15.11 KB |\n| [Newton.2010.3.12.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/files/Newton.2010.3.12.pdf) | 19.53 KB |\n| [Newton.2010.5.10.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/files/Newton.5.10.pdf) | 16.94 KB |\n| [Newton.2010.5.13.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/files/Newton.5.13.pdf) | 20.24 KB |\n| [Newton.2010.5.18.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/files/Newton.5.18.pdf) | 20.82 KB |\n| [Newton.2010.5.20.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/files/Newton.2010.5.20.pdf) | 21 KB |\n| [Newton.2010.6.25.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/files/Newton-6.25.pdf) | 155.99 KB |\n| [20120401-text.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/typophile.com/files/20120401-text.pdf) | 513.79 KB |\n\n",

Here are my amateur critiques, to be taken with a grain of salt:\n\nThe bottom serifs of A and X make them look pigeontoed, and the same effect plagues the top serifs of W, X, and Y. X also seems kind of wide. I'm not crazy about the middle join on the K or the \"shelf\" of the G (what is that thing called, anyway?). The right side of the bottom serif of F has a bracket; I see that rounded feature elsewhere in the font but not on any other serif (P, for example). Speaking of which, I quite like your P.\n\nIt would be nice to see some sample words. On the whole, it looks really promising. Keep it up.\n\n"

My thought was that it would lessen the big gap those characters tend to create.\n\nI'm not crazy about the K join, or G stem serif either... In fact I had a lot of trouble with both letters. The G seems almost right though. When I made the F I couldn't get it to look right without the bracketing. My thoughts was that it's a bit like it's friends E and L.\n\n(The word samples are on the first post - I can't seem to find how to add images here.)\n\n"

The \"C\" looks a ton better.\n\n- The \"A\" and \"X\" feel considerably wider than the rest of the characters.\n\n- The \"M\" feels quite a bit heavier than the others (thicker strokes, that is)\n\n- The joins on the \"L\" and \"E\" (bottom left) seem very heavy. I can't tell if it's because of the stem or just the join.\n\nWould you consider tracking out your next specimen a little bit?

It's been _really_ helpful!\n\nI've made more progress since I last updated this thread, added extra weights and italics, ironing out some issues too. If anyone has any more critiques, I'd love to hear it! You can also download Neuton and follow along with the updates [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415101151/http:/impallari.com/projects/overview/neuton-serif-family).\n\nI've found that designing the weights seems to be especially tricky. Should the top of the 't' have a different shape in the light and extra light than the other versions? In some ways I think I've lost the feeling of the rest of the family in the extra bold as well.
