  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to create an identity for a art exhibition for a class and have a logo but am having trouble coming-up with a good body text typeface (s) for an invite to a reception for the event. I think it should be inviting and elegant but not too serious (even with a touch of whimsy) since it's a very playful exhibition.\n\nI've attached the logo if that helps. Thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416190939im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lob_logo_only_you_sexy_5659.jpg)\n\n",
