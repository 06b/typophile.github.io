Pictured (welcome back Typophile image upload!) are all three versions of \"Avant Garde Gothic Book\" rendered at 40pt. Note that the E+F and ITC versions are identical in size, weight and spacing, whereas the Monotype version differs quite a bit. At bottom is the [Avant Garde Gothic Alternates](http://web.archive.org/web/20140821015703/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=EF.101895.0.0) by Scangraphic (now owned by E+F).

(were they converted from postscript to TTF or vice verse, etc)...\n\nEven more newbie question:  \nI see that there is a postscript PC and a postscript MAC for sale...shouldn't a PC postscript work fine on a Mac?\n\nAny help greatly appreciated. I've been doing variations of these letters by hand in Illustrator for too long.\n\n"

I just purchased the alternates for my wife/partner and we can't figure out how they work because of what mik was dealing with originally. We own ITC Avant Garde which I have owned for over ten years. Not only can't I figure out exactly how they work but they are as mik said \"different sizes and weights\"  \nI would love some direction.\n\nThanks\n\n"
