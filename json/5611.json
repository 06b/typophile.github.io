  "content": "I am interested if any of you can think of any logos or type treatments of extremely long company names - preferably in a traditional style. I am currently working on an identity that is kicking my butt.   \n   \nThe Center for Aesthetic and Implant Dentistry   \n   \nI had worked up some ideas, but they were a little too contemporary for the client (well actually for his wife) - they want it to reflect the same style they are decorating the new place (cart before the horse - happens all the time to me) They have chosen a very elegant style with brocades, lots of scrollwork, chevrons, deep colors, and even griffins. Also being in Louisville there is the ubiquitous fleur de lis (city symbol). I have come up with some solutions that are... eh ok but still seem somewhat generic. The only one that I really am feelling anything from is the one below.   \n   \nThe critique I need is twofold. Do either ofthe two type treatments work for anyone. When I keep all the words the same I either end up with something that is blah or my eyes just get lost about halfway through - this was my attempt at adding some breathing room in the name. I also feel like the typeface should be traditional and needs to be a titling font like trajan or requiem or Felix, as I think anything too scripty is too difficult to navigate easily and will be hell at reduced sizes - I also keep getting the vibe when I try Upper and Lower case that it makes it look less like a company name and more like a tagline - It gives it too much Title or Sentence structure (does that even make sense?). So any suggestions about type would be most appreciated.   \n   \nThe second critique I want is of the symbol itself. I used several Bickham ornaments to piece together a fleur de lis that is unique in our area - though they are everywhere - whenever there is an interesting interpretation it actually revives it somewhat. But does this work, is the construction ok with line weight and everything? Or does it seem all fluff and no matter (which I guess could be part and parcel with anything along these lines anyway - kind of like eating a merringue - yummy air).   \n   \nHelp me typophiles before I run out of energy to even type the name of this practice one more time... ![caid1](http://web.archive.org/web/20141015155223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40609.jpg) ![caid2](http://web.archive.org/web/20141015155223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40610.jpg)\n\n",

If they're not already doing so, they will sooner or later start to say \"C.A.I.D.\", which is even worse than the long name.   \n   \nBut I guess wanting to create a new name is wishful thinking, there's nothing doing when dealing with a small firm, let alone a small firm where design decisions is made by the owner's wife.   \n   \nCome to think of it: the \\*very worst\\* design project is the one where you are in contact with the owner, but where the decisions are made by the the owner's wife and she wants the new logo to be identical to the new chairs, or rugs, or carpets... and their son or daughter has passed the first year in the art school.   \n   \nWell, make the most of it.   \n   \n--   \nS\n\n"

I have to admit, though, that i can't help having a negative reaction to bickham in general after designing and printing way too many wedding invitation sets.   \n   \nhave you considered poetica for the type? it might be too heavy, but some ornamented initial letters and such could be really nice.   \n   \nto my eye, the symbol feels a little light.. it might disappear at small sizes.   \n   \nmaybe dentistry on the same line as aesthetic and implant would work? then \"the center for\" could be smaller?\n\n"

Makes reading the name somehow bumpy and i feel emphasizing the words doesn't actually help. The name as a whole looks a little out of balance like you have it now.   \nThe symbol is nice, but like others said, it needs a little more weight.

You could use a flourishy type to mirror the fleure-de-lis and better intergrate the symbol with the type.   \n   \nThe Composition seems too symetrical and yet not symetrical enough. I'll try to clarify. Because the words are so balanced small Big small, then Big small Big I want them to be exactly centered but because \"aesthetic\" has more letters than \"Implant\" it's just a little off. That said I'm not so sure about my ampersand suggestion. Placing it smack dab in the center of all that type may put too much emphasis on the character. How does it look if the type is to the right of the symbol, kind of tucked into the downward curly-Q?\n\n"

Also, I too was worried about using the fleur at too small of a size so I kept it rather large on many of the pieces in the stationery. I have tried other configurations of the text and my eye keeps coming back to this one as being the most consistent with his traditional tastes. Here is one of the other options I played around with. BTW the tan is PMS 871 metallic gold not just a dirty tan as it may appear. I also am uploading a sample with the new type, a sample with the positions changed and a bolder fleur and a sample with a truncated fleur.   \n   \nDoes anyone have a suggestion on a way to keep the typestyles and flavor of this rendition but eliminate the near miss between the R in Center and the f in for?\n\n<!--attachment: CAID_Stationery-40800.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*314.2*stationery*CAID+Stationery%2epdf --><!--attachment: CAID_Stationery-40800.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*314.2*stationery*CAID+Stationery%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20141015155223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">stationery<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20141015155223/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/CAID_Stationery-40800.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>CAID Stationery.pdf</b></a> (314.2 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n\n![CAID2](http://web.archive.org/web/20141015155223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40801.jpg) ![CaidChoices](http://web.archive.org/web/20141015155223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40802.jpg)\n\n"
