      "content": "I think this looks like Comic lettering, but maybe that's just because it is only using caps. I searched MyFonts and Dafont for Comic fonts and found some 'close-but-no-cigar' choices: [Flim Flam](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025735/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fonthead/flim-flam/) from Fonthead; [Bigmouth](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025735/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/bigmouth/) from PizzaDude; [Blambot Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025735/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/blambot/pro/) (and many other choices from Blambot), including the free font [Digital Strip](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025735/http:/www.dafont.com/digital-strip.font?nb_ppp=50&text=BOHO+boho). Iconian Fonts also had a good selection of free comic fonts, including [Action Man](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025735/http:/www.dafont.com/action-man.font?nb_ppp=50&text=BOHO+boho).\n\nI'm never sure how much people want the exact font, or just a similar look. For hand-lettered fonts, our [Casual handwriting FAQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025735/http:/typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq) says it all.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
