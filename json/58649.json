Be aware that it can be hard to win the ebay auctions unless you use auction sniping software to automatically bid only in the final moments before an auction ends. Ebay prices tend to be much lower than the used book dealers because the used book world is full of vendors who have ample shelf space and will price a these books at three times (literally) what it will sell for on ebay in hopes that a someone who doesn’t know better will fall for it. Some of them are available on Google Books, but because PDF readers are not optimized for dealing with a long series of images they’re rather hard to use.\n\n"
