      "content": "Well... Any program which converts PST1 to a PST1 CFF-flavoured OpenType font shouldn't touch the nodes of a glyph or its metrics, and it should grab the kern table and turn it into a kern feature. (Although it will probably do a \"standard\" 1:1 kern table with a line of code for each kern pair. A bit of a waste of OpenType functionailty, but there you go.)\n\nSo, Palatine, there should be no degradation at all. Conerting Type 1 to TrueType curves might result in some changes, however.\n\nI use TransType for Mac from Pyrus software to do conversions, although this doesn't always work. (Depending upon the font family and member naming.) In which case I go to FontLab.\n\nNow, I hate to be a spoilsport, but have you checked the EULAs for the fonts you plan to convert? Some foundries don't allow this kind of thing. (It's often referred to as \"decompilation\", and some foundries will wag their fingers and make \"tsk\" sounds if you even consider doing it to their fonts.)\n\n"
