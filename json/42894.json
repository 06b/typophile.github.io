I can’t even imagine how the CSS will be able to tell Flash what embedded typeface to use (via “font-family”?). Does this even make sense?\n\nShould I upload an example?  \nI’m interested in having two or more typefaces that are embedded, show up on a single line together, oppose to separate text fields.\n\n(I wish typography was easier in Flash...)\n\n=[\n\nanything helps | thnx guys! =)\n\n",
