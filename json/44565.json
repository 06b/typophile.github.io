  "content": "Hi all,\n\nThis is an odd one. I'm struggling on a suitable typeface to use on a jazz website (all types of jazz, not just a specific genre (dammit! I was looking for an excuse to use Device fonts Blackcurrant; and a 60s style jazz site would've been perfect) but everything from Eartha Kittt to Jamie Cullum.\n\nApparently it has to be \"classy\". Now classy I can do. Jazz I can do. Together?\n\nAny quick suggestions - freeform or otherwise ;) - greatly appreciated.\n\nsimon\n\n",

      "content": "You could use a typeface that has a \"cultural\" axis.  \nBy that, I mean that instead of the usual axes such as weight, scale and slant, there are, for instance, historical variants.  \nChalet, of course, represents several scenes.  \nHypatia has options too, with old-style and geometric as variants on the same body.  \nOf my faces, [Eunoia](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019085711/http:/www.shinntype.com/eunoia.html) and [Panoptica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019085711/http:/www.shinntype.com/panoptica.html) provide alternate vibes within the same general brand.\n\n"
