  "content": "I've been working on a rounded style of Houschka for a while now. It's now OpenType as I have included some new features. Some people were put off the original Houschka because of the rounded shape of the A, W and w, (although a lot of others liked it for that very reason). So I have included contextual alternates of these characters in the new rounded version, as well as small caps (also with alternate A and W), lining and non-lining and tabular figures, and discretionary ligatures ct, sp and st.\n\nAny other discretionary ligature suggestions?\n\nThanks,\n\nNick Gooke, G-Type\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [HR test.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127044412/http:/typophile.com/files/HR%20test.pdf) | 29.6 KB |\n| [HRtest2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127044412/http:/typophile.com/files/HRtest2.pdf) | 90.44 KB |\n| [Houschka Rounded guide.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127044412/http:/typophile.com/files/Houschka%20Rounded%20guide.pdf) | 182.09 KB |\n\n",

I wasn't familiar with Houschka in its original incarnation, but i prefer it rounded, and in the light weight and would more likely use the NON rounded shape A and W's.\n\nI'm seeing some glitches (white knockouts?) in Adobe Reader as certain zoom levels...\n\nleft stem of the m  \nleft stem of the n (less so than the m)  \nAE combo overlap  \ng where the bowl enters the stem  \nG where the curve enters the stem\n\nI guess you're probably aware of this if it's work in progress, but just though i'd better mention it.\n\n"

You're right – this is a work in progress.\n\nI actually prefer the round style to the original Houschka, plus I have improved the shapes in some characters.\n\nThe good thing about OpenType is that you can choose between the different styles of A and W's.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

      "content": "This would make a great addition to the surprisingly hit and miss category of rounded fonts.\n\nthe p, q, b have the same corner treatment where the strokes moves from straight to curve, yet the d is a right angle, I rather enjoy the treatment of the p, q, b. you might even make the angle begin early in the vertical stroke.\n\nalso, the rounds in the lowercase seem a bit inconsistent, the o, c, e seem to be based on a perfect circle while the g, p, d, b, q, have more robust curves. I feel perfect circles tend to have points on the upper and outermost extremes.\n\nI dig it!\n\n"

It covers East and Central European, Turkish and Cyrillic. It has a standard character set, contextual and stylistic alternates, lining and old-style numbers, both proportional and tabular, small caps, and 3 extra stylistic sets (as shown on the pdf). The top example is the standard set (with small caps).  \nSet 1 is modernish, set 2 is Art Decoish and set 3 has unicase characters.\n\nPlease see new: HRtest2.pdf\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"
