The question I´m asking it´s not typography related, but here it goes anyway.\n\nI´ve designed a small book (it was my graduation course thesis) about typeface legibility and readability, and I would like to know if anyone knows about any company that offers services on very short runs of book printing and binding?\n\nI live in Portugal, so the company must have a shipment service to Portugal.\n\nThanks very much.\n\n",

      "content": "You can get this kind of book printing from an online service such as [Lulu.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021230217/http:/www.lulu.com/). [Acme Bookbinding](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021230217/http:/www.acmebook.com/) near Boston will give more personalized service.  \nBoth can ship internationally, but to a book printer, anything under 1000 copies is a very short run. If you plan to print several hundred copies, you may prefer to print them in Europe to avoid a very slow and/or expensive delivery. [IBT Global](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021230217/http:/www.integratedbook.com/index1.html) has a facility in London.\n\n"
