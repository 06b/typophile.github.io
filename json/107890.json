Its usage will be more for letters than numerals but this sample here really captures the essence of what I'm looking for. Modern meets athletic.\n\nI ask all of you great wizards and gurus here for help identifying this font or pointing me to something close.\n\nThe Under Armour typeface is another example of what I feel is modern meets athletic and what I'm looking for, although the style of the \"500\" is closer to what I need.\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124044704im_/http:/www.starrett-lehigh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/under-armour-inc-logo.gif)\n\nAll recommendations will be greatly appreciated. Gratitude in advance.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Spartan Font, custom \n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [500ex.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124044704/http:/typophile.com/files/500ex.png) | 55.17 KB |\n\n",
