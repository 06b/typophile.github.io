      "content": "What about right clicking to bring up menus? What about click and drag for selections? Within the context of this site, which requires only simple navigation, no clicking is ok. But I think that so long as we have to drag mice about rather than do everything through the keyboard (like in the old days) because it adds functionality which reduces the amount of stressful wrist movements with the mouse that can make carpal tunnel problems happen. This is why I personally prefer the greater comfort of my tablet, despite the fact that it takes up most of my desk!\n\n"

      "content": "Great site, a very interesting concept.\n\n2Nepenthe: dragging can be easily reilzed within the idea (e.g. you hold cursor over the obejct you've got to drag for 5 secs, then it sticks to the cursor and moves till you cursor remains still for 5 secs). The major issue here is usability.\n\nSpeaking of tablets, do you use the tablet's pen for plain surfing and navigation through software windows? I prefer the tablet's mouse with mine, using pen only in Photoshop.\n\n"

      "content": "It's a very interesting concept, but it's all Flash and there are no unique URLs per page or area, which runs counter to many of the underlying concepts of the web and accessibility in the first place.\n\nBut judged as an interactive concept alone, it's intriguing. I find all of the movement and reconfiguration to be a bit much, and the information density would require a lot of handling and segmenting so an errant mouse hit wouldn't send the user flying through the site.\n\nThis all sounds negative, but I do like it.\n\n"

      "content": "It's a nice idea. I agree with Chris...too much Flash. Too many websites do this and make it difficult to navigate their site. Like Chris was saying, with no unique URLs you can't hit the back button and go to information that you were just looking at. As a guy who gets \"mouse cramps\" on his hand pretty frequently, I'd love to see an interface that just used keyboard commands. Sometimes I hate \"meeces to pieces.\"\n\n"

      "content": "There is some opinions as I see, let's speak about the line which say the site is full of flash: no unique URL. I think this opinion is true. But I think if we think of future of web to make it like a huge multimedia web.. then this site will be a good move.  \nThe site was speaking about to use click or not to use click, it looks like how scientists think in planes, that they try these days to make the driver of the plane drive it with his head only, I saw a documentary in Discovery Science about that case, which reflects that they are moving forward in this technology in solid steps. Let me say this site is very good as a source for designer who work on flash as web or as CD that it is not necessary to make all your buttons click able! What if you made a button some place in an interactive CD or site working by rolling over your courser on it? It may do a strange effect.  \nSorry for speaking a lot, but let me declare things by graphics. I made here a small experiment to describe what I mean, this may be used as a surprise for the person who suppose to click.  \n [http://www.deviantart.com/view/20981312/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017053130/http:/www.deviantart.com/view/20981312/ \"http://www.deviantart.com/view/20981312/\")  \nSurprised ?  \nI saw a file like that in past, by someone I know in channel flash I guess while I was learning Macromedia Flash in 1999, I just made something like it to show you.\n\n"
