Will of course only work for Type 1 fonts, but on the plus side, it's so easy anyone can do it.\n\n"

Since the position of your first line is going to depend on the ascenders in the first line _of your current text frame_, they may differ from frame to frame; and hence, the position of the baseline grid, which starts at the bottom of that same first line.\n\nStore these settings in an Object style, so you can apply it to every frame where you need it.\n\n"
