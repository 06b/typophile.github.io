Unless part of the letters had been modified though (at once, the “E” and the “S”, as well as the “8”, evidently don’t match), I believe that’s hardly it?... Couldn’t get any closer than Europa Grotesk, myself, either, which also doesn’t quite match yet (roughly, still missing that shorter horizontal middle bar in the “E”, at least)...\n\nWould greatly appreciate any further help to get to the right match, thank you! :-)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007161040im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/rsmt_4798.JPG)\n\n [‹ Virgin script](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007161040/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36241 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Newcastle and Stella Artois beer logos ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007161040/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36224 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
