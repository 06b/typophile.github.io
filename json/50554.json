  "content": "Hi all\n\nI’m using Indesign cs3 to generate a pdf.  \nThe pdf will contain only a jpg image and i’m trying to get the smallest file size possible for screen display.  \nMy question is what would be the best way to do it.  \nWould it be using the save for web in photoshop and lowering the jpg quality, or would it be best to use a high quality jpg and reduce the image quality in the pdf export settings in Indesign?\n\nI tried both ways, and the results opticaly look practicly the same, but the advantage of photoshop is that it presents a lot more options available using the save for web command.  \nAnyway, it’s always nice to now how professionals usually do.\n\nHope i’m being clear enough.\n\nThanks in advance  \nRegards\n\n [‹ Accent height - Multiple Master ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019093740/http:/typophile.com/node/50223 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [TrueType hinting for the space glyph? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019093740/http:/typophile.com/node/50213 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I don’t know if this makes the smallest PDF possible, but small enough for me.\n\nBut if the outcome is really important for you in this case, I would just try the different options you describe, and see which method is the most convenient / best. :)\n\n"

      "content": "yeah i came across a similar problem when i worked on an online literary journal. i find saving postscript files and converting them with distilller helps a lot. you can even create your own compression script (called .joboptions i think) in distiller to specify just where you want to ’squeeze’ the compression rates and whatever. just go into distiller \\> settings \\> edit adobe pdf settings and a dialog box comes up with options.\n\nthen just make sure when you save as you call it something different to the joboption file you based it on.\n\nif you’ve never used distiller before it’s not very complicated. after you’ve saved the ps file, open distiller, choose the setting from the drop down box (which you should’ve made a new setting for, or else pick one of the defaults) and drag the ps file into distiller.\n\nvoila. i garauntee it’ll be smaller than the same file as an exported pdf.\n\n"

      "content": "Saving to the smallest filesize as Quincunx suggested is a pretty good start. You could also change the compatibility to Acrobat 6, it makes the file size a bit smaller, and most people have Acrobat 6 by now.  \nChanging compression options at the Export pdf dialogue window helps, too (from the small file default 150 to 72 dpi, for example)\n\nIt all depends what your needs are, the Photoshop save for web option isn’t a bad option, either.\n\n"
