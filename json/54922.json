Apart from maintaining the inventory of the bar, the treasurer's principal duty was to distribute a printed report of the Society's finances after dinner at the Annual Meeting.  \nWhen dinner was done, the members launched into the traditional critique of the Treasurer's Report. Mind you, no one paid a bit of attention to what it said about money. But woe to the treasurer whose column heads weren't centered properly, or whose kerning was imperfect. It was truly a case of Type Police Brutality.\n\n"
