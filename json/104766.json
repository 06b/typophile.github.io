The following is a symbol I am currently iterating over -\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425045853im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ikebana-3_5775.png)\n\nand the black and white version -\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425045853im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ikebana-2_4510.png)\n\nI am my own client, so life is hard and I need external opinions.\n\n- For one, if it resembles anything existing (I can't think of anything).\n- For two, if it's too generic or, preferably, unique enough to be memorable.\n- For three, what's your first impression of it?\n\nThanks\n\n",
