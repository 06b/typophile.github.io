I feel like they did a good thing by increasing that, because the letter is so much taller, it needs to be wider to support itself against everything else. Just the \"U\" \"N\" Combination bothers me, because the further away you are, the more of a gap appears because of the curve of the N.\n\ncourtney\n\n"
