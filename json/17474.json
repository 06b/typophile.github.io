Where, up until the 1960s & 70s, there was an active network of  \ncollotype ateliers scattered throughout England, Europe, America and  \nJapan, there are now only a handful of professional studios left  \nworldwide.\n\nThis exhibition traces some of the techniques use from the late 19th  \ncentury to the present, featuring work from some of the long lost  \ncompanies such as the renowned Cotswold Collotype Company, Waterlows and  \nJaffe. Also featured is a rare and intriguing round up of contemporary  \nartists original prints from the world’s last surviving studios.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n**Exhibition preview & opening lecture: Tuesday 24 January**\n\nWe begin in the Exhibition Room with a preview of the exhibition from  \n5.30pm before moving upstairs to the Bridewell Hall for the accompanying  \nlecture at 7.00pm.\n\nOur speaker, Dr Paul Thirkell, is a Senior Research Fellow at the Centre  \nfor Fine Print Research, University of the West of England. One of  \nThirkell’s main areas of research is the reassessment (especially in  \nfine art printmaking terms) of high quality nineteenth century  \nindustrial printing techniques. Besides working to reconstitute valuable  \nlost processes, his research has also led to the integration of digital  \nimaging techniques to create unique contemporary hybrids.\n\nThirkell’s principal area of exploration has been through the collotype  \nprocess, ultimately bringing him into contact with what threatens to be  \nthe last generation of professional master collotype printers. To foster  \nan international dialogue and exchange of knowledge at this crucial  \npoint in collotype history, Thirkell hosted the second international  \ncollotype conference in Bristol. Taking place early in 2005, it brought  \ntogether representatives from studios in Italy, Japan, the USA and the  \nUK to share their insights. He also runs a small collotype studio at the  \nCentre for Fine Print Research and has recently published a portfolio of  \nten artists’ works that explore the dichotomy between original and  \nreproduction in fine art print.\n\nEntry to the lecture, £5 or £3 concessions, on the door.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n**Exhibition: 25 January to 23 February**\n\nExhibition Room,  \nSt Bride Library,  \nBride Lane, Fleet St,  \nLondon EC4Y 8EQ\n\nTelephone: 020 7353 4660  \nHours of opening: Tuesday-Thursday, 12.30-5pm (9pm on Wednesday)\n\nWe would recommend that you do call beforehand to check accessibility  \nto the exhibitions, especially if making a long trip.\n\nEntry to the exhibition is free.\n\nFor further information, see: [www.stbride.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20070805150935/http:/www.stbride.org/ \"www.stbride.org\")\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n",
