  "content": "Forgive me if this topic has already been discussed to death before...   \n   \nThere have been a lot of dicussions on Typophile recently that have made me wonder: what would the type industry be like, and what would the public perception of type and typography be, if standard fonts packages were not bundled with operating systems software or word processing software?\\* (aside from system fonts, of course)   \n   \n\\*I believe someone recently mentioned a country where font bundling with OSes is, in fact, illegal.   \n   \nJust last Friday, I educated a coworker on the wonderful world of fonts, what the actual differences were between fonts like Garamond and Times, and why they cost \"so much money,\" as she put it. After describing all of the basic design and technological components, she completely understood. She also wholeheartedly agreed that people would be much more generally aware, if, instead of receiving a pre-fab fonts package with their software, they were offered the opportunity to choose, say 50 fonts from a larger list. She also said that _she would prefer this method_.   \n   \nIn my mind, I see the result being a totally different dynamic between the public, and type designers, and their distributors, wherein consumers expect to pay for quality, and are aware that fonts are a consumable good that can help or harm their work, much like a computer, or a piece of software, or a car, or a printer. This would stand in contrast to the current situation, where many people don't even consider fonts to be the work of people, let alone an achievement requiring skill and time. I'd also imagine that this awareness and subsequent attention to a largely rarified and ignored market would drive demand up and prices down. This could also popularize the notion of buying fonts for specific purposes, much like we buy outfits for particular purposes. Of course, the attendant curses of piracy, fads, and pop-culture homogeneity could overrun any positives, I suppose.   \n   \nComputers and software (and, in a way, the typewriter) have reinforced the idea of fonts as small features of word processing and typing, rather than significant expressive and communicative devices. The OS and software developers remove the necessity of choice, and perpetuate (to some extent) the belief that people don't buy and choose fonts, they select them from menus dictated by software companies. The web completes this triangle of perception by reinforcing the idea that fonts are available for free and commonly exchanged. Would removing fonts from the equation solve some of these problems? Ironically, because of these groups and devices, we are in a unique place in history where the means to output typeset (I use the term loosely) materials are accessible to many at a _much_ lower point of entry, in both price and complexity. Is this an opportunity for positive development, or is this a pipe dream? (ignoring, for a moment, the logistics of changing the current system)   \n   \nI'm eager to hear more experienced perspectives on this situation, which has been the standard for me throughout my design education and career. I'm particularly interested by the opinions of those of you running your own smaller type businesses.\n\n",

      "content": "Nick claims that font bundling with OSes and applications is illegal in Canada. I believe that his interpretation of the relevant law is more than a little suspect. He seems to think that bundling software together is legally the same as giving some of the pieces away for free. I suggest that's a question for lawyers and courts, but I am unaware of any cases relating to that Canadian law which support Nick's interpretation.   \n   \nIn any case, the main problem with giving users a choice of fonts is that it means another variable that you've introduced that makes everybody's setups different. Even though you and I are both using \"only what came with the computer\" we will have different sets of fonts. From the point of view of diversity that's great, but it makes it harder for us to work together. It also means tons more testing and development for the folks selling the OS/apps, and increases their support costs.   \n   \nI like the idea personally, but I suspect that app/OS developers are unlikely to take the route to that extreme any time soon.   \n   \nOn the other hand, I can easily imagine with a situation like the Adobe Creative Suite, where you had a choice of \"registration incentives\" and one of them was a font family, one could offer a choice of several different families instead. Not quite as extreme, but still plays on the same theme.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

But \"giving\" and \"tied products\" are both damaging to competition, and in summary could be considered \"dumping\". All which are founded in Canadian law. Apparently American and European law also.   \n   \nOne law which may be of interest to Nick is \"Canadian Content in Broadcasting\".

However, it's a battle that large corporate interests (even if they started out small) always seem to end up winning.   \n   \nI would love to challenge Adobe and Apple in court, because the way I see it, the situation is hugely unfair, and there are laws against unfair business practices. Here I am, trying to sell fonts to people who have already been supplied, free of charge, with a large selection along with their operating system and major software applications. But really Thomas, easy for you to say this is a matter for lawyers and courts, but what a waste of time and money it would be for me to test the legality of this practice in court.   \n   \nLeaving aside the amateur or prosumer market for now, my potential customers are design professionals who, by and large (ie 95%) use Apple computers and Adobe software. These software giants are, to all intents and purposes, and notwithstanding Corel and web designers on Wintel, monopolists. So when they bundle fonts, everyone gets them.   \nI'm very familiar with their customer, because before I started my foundry in 1999, I was one of them (an art director). From 1989 to about 1993, I bought a lot of fonts. Then, Quark and Adobe started releasing their major upgrades on CD, and Adobe started bundling large numbers of fonts on the CDs.   \n   \nAs Pamela Pfiffner says in the Adobe book \"Inside the Publishing Revolution\", the early years of digital were a boom for Adobe font sales. But the boom levelled off as designers rounded out their font libraries, as more digital foundries entered the competition, as piracy and free fonts became widespread, facilitated by the Internet, and as, most significantly from my perspective as a font user, I was getting a large supply of fonts (spam, according to Gerald) from Adobe every time I upgraded Illustrator.   \n   \nBundling is continued with the CS, and Apple has upped its participation, with a large collection of fonts (not system fonts) that come with OS X.   \n   \nThe numbers involved are quite shocking in the disparity between what is acquired by the licensee and what is paid for.   \nA top selling \"indie\" typeface may perhaps sell, at a guess, a couple of thousand copies worldwide, during a year. However, every font included in an Adobe bundle is distributed by the million.   \n   \nHistorically, very few type designers have made much of a living at it. Now it's a bit better, but, compared to the potential of digital media, all those hundreds of millions of computer users as potential retail customers, the realization may be even smaller.   \n   \nPerhaps I am wrong on this, as I have no data to support my claim, other than my own experience and observations, but I believe that the vast majority of independent foundries are able to exist thanks to custom work and niche markets of publications and corporations that require large multi-user licences, while the \"retail\" mass market of millions of graphic artists/designers does not support them. And of course, many independent foundries are also supported by the \"other\" work of their pricupal(s), such as graphic design.   \n   \nThere appear to be other niches that are profitable for indie foundries, genres such as pixel fonts, and scripts, but it's worth noting that these are genres that have little or no representation in the bundles from Adobe and Apple.\n\n"

I mean, Quark doesn't come with any fonts, right? It's not an absolute must-have-to-stay-competitive kind of a feature.   \n   \nThe registration incentives that Thomas envisioned could be a way to start people off, but then they'd have to go and ::gasp:: buy any others they'd need.

A couple of decades ago, I helped to set up what is called \"technology transfer\" infrastructures throughout the US (commercializing intellectual property throughout public and private stakeholders, from research labs to universities and corporations). So, a single piece of technology from a small lab in New Mexico (which was designed for a single and specific purpose, would be channeled through the tech transfer process to find MULTIPLE uses, and thus multiply its revenue). Following this example: if a font designer designs a font, and company A produces something which includes the design of the font (say, a logo), Company A is receiving revenues from its product, but the type designer is not... but it could, yes? Couldn't type designers, graphic artists, even basic human labor receive a percentage of the sale of the product, rather than a \"token\" exchange of value? Why have we all just accepted the notion that the resources necessary to produce a product are just tokens of value? We treat each other as tokens... and we treat the environment as tokens. But what is the REAL value of human labor, or of water, or a font?\n\nOkay, time out...\n\n"

But US design patent #1, back in 1842, was for a typeface by George Bruce. [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=D1](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212153/http:/www.google.com/patents?vid=D1 \"http://www.google.com/patents?vid=D1\") So it is hardly an Adobe innovation. Are you saying Adobe was the first to resume this practice in the digital age? That may very well be.\n\nAluminum wrote: \"I think it's a a bit of an assumption that bundled Operating System fonts directly take away from sales potential of other fonts.\"\n\nWhich is true, but it seems that at least the fonts that are bundled are sure to sell less.\n\n\"It makes sense only if one assumes every purchaser of an operating system has a vested interest in purchasing commercial fonts.\"\n\nThat is clearly not logically true. It makes sense if you assume that SOME purchasers of OSes would be interested in purchasing fonts if hardly any were bundled, and that SOME portion of their demand for fonts will be sated by bundled fonts.\n\nEven when I was at Adobe, I don't think I ever disputed Nick Shinn's arguments that bundled fonts reduced the sales of other fonts. Of course they do. It's only a question of how much, and whether it's perceived as \"good\" (value for end users) or \"bad\" (reduced sales for folks who are not the lucky ones whose fonts got bundled).\n\nRegarding bundling of fonts vs whether \"average users\" would pay for fonts, there was a brief period in the early 90s when computers were taking off, few fonts were bundled, and quality fonts were sold in high volumes to average users, but in heavily discounted bundles (not so much with apps, except Corel's, mostly just fonts).\n\nThen once large numbers of fonts were bundled with OSes and apps, and the cheap bundles had sold lots, the retail market for full-price fonts collapsed in a hurry, around 1994 or so. The big corporate version of the type industry has never been the same since.\n\nCharles E wrote: \"As I understand it, in the United States at least, a type face \\*design\\* cannot be copyright protected.\"\n\nQuadibloc replied: \"That \\*was\\* true, but now there is some limited protection for font designs in the U.S.\"\n\nPerhaps Quadibloc is under some misconception that design patent for fonts is the same as copyright, and that this is new? But as mentioned above, it is 170 years old. I know of no new, limited protections for font designs in the abstract (as opposed to their instantiations as specific computer font files).\n\nUS design patent has a very brief term, and only exists after an expensive registration process. That's why pretty much nobody besides Adobe uses this approach.\n\n"

The abstract design (typeface) is not protected by copyright in the USA. However, the implementation of that design as a font file is protected like software.\n\nStatus quo in the USA: The copyright office accepts registrations of the font file code, and the Adobe v SSi case upheld the principle in federal district court. But that's not new: registration of fonts dates back about 20 years, and the court ruling was 15 years ago.\n\n"
