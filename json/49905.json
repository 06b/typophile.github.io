  "content": "Hi,\n\nMy new client has Futura Condensed Light as corporate typeface. They use it for the body text and some headings. Can anybody recommend a technique to emulate this font with a browser-safe font? I was thinking of Arial but I am not sure if it's the best solution. Any ideas?\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n",

So far, afaik, it is only safari that supports it, with firefox coming soon.  \nYou could try specifying century gothic, as it is a quite common win font (85% of windows users, according to [this survey](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415113030/http:/www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/sampler-WindowsResults.shtml))\n\n"
