  "content": "Hello folks,  \nseeing all these amazing typefaces here I feel a little intimidated posting this, but I would love to hear some advice from more experienced designers. My goal is to create a strong headline for the openSUSE Linux distribution.\n\n[http://jimmac.musichall.cz/images/blog/5thleg-wip.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022208/http:/jimmac.musichall.cz/images/blog/5thleg-wip.pdf)\n\nThe obvious inspiration is Cholla by Sibylle Hagmann. I haven't gotten to the point of tackling spacing and kerning. Still only figuring out the glyphs. I'm struggling with c,e. Not really happy with Q, W and B. Thanks for all your critique and suggestions.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [5thleg-wip4.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022208/http:/typophile.com/files/5thleg-wip4.png) | 48.12 KB |\n| [sketch.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022208/http:/typophile.com/files/sketch.png) | 342.26 KB |\n\n",

Added lowercase numerals and simplified the capitals.\n\nAs this was meant to be a Cholla replacement for future openSUSE community branding materials I don't want to go that far away from Cholla look. Feeling similar was one of the goals.\n\n"

Some of the clear differences can be seen in the m and the r, where 5th Leg has a semicircle extension and the m has smoother humps and flat feet and is a bit stouter.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».
