One of them is the comprehensive collection of modern pictograms in FF Dingbats 2.0.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100926115529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ff_dingbats_500_3622.png)\n\nDesigned back when [Zapf Dingbats](http://web.archive.org/web/20100926115529/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/zapf_dingbats_ot/) were the only symbols in font form, the FF Dingbats™ package was the first to illustrate modern communication, with some 800 images and icons of faxes, ISDN, disks, and keyboards. But the face of the tech world has changed significantly since the early ’90s. Floppy disks and cassette tapes have gone the way of the dinosaurs. So [Johannes Erler](http://web.archive.org/web/20100926115529/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/johannes_erler/) and [Henning Skibbe](http://web.archive.org/web/20100926115529/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/henning_skibbe/) have revisited FF Dingbats, redesigning it for the new modern age of flat panels and iPhones®.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100926115529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ff-dingbats-20-490_6006.png)\n  \n_The old and the new FF Dingbats_\n\n**What else is new in FF Dingbats 2.0?**   \nThe style and finish of the pictograms is now consistent with today’s stylistic vocabulary. Arrow and number fonts have been reworked and extended. All symbols have been sorted into clear categories and the font “Strong Forms” font includes the most needed symbols with simpler, bolder lines. Also new in 2.0: quickly add color fills via an OpenType-powered [layering feature](http://web.archive.org/web/20100926115529/http:/ffdingbatsfont.com/glyph-set/index.html). All this makes [FF Dingbats 2.0](http://web.archive.org/web/20100926115529/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_dingbats_20_ot/) a state-of-the-art font package again and the largest collection of contemporary symbols and icons for office communication.\n\n» Get a free Sampler font and learn more about FF Dingbats 2.0 OpenType at the new microsite **[FFDingbatsFont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100926115529/http:/ffdingbatsfont.com/)**\n\n",
