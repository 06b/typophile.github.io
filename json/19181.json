      "content": "It’s almost identical to a script called ’Hemlock’ that was one of the film type brush scripts (many are shown in the Solotype Catalog). I think it was digitized as ’Gideion’ in the Expresiv Brush Script Collection. A German company called Typo Bach is listed as a supplier in the Script Types book I found the font in. The only difference I see is that the ’i’ has no serif in Hemlock.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Frank Bartuska was another whose scripts look very similar to Benguiat’s. The ’Hemlock’ name is, I suspect, a Solotype re-naming. since he seemed to group these scripts in alphabetic clusters, with H and J for brush script styles. I suppose Hemlock is as good an answer as any.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
