I seem remember some discussion about it a few months ago…\n\nI’m not sure that it would be appropriate to revive a face from a living designer. I also know of a few cases of children of designers who got peeved when their parents’ typefaces suddenly appeared out of the blue in digital format (for sale by third parties, sometimes without even proper attribution).\n\nBest bet would be to contact the designer or the family directly, in my opinion.

Because the 10 point (same page) seems like quite a boring monoline; and it seems to have been cut at a later date (and probably by a different hand), since the IN’s 1905 specimen book (which I got my hands on recently - it’s quite amazing) only shows the 12 (and shows it much better - p102) and the caption says only one size was available.

      "content": "\\>Well, how about all those typefaces that need REdigitizing?\n\nThere is always scope to do a digital version of any metal type, with much leeway for interpretation. First, there is the question of which size(s) one uses for one’s master.  \nThen there is the question of “process”, or ink gain: for the model, does one take a clean piece of type (or even the designer’s drawings), or a printed image with a lot of gain — or something in between? Also to be considered: the amount of gain to be expected in printing from the digital type (if indeed print is going to be the final medium).\n\nAnd of course, every designer has their own personality to put into a typeface, in both their conceptual attitude, and in their feeling for form, expressed in the particular shape of curves and texture of detail. A physical signature.\n\nSo it’s not really a question of faces that NEED re-digitizing, but of what fresh interpretation a type designer today can bring to bear on something from the past.\n\nHaving said that, I still side with Hrant in preferring new original work, even though I am quite happy to oblige clients/customers by reworking older designs.

What makes a metal typeface great is not the design per se, but the implementation at the various sizes. Until you are willing to restrict a metal design to one size you cannot get it to rival the printers’ work of yore. But this applies to new designs too, doesn’t it?
