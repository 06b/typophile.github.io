They're the only decorative flourishes in an otherwise rather austere design, and they might create an inconsistency in spacing ( **gh** will set closer than **ah** , **nn** will set closer than **un** ).\n- To my not-so-fresh-anymore eyes, the top and bottom of the bowl on **b** look thinner and more tapered than the corresponding strokes on **g**.  \n\n"

It's a very important letter to me, also the notch and the tail is a signature result of the technique and tools (a flat nibbed pen ran twice, first vertically, then horisontally). I'll look into **b/g**.\n\n"

The r as it is now looks a bit clipped at the join compared to the m, n, and p, although all of them seem a bit slim. The q on th eother hand looks great.\n\nMaybe for the a (before doing other changes mentioned above), if you move over the join for the tail a little to the bottom left and then pull down more for the curve on the bowl. Right now, it feels like it's been pushed way over to the right. Something more like this (I didn't touch the bowl in this):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713221125im_/http:/typophile.com/files/untitled_sans_quickfixtest_a_4044.png)\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

Maybe it's just my eyes plying tricks on me with the way the semi-serifs are placed in there making a sequence like \"un\" feel like the middle two stems have different widths at the top and bottom. Not necessarily a critique, just be aware.\n\nI echo Dan about the g, although I think it might have the same weight as most of the others, but the e and o and f to me seem a bit thin. The R looks somewhat anemic, but what might work better is to lengthen out the P R E F characters, which have a lot smaller horizontal width, so maybe make them as wide as the V or N might help.\n\nAlso you P and R have quite distinct bowls on to, is this intentional or just testing two types? If so the one you've got on the R is the one to go with.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos». (La Luz Oscura, por Javier Guerrero)_\n\n"
