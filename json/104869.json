Thanks for this very constructive feedback...  \nLook, for the moment, I'm the only one that answered. I'm here to help (you in this case) but your answer makes me thinking you don't need it. Providing source helps, a lot, really... It could provide more samples (better quality, larger...), PDF, SWF... with earmarked letters that made the search possible.\n\n"
