  "content": "I’m looking for a modern typeface (probably sans) that connotes performance, leadership and entrepreneurship; if it looked a little techy that wouldn’t be such a bad thing.\n\nRight now, my closest faces are [Neo Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012145244/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=415110), [Interface](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012145244/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/interface/corp) and [Foco](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012145244/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/foco) ... [Trantino Bold Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012145244/http:/books.google.com/books?id=OR-HKs4ZvrAC&pg=RA1-PA291&lpg=RA1-PA291&dq=trantino+bold&source=web&ots=l1KCGKtmJR&sig=kkgHX6BpZMYmBZ8kqnPep_3uexw) is close but looks a little dated, unoriginal.\n\nIs there anything new or unexpected that someone can suggest.\n\nIt should be durable enough for web/motion graphics. This will be a brand’s primary typeface.\n\nThanks so much!\n\n [‹ gd ligature](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012145244/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40168 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fuse Magazine and D&AD ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012145244/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39718 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Can anyone think of one that would make a good brandmark (i.e. a little more distinction/personality) as well?\n\n"
