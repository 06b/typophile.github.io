  "content": "My brother Lars and me just recently agreed upon ‘Highway to Hell’ being the best rock album of all times (don’t argue!). Since he is an electronics engineer I had this idea for a T-shirt for him. But - it doesn’t seem to work out. Top has the tightness of the original but the L isn’t legible very well. Bottom: L is OK, but is it still AC/DC enough (too loose, L punches a hole)?  \nWhat do you think? Is it just a nice idea but doesn’t work out?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019053439im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LA-RS_TP_4482.jpg)\n\n",
