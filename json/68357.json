While this text in 'Arial Unicode MS' font gets rendered correctly in Firefox, IE, MS Word etc, text is rendered incorrectly in Photoshop CS3 (using the same font).\n\nPlease see visual differences in this image. Please scroll it horizontally.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402035002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/unicode-error-photoshop_3932.PNG)\n\nAnd irony is that this text is rendered correctly in 'layer name'. Please see this image.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402035002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/unicode-error-photoshop2_6717.PNG)\n\nI've also tried all the combinations available in 'opentype' menu but still no luck. In fact most of the options are grayed out. Please see this image.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402035002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/unicode-error-photoshop3_4143.PNG)\n\nIt truly seems some problem related to 'Ligatures' but only one ligature option ie 'Standard Ligatures' was available. Turning on/off that option didn't help either.\n\n",

That's it.\n\nThe result should look like this:\n\n[http://www.chillingeffects.de/temp4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402035002/http:/www.chillingeffects.de/temp4.jpg \"http://www.chillingeffects.de/temp4.jpg\")\n\n"
