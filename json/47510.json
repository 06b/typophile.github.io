  "content": "I work in a small market town that will remain nameless. Nameless not by my choice but by theirs. By “they” I am referring to the people that make up my town, namely my client-base. I guess choice is not the right phrase, choice implies a want or need. They allow this “small market” to stay as such: wallowing in anonymity while at the same time slowly murdering itself, slumped in a pool of its own miscalculated identity. People here are afraid of the edge or afraid of getting too close. This is a function of peoples hopes to homogenize our environment until everyone is in their “comfort zone” 100% of the time. “If we approach the edge it might make someone, not me of course, very uncomfortable and that is unacceptable.” Why? Do you really want everyone’s personal vision to be removed in exchange for one squeaky-clean, plastic sphere that happened to fit the consensus view. Thanks but no thanks. I like this old homeless dude; sleeping in my driveway by night and waving his penis at traffic by day. I enjoy that goth kid; oddly shaved and painted, buying the last newspaper. I love my grandmother; so “Leave it to Beaver” I want to kick myself in the throat. I love these people, but do i want to be like them? Hell No!  \nSomeday i’ll get right up on the edge, pull everyone in my “small market town” close together and we’ll jump. See you then.\n\n",
