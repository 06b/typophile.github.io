  "content": "I just got an email from Undeware (as I’m sure many of you did) about their crazy blackletter, Fakir, being chosen for the European version of _Rockband_. This is great news, as they do great work. However the real news is that as part of a contest they’re running, they’re giving away a free “rock version” of Fakir’s black weight for free download.\n\n[Check out their rocking front page with a link to more info and the font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706090841/http:/www.underware.nl/). Warning: audible rocking will commence upon click.\n\n [‹ Something for Endre](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706090841/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43645 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Adrian Frutiger - Frutiger Typeface ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706090841/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43794 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
