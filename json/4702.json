      "content": "1) It would be good to make this font in a way that it can be combined with a specific existing Latin font\\*, for projects that might use both scripts. This is because you need to worry about comparable color, apparent size, etc. This doesn't mean you have to mimic all the letterform structures though (in fact I think the opposite).   \n2) If this is a text face, I think your caps/lc proportion is way too big. In fact I believe the Cyrillic \"x-height\" needs to be bigger (relative to the Latin font you're matching). Predictably, the \"establishment\" disagrees with this (but I feel that's just Modernism's spell).   \n   \n\\* Unless you make you're own Latin too!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Capitals are higher than usual for cyrillic fonts; I plan to include a second lower-than-usual set to be used as \"small caps\", upright capitals for italic, and in Eric Gill's manner (high caps start paragraphs, low caps used in all other places). This should give enough flexibility for both pro- and contra-establishment uses.\n\n"
