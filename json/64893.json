  "content": "New licensing schemes have been launched for Andron. The idea behind is to stretch costs over time in order to keep the entrance price rather low.\n\nA special instalment plan is offered for students, who now can get started with Andron at incredible €45.\n\nAnother special license is adressed at publishers who edit scientific journals, and their authors.\n\nSince this kind of licensing is bound to handle a standing order payment it may be less interesting for those who don’t have a German bank account for the time being (banks tend to extra charge you for cross-border payment orders). Consequently the offerings [are presented here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018040725/http:/www.signographie.de/contenido/index.php?contenido=3b73786a570fca618bd224903f3141e9) in German by now. But I’m prepared to give any further explanation in English if required.\n\n",
