  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI have grown extremely fond of this style and want to use it for some identity work.\n\nAs I understand it, M.G.B. Patrician was designed by a man named Don Munson and originally used as transfer letters in 1982. However, it does not appear to have been made into a digital font by the owner of the rights (if anyone still owns it).\n\nAs of today, at least four publicly-available fonts were created based on M.G.B. Patrician: Mazama, Verve, Protea, and Aegina.\n\nAs there does not seem to be a commercial font based on this old typeface that I can use, could I legally use one of these fonts for an identity piece?\n\nThank you in advance for your replies, and don't worry, I don't expect any of you to be lawyers per say :)\n\n",

      "content": "Yes Don Munson is the designer. More info in a note from J-Louise Heron in a conversation with philippe2 (phillipedada) in the Myfonts forum (May, 2005):  \n---start quote---  \nDon Munson, former Art Director of Ballantine Books, NYC -- designed MGB Patrician. (The initials I believe were for him, his wife and partner, the Patrician for his daughter) At first it was a typositor exclusive at Haber. They would bill out 2 dollars a letter for each letter they set. Eventually, it was turned over to Letraset and made a rub on transfer - with those great alternative \"S\"s...  \nMr. Munson left his job - Haber’s shop moved into Image’s shop - and old man Haber, left the office one night - took 4 steps outside the door, had a heart attack, and was found dead on the floor later that night....  \n-- end quote --  \nMGB Patrician was published in the Letraset Product Manual with credit to MGB Communications Ltd.  \nThere are several independent digitizations.  \nI would not use the Steffaman version as in my opinion it is a rip of digital outlines created by another font maker. Mr. Steffmann's practice was to \"share\" fonts to which he had added characters and did some tinkering. Such fonts are not really his work. I have examined a good many of his fonts and often have been able to identify the source of his rip.  \nSimilarly Brendel's Aegina, and Opti's Protea are clones of each other (the old Chicken/Egg problem). Both of them have the same upper and lower case, with the swash caps and some other alternate glyphs in some very strange places (such as the trademark slot, etc.)  \nAbout the only digital M.G.B. Patrician legitimately available today that I can say with any confidence is an independent digitization of the Dan Munson design, is Mazema by James Harris [http://creativemarket.com/harristype/90257-Mazama-Regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150110153712/http:/creativemarket.com/harristype/90257-Mazama-Regular \"http://creativemarket.com/harristype/90257-Mazama-Regular\").  \nYou asked about \"legally use.\"  \nAs for legitimacy under intellectual property law, this varies from country to country. As you are located in the US, I will comment, as a non-lawyer, on the US rules. Digital outlines are protected under intellectual property law. The design of a font of type, in any form, can be protected for a limited number of years by applying for and receiving a design patent. AFAIK the design of M.G.B. Patrician was not patented. If you have concerns, don't take my word, but consult an IP lawyer.  \nDon\n\n"
