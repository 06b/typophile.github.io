It loosely reminds me of [Balmoral](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320224718/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/balmoral) and [Feel Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320224718/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/feel-script) but there might be a long way to get there starting from it. Some more I like for this job: [Yale FT](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320224718/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/yale), [Parfumerie Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320224718/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesenses/parfumerie-script-pro), [Shelley Script/English 111](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320224718/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/shelley+script) (probably my choice for customization), [Citadel Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320224718/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/atcitadel-script), [Lucia](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320224718/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lucia)\n\n"
