      "content": "This typeface has always interested me, so I took some trouble with this answer. The type the New Yorker uses is called 'Irvin' and you can see it on Page 184 of McGrew's book on \"American Metal Typefaces of the 20th Century\".\n\nI know of three digital versions (there were at least two film type versions): FF New Yorker, which has been mentioned; 'Manhattan' which was sold by Franklin Type Founders (now available only at Atomic Type); and David Rakowski's digitization called 'Upper West Side' (free at typOasis). The last is the only one of the three that faithfully recreates the true 'Q' from Irvin (in version 1.3 which is at typOasis. Rakowski's earlier version also had a bogus Q).\n\nI have made and posted an image with the posted sample for this thread, shown with samples of each of the three digital versions. See [http://bowfinprintworks.com/FaithFordType.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124044722/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/FaithFordType.html \"http://bowfinprintworks.com/FaithFordType.html\") (Yves, when is image posting coming back? Soon, I hope!) Based on the W, I would say the Faith Ford card uses Manhattan.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "I checked the Walden New Yorker font in detail, and I think the Walden version is a very slightly modified version of the early Rakowski font. The two Q's have identical shapes, but the Walden version uses more points. Since neither matched the original Q, this strikes me as more than odd.\n\nIn any case, neither of them was used for the Faith Ford card. I updated the [page I posted](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124044722/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/FaithFordType.html) to show a sample scanned from the McGrew book of Irvin as it existed in metal type form.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
