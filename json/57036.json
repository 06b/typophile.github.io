But there’s nothing wrong with that.\n\na little research shows Shani is a deaf artist ... that’s a pretty distinct point of difference. while everyone’s experience of the world are different hers is going to be totally different from the ’norm’ - presuming it’s the right Shani Marchant\n\nthanks re:ideas\n\n—————  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Graphic Designer](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134650/http:/www.solid-creative.com/)  \n [Short Film Festival](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134650/http:/www.showusyourshorts.com.au/)\n\n"
