  "content": "Hi Everyone,  \nI was wondering if you could help me with a typeface for a project. I did a logo for a project and was all set to go with it and then the name changed. I attached the previous logo.  \nThe new name needs to have capital and lowercase letters. I was wondering if anyone could suggest a good font for this. I like Foundry Gidnnik in medium or bold but I am lookig for something a bit more tough and militaryesque. The audience is the military and the feel for the project is \"security and stealth\" hence the first project name.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [stealth\\_logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20121130041510/http:/typophile.com/files/stealth_logo.png) | 1.63 KB |\n\n",

I could see \"stealth in a VERY light weight sans serif, but \"tough\" usually tends toward somwthing like Goudy Oldstyle extrabold; you might compromise on something like Glaser Stencil ( [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/glaser-stencil/](http://web.archive.org/web/20121130041510/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/glaser-stencil/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/glaser-stencil/\")), there's a \"rough\" version here too.\n\n"
