The one that spells ’les immatériaux’, not the Pompidou bit. Not sure if this was done by hand or not, but if anyone can spot it, that would be amazing.\n\nThank you!\n\n [‹ Font ID, please!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002010057/http:/typophile.com/node/49865 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Seal of Approval - Boomer Living ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002010057/http:/typophile.com/node/49853 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But you may want to have a look at [Emigre’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002010057/http:/www.emigre.com/) Citizen, Triplex and Lunatix all from the late 1980s for a similar flavor.\n\nOf course it may also be a font - in which case someone else may have just the perfect reply.\n\n"
