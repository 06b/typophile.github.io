It might be fun to make your white space (the breaks) in the characters a little thicker--just to see how much the letter can handle it--make it more stencil-like.

I know they seem alike, but since I basically cut and pasted all the characters from a few parts, I was wondering if I should take a new stand on them. I had a lot of troubles with the B and the D, trying to incorporate the same stem weight and bottom look-a-like serif with the break in it. Any ideas? thanks for the feedback.   \nI enjoy my numbers too! ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023194332im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

This character is   \nunique among the others. Perhaps this idea   \ncould be used on the \"N\", \"H\", \"A\".   \n   \nThe \"T\" and to a lesser extent the \"i\" are also   \nunique in that they seem to be the only glyphs   \nto have what could be conventional serifs.   \nMaybe these characters should change or   \nperhaps their characteristics should be   \nexploited elsewhere.   \n   \nThe more I look at it the more I like it however,   \nkeep working on it.   \n   \n-smc\n\n"

I actually thought my R stood out from the rest and didn't look uniform with the others. I like your idea of incorporating the same concept with other characters, so i'll and give it a shot!
