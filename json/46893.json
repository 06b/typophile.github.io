      "content": "There are two typefaces in the Stephenson, Blake & Co specimen, third edition (ca. 1920s) that have the appellation of \"Runic.\" One is called Lining Bold Runic; the other is Lining Runic Elongated. Monotype's Runic Condensed is closely related to the latter. But these weren't a unified family and have only some shared stylistic traits.\n\nThe concept of a unified family of weights and widths was only just taking shape at that time period and was not all-pervasive. Off-beat styles like this didn't usually get the \"family treatment.\"\n\nSo I doubt that Monotype ever had a unified family of Runic styles. I believe there was only ever this one.\n\nWhy the \"Condensed\" in the name? I believe that Runic was used as a generic style designation -- like Latin or Egyptian. So this is Monotype's interpretation of a condensed, Runic-style typeface.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
