      "content": "Well, the problem with \"Oblique\" is that in the styling group aka Windows family naming, you should only use terms \"Regular\", \"Italic\", \"Bold\", \"Bold Italic\". So in OpenType fonts, you won't get around the \"Italic\" term anyway. If it's called Italic in Word for Windows, I guess it is simpler if it would be also called on the other platforms. Similarly, I recommend not to defer from the other standard style names (\"Regular\", \"Bold\", \"Bold Italic\") for those styles, if possible. Of course for the more extensive families, other styles need to carry other names which then won't be compatible with the styling group names, but I think for the basic four fonts, it is best if the typographic names (i.e. OpenType family and style name) and the styling group names (i.e. Windows family and style name) are the same.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "em,\n\nin general, it is a question of how much we \"educate\" the users by adhering to traditional, typographic terminology (here, the term \"oblique\" \\_might\\_ be all-right, although your particular typeface is not obviously oblique, just as it is not obviously italic), vs. how much we make it easy for the users to just stick to what they commonly know. I guess for an average graphic designer, the difference between \"oblique\" and \"italic\" is not obvious, and in some languages it simply does not exist. For example in German or in Polish, the inclined counterpart to an upright typeface is simply called kursiv/kursywa, and most users have a 1:1 translation in mind (kursiv/kursywa = italic). \"Oblique\" may seem to them as an overcomplication.\n\nIn addition to that, the former argument I made about cross-application \"compatibility\" of menu names applies. This argument does not, however, mean, that we are bound to make 4-styles families. You can make larger typographic families, with appropriate naming that groups any number of styles under one family name, for Mac and OpenType-aware/Adobe applications, and on top of that, produce styling groups with up to 4 styles. An updated description of the process is available on [the FontLab forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101652/http:/forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-tips-and-tricks/font-family-naming-in-fontlab-studio-5-t313.0.html). But still, \\*within\\* those two naming systems, I think it is advantageous to use the same terms as much as possible, i.e. \"Bold\" should be \"Bold\" and \"Italic\" should be \"Italic\". In other words, I think it is best when the four \"basic\" styles of the large family have the same typographic and styling names (while for the other styles, the naming must differ, naturally).\n\nBut that's just my opinion. I think every designer or foundry needs to make that decision themselves.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "I believe that for most font users, the English term \"italic\" just like the German term \"kursiv\" or Polish \"kursywa\" no longer describes a certain structural phenomenon, but rather a functional. I'd say that the most common definition given by an average user for \"italic\" would be that it's an inclined/slanted counterpart of the upright font in a font family. If you click on the \"I\" button in an application, it is labeled \"Italic\", no matter whether the actual font that it turns on is \"italic\" or \"cursive\" or \"oblique\". So Italic ends up being the most generic term.\n\nI myself would prefer if \"cursive\" and \"oblique\" became additional qualifiers that are used \\_in conjuction\\_ with the term \"Italic\". So one could have an \"oblique italic\" and a \"cursive italic\". Functionally, both are italics, but structurally, one is oblique and the other cursive. In other words, \"cursive\" and \"oblique\" are two extrema on one axis that is called italicness. That's how I see it.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"

The former is structurally different than the upright, the latter is structurally identical with the upright but slanted (in which respect the type in question would rather qualify as Oblique than italic, regardless of the one-storey 'a'). Italic Oblique does not make sense because Oblique is not Italic nor a subset of it.\n\nTechnically, Italic is better 'supported' so it is the preferred choice. Yet WPF does distinguish both, and on the level of WWS-compatible names would allow a family to have both Italic and Oblique style. Which however gets one into an odd situation when it comes to the four-style 'styling group' level. Obliques would need to become a separate family ... So for practical reasons, stick to Italic.\n\n"

But many current users follow a simplified functional definition, which is that oblique does not exist and italic is the inclined companion to an upright typeface.\n\nIn fact, both are somewhat true. For example, Robert Slimbach's Poetica structurally is an italic but functionally it isn't. So by many users, it is treated as a \"roman\" face.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"

Whether it's Oblique or Cursive, functionally it's the same effect your looking for in a non-upright version. Besides, everyone is familiar with 'Italic' and I think the confusion lies more so with the term 'Oblique', so between that and the platform issue I'd say Italic has a much stronger case (pun intended : P) to be used for naming non-upright versions… even if the type in question is truly an Oblique, or any of the shades of grey between that and a true Italic, right?\n\n"

You may start from the roman as a model, but you don’t have to as long as the two blends well together.\n\nIf you change forms (double-storey ‘a’ to single-storey), thus hinting a more calligraphic approach, then calling it an _italic_ would be more apt.
