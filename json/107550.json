I've used the same naming structure in another font and it worked just fine but on this one it isn't working, it displays both styles in different families.\n\nI've attached the images of the settings of each style.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2013-12-03 at 14.44.13.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414184934/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-03%20at%2014.44.13.png) | 108.55 KB |\n| [Screen Shot 2013-12-03 at 14.44.18.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414184934/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-03%20at%2014.44.18.png) | 83.96 KB |\n| [Screen Shot 2013-12-03 at 14.44.25.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414184934/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-03%20at%2014.44.25.png) | 108.18 KB |\n| [Screen Shot 2013-12-03 at 14.44.31.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414184934/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-03%20at%2014.44.31.png) | 82.85 KB |\n\n",
