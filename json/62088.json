It includes theme park, web, PR, and promos. But I didn’t see it on stuffs designed by the New York team (news, daytime program).\n\n\\*nbc site’s meta tag, author: NBC.com Web Development/Engineer Team\n\nNote that NBC Universal is a subsidiary branch of GE. A company with their own teams of designers and uses multiple agencies. So I could be totally wrong.\n\nHere are the screen shot of the nbc site for prosperity\n\n[website](http://web.archive.org/web/20091009055419/http:/www.jwchen.com/share/nbcindex.png)  \n [promotions a](http://web.archive.org/web/20091009055419/http:/www.jwchen.com/share/nbcpromo.png)\n\npromotional posters  \n [band 1 - donnas](http://web.archive.org/web/20091009055419/http:/www.jwchen.com/share/nbcdonnas.jpg)  \n [band 2 - peter, bejorn, john](http://web.archive.org/web/20091009055419/http:/www.jwchen.com/share/nbcjohn.jpg)\n\n"

IMO, it looks much better in broadcast than it does on the web (where it already looked pretty nice). it’s a great fit for their light-hearted comedy focus. congratulations, Nick! maybe we’ll start seeing it in the MyFonts Rising Stars newletters!\n\n"
