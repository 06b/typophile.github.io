      "content": "The distance between the P and the R is slightly too big as well IMHO, but do the spacing around the O first and see if it still is. Try squinting while looking at the logo and see if it \"breaks up\" into separate words, if it does, the letters where it breaks up are too far apart compared to the others. Also try turning it upside down, sideways, looking at it from at great distance etc., helps you see kerning problems.\n\n"

Thanks and let me know.\n\nHappy new year!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804200458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ProfeyLogoType_beta2_6660.gif)\n\n"

The angled stroke of the P and R seems to be a touch clumsy where the curve meets the straight it perhaps needs to be thicker.  \nTim\n\n"
