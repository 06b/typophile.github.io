  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI'm a graphic design student and a relatively new user of FontLab Studio 5. I'm currently working on a typeface in Fontlab Studio that I'm hoping to release commercially. A tutor suggested that I should try to see if I can export the final OpenType/TrueType files in a 'locked' format, to prevent others from being able to easily open, edit and rerelease the typeface. However, as a beginner I don't yet know how to do this in FontLab Studio.\n\nAny instructions would be gratefully received,\n\nMany thanks,\n\nJoe\n\n",
