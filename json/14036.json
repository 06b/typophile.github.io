Being more recent than the other main [TeX](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724062454/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TeX) macro package, [LaTeX](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724062454/http:/typophile.com/wiki/LaTeX), it is both more modular in its conception and more monolithic in its building.\n\nThis system was developed from 1990 by Hans Hagen from PRAGMA Advanced Document Engineering (Pragma ADE), a Netherlands-based company.\n\nFor more on ConTeXt, see the wiki:\n\n[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main\\_Page](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724062454/http:/wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page \"http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main\\_Page\")\n\n",
