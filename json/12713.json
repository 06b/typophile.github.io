There are some brush lettering artists who might do something similar or even mimic the style faithfully, but you will not get the same wiggly feeling from type. Look up Jill Bell, John Downer, Michael Clark, Carl Rohrs, and other brush letterers. Support lettering artists! There are effects you can’t get with type.\n\nCarl\n\n"
