The latter is probably best served by widely-spaced, monoline sans-serifs, for instance, but the former by contrasting seriffed fonts.\n\nHere are some rather random notes on what makes for readability: they're hardly the product of research, and may all be nonsense.\n\nThink of pattern not rhythm - i.e. robust and taut white shapes, not stem distance regularity.\n\nConstruction of stems, bowls, counters, cross-bars, diagonals, and how they join matters more than detailing.\n\nLimited but clear contrast assists differentiation and adds life, about 3 or 4:1 being ideal.\n\nDifferentiation within a small range in many aspects of the design will obliterate a consistent chirography; however chirography provides two (broad and pointed pen) admirable starting points for design, and since real calligraphy is never so geometric as, say, Minion one can learn from it especially once one has internalised the effects of miniaturisation.\n\nVariety matters especially around the top of the x-height.\n\nbpdq bowl-height should be apparently less than o's height.\n\nVary axes for differentiation, both exterior versus other exterior axes and interior versus exterior axes.\n\nVary textures for interior and exterior outlines: rigid and angular in one, rounded in the other.\n\nBasic forms may be selectively differentiated by e.g. giving c 16th-century Roman capital serifs, or e a terminal beak, or h a rounder right leg than n.\n\nText lowercase baseline serifs should be only minimally cupped, if at all. The primary purpose of lowercase serifs is to limit lateral interference: they should be long and strong. Near-equilateral triangles are not good enough.\n\nPerceived blackness flows into stems from intersections and serifs; smooth colour-gradations require the management of intersections. Thus the horizontals of n and m should meet the left stem immediately below the serif.\n\nDistance between stems of n and m should be a touch smaller at the bottom than the top if the characters are not to seem inflated by the open counter at the bottom.\n\nThere should be no superfluous neural spiking in reading - the text should be transparent. Difficult letter-combinations, such as gg and ra, may be ligatured.\n\nx-height for 12 point should be about 55% of h-height, and descender length about 55% to 75% of ascender length.\n\nExamples of quasi-Aldine proportions: `\n----------------16 pt---11 pt---8 pt\nx-height--------4.5-----5-------5.5\nItalic Cap------5.5-----6-------6.5\nRoman Cap-------6.5-----7-------7.5\nh-height--------7.5-----8-------8.5\np-height--------7.5-----7.5-----7.5\nLeading---------1.5-----1.5-----1.5\n`\n\nIn small text, small irregularities, white and black, should be relatively larger.\n\nBoth nearest points and stem-distance matter in spacing. At 12 point, optical space between characters should be about three quarters of that within the characters' counters. At 8 point it should be about seven eighths.\n\n"

Why? Because I think that as a practical matter there are a lot of legible, readable type faces and there is more to be learned by paying attention to the aesthetic differences between them in relation to what one wants to communicate.\n\nMy example was to show that it is quite important practically how readable a typeface is--something I thought, perhaps mistakenly, you rejected in the above quotations.\n\nA person designing a typeface intended for text should, I think, be extremely concerned about its readability. Otherwise it is going to be a bad text face. For the text type designer it should not be a 'non-existent problem'.\n\nAnd similarly when a graphic designer sets extended text, he or she should be concerned that the typeface and the layout together are readable. And this involves looking at both the qualities of the typeface and the layout, both of which will contribute to readability or detract from it. It is not a trivial problem to produce readable text, I think, particularly when the designer also needs to be addressing the production and aesthetic demands of a text to be printed.\n\nAesthetics are interesting and important, but it seems to me readability is also at least equally worth focusing on for extended text.

Many of us have done at least a fair job explaining why/that serifs help reading; certainly a much better job than the self-serving hackneyed droning of the Emigre mantra, or the cloying cultural over-valuation of poets.\n\n\\> aesthetics and readability, except where there is a  \n\\> deliberate decision to divorce the two, are co-incident.\n\nPoppycock.  \nLife isn't so one-dimensional.\n\n\\> that is not a difficult thing to learn.\n\nOn the contrary, it's so difficult that even over  \na century after Javal's discovery we're fumbling.\n\nHoly Grail?

      "content": "Hi hrant,\n\nThanks so much for explaning to me that I shouldn't set Moby Dick in Gill Sans. Until you came to my rescue, I was on the verge of making a big mistake.\n\nHow about if I set it in Eaglefeather? That way I could make an oblique reference to the close relationship between Herman Melville and Frank Lloyd Wright, which everyone knows about seein' as how Wright had a copy of Moby Dick in his library. Besides, they were both Americans.\n\nIf you don't like that idea, how about Cheltenham? I hear that it is even better than Times Roman. I also hear that the New York Times has recently decided to use Cheltenham, and New York isn't all that far from where Moby Dick starts off, although I'll admit that there aren't a lot of big white/albino killer whales in the Hudson River.\n\nHow much would it cost me to hire you to do some empirical research to figure out this problem, especially figuring out the most legible/readable type? I'm especially concerned because when Moby Dick got published, it was a good deal less successful than the Da Vinci Code, and I figure that you might be able to explain why Dan Brown's book is a hit and Melville's book was a bust.\n\nYours in anticipation, and with an open chequebook,\n\nredge\n\nPS. I agree that Cuba is boring, but as you point out it is relevant. Hemmingway's old man, unlike Melville's guy, managed to catch his fish. You can see what I am up against, trying to publish a book about a fisherman who can't catch worth a damn.\n\n"

But of course, change the subject, a convenient distraction.\n\nBTW, I don't know where you get the idea I think those faces are good for text. I've never used or recommended Mrs Eaves.

If one has spent many years acquiring a refined sensibility, and non-practitioners seek to quantify that in a banal manner, there's reason enough for hostility, protecting your turf. Especially when a company like Microsoft is involved -- your favourite bugbear, middle aged Anglo creatives, are all too familiar with the way hard-earned skills have been replaced by automated software.\n\nWhat does the future hold in store? Already MS is touting the scientifically-proven readability benefits of its ClearType faces in marketing language, so who needs a typographer to spec a typeface when the engineer can tell the client what works best?\n\n"
