I've created numbers 0-9, and the circle, and then am using those elements as components to create larger numbers within the circles (37, 45, etc.)\n\nSome work fine, but none of my 1s or 3s are showing up as components. Nothing looks different about those particular glyphs in comparison to others. Any ideas?\n\nthanks!\n\nJonathan\n\n",
