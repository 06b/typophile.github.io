  "content": "For my Typography class, I am creating an alphabet book (similar to a child’s) that basically gives a timeline of fonts and typefaces from the year 1950 - 2000.\n\nMy goal is to find 5 fonts from each decade between these years and outline a basic history of each. (50’s, 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, and a year 2000 page)\n\nThis is not a commercial endeavor - however, depending on the final product, it could be. As such, if you provide me with a link, an article, etc. that helps me accomplish this goal, I will include your name in an Acknowledgements section.\n\nThanks for any help! I will be scanning the finished book upon completion so you can see.\n\n [‹ Chaparral-like fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102112224/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38561 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Time for a change ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102112224/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38425 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
