  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI have designed three fonts recently in FontLab, a family of reg/ita (A-B), plus one other font (C).\n\nWhen I generate OT fonts and install on my Mac via Fontbook, all is normal, but on my laptop, fontbook gives me a warning that the fonts are corrupt and may crash the system. I have ignored it and installed, and the fonts work normally.\n\nWhen I mailed the fonts to my laptop instead of transferring on a USB keyring, there was no warning.\n\nI then mailed the fonts to two friends. One, using Fontbook, installed the A-B font without any problems but got a crash warning on the C font. The other friend, using Suitcase, installed the C font painlessly whereas the A-B font did not show up at all in Suitcase.\n\nIn short, problems seem to occur randomly. Can anybody help?\n\nRegards, Per JÃ¸rgensen\n\n",
