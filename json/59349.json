  "content": "Letraset had an experiment some twenty years ago which drove users crazy. To protect their software, they had programmed the fonts to be installed only 5 times. After that they were, like, _dead._ I remember FontShop had the occasional hysterical customer saying “I’ve installed it 4 times already and it’s still not working, I’ve only got one chance left!” Needless to say, the experiment was never taken up in the industry.\n\nDoes anybody have more precise information about this technology, and did this font format have a specific name?\n\n",

I wonder how difficult it would be to embed licensing restrictions in fonts, similar to songs you would download from iTunes, where the font can only be authorized on however many computers at a time. Am I missing some obvious reason for not doing something like that?\n\n"

What’s wrong with rich people like them to spare a poor guy like me?”\n\nUnfortunately, people also wrongly identify the font design industry as one of those who makes tons of money, since most people don’t have a clue about font design business and they think that anything to do with IT business make lots of money.\n\nI know at least that is the mentality of many who lives in this part of the world- ASIA, where piracy are rampant!\n\nLegal enforcement and education from the government sometimes help in my country.\n\nweng\n\n"
