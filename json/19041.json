  "content": "I would like to find a replacement for DTL Argo, which, as you know, is rather expensive selection. If you would have recommendations? Weights I need are medium and black, as well as respective obliques.  \nArgo looks like this: [http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Images/Argo%20Black%201.GIF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321004831/http:/www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Images/Argo%20Black%201.GIF \"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Images/Argo%20Black%201.GIF\")\n\nI would like to use a font that has \"normal\" or inexpensive price. I did find a free one from [www.dafont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321004831/http:/www.dafont.com/ \"www.dafont.com\") called Communist (that is inexpensive indeed: [http://www.dafont.com/communist.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321004831/http:/www.dafont.com/communist.font \"http://www.dafont.com/communist.font\") ), but it's obliques are not suitable and some are even missing, also some problems with characters.\n\n",
