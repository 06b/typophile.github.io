It’s taught by a more fine-arts oriented instructor, so I get the feeling there will be more loose exploration and technical craft and less typographic stricture. So, I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a first-timer on a letterpress: what to try, what do you enjoy most about using it, how do you design for the letterpress, your experiences, anything. I’m hoping to really dig in and get my hands dirty (in the figurative and literal senses) when the time comes.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

You only need a kiss impression. Make sure the packing has been changed to get even impression. We used to do kerning with a bandsaw on big type but there was plenty of it in those days.

If that’s what you’re into.\n\nIf you’re going the metal type route, try to leaf through a copy of Geoffrey Dowding’s _Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type_. If the instructor is more of a fine arts bent, I’d doubt that they’ll delve too deeply into that realm of spacing.\n\nIf they don’t supply paper, make sure you get something decent to print on. I’ve had good luck in the past with Mohawk, Neenah, Cougar, and French. Past that, there’s always the pricier fine art papers (Arches, BFK, Stonehenge, etc.).\n\nAnd as Chris says, be sure you’re not packed too tight (esp. if you’re using cover weight stock).\n\nAnd, of course, have a ball.\n\n"

But the “more fine-arts oriented instructor” is something that raises a red flag for me in this respect: murderous impression depth is sadly considered more artsy.\n\nPaper: I’ve used BFK for “presentation” pieces, but if you’re interested in getting honest, super sharp black-on-white printing (as I generally am) you know what works amazingly well? Inkjet paper! And it’s cheaper. I’ve had the best luck with Epson’s “Matte Paper Heavyweight”.\n\nhhp\n\n"

But at the same time, it’ll break me out of my very conventions-oriented mindest a little and I won’t judge until I’m doing it. I’m looking for a nice balance: nice meaty, deep impressions of funky forms and big type, along with some well set, well printed text. We’ll see. This is also a way for me to argue getting a Kelsey,(or the like) some time in the future. Damned if we have the space, but that’s not really the point, is it?\n\nHrant, it makes sense that Epson’s heavyweight matte is good for printing. On my 880i inkjet, the blacks are so rich and lush they’re velvety.\n\n"

I got to set and print a line of metal type in the first class, which was slipped into a pre-fab lockup and printed. I really enjoyed it. I had no idea how…disorienting?…it would feel. I think of type as this flexible mesh, a fabric that can be stretched and pulled on the computer (no, I don’t scale my type). The solid, immutable nature of the metal type (especially if you only have one size) is so foreign to me, but also kind of…reassuring? Knowing that x word in x font will be x picas wide and that’s what you have to work with is simultaneously annoying and really nice. It creates solid design posts around which you need to slalom; it limits the variables. The downside is the kerning. I’m not sure how much (if any) adjustment I’m permitted to make (to letters like ‘T’, for example) to the University’s type.\n\nThe teacher doesn’t push typography on us, but is very open to my attention to it and has kind of tagged me as the ‘expert’ for letter spacing. I’m still trying to figure out where the character palette is to adjust the kerning on the Vandercook. ;)\n\nAnyway, I’m bringing my camera in and hopefully I can post some photos from the UArts shop. I don’t have enough experience to say whether it’s a good or an OK shop, but it’s got a nice selection of faces (metal and wood) and seems well-organized.\n\nAgain, thanks for the tips. Hopefully, I’ll be able to post my composition for critique in the next week or two.\n\n"

Punctuation seems to be my weakness. I’m learning the value of a clean type surface.

What was most spooky about the experience was that for many seconds after it happened I was thinking “Damn, I have to start over”; but then the much worse reality, “Oh my god, I’ve damaged this wonderful type”, gave me a body blow, and I alternated between chalk-white and fire-engine red for about an hour.\n\nhhp\n\n"
