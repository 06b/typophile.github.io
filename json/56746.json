  "content": "Welcome to the first newsletter this year! :)\n\nCheapProFonts is constantly growing, and we’re now spreading our wings a bit: some of our fonts are now also available on MyFonts - and more are on their way! :)  \nBecause of this I had to spend some time preparing new files and graphics etc. so the releases of new reworked fonts has been a bit further between - but I still keep a respectable pace.\n\nIn this news release I present the following 9 fonts:  \n- 3 from Ronna Penner  \n- 2 from Ray Larabie  \n- 1 from Nick Curtis  \n- 1 from Brian Kent  \n- 1 from Kimberly Geswein  \n- 1 from myself! ;)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090814213310im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/CheapProFonts-NEWS-09-01_5176.gif)\n\nBecause of a recent policy change by Microsoft (and others) regarding the encoding of Romanian I have started updating all the released fonts to make them compatible with this practice. This updating will continue inbetween new releases.\n\nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting “foreign” languages (languages requiring more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.  \nCheck our site for constant new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\n\nRoger S.
