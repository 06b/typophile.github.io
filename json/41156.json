I do design and maybe i would go to that detail!\n\nFutura it isnt we can even compare with the font on the right side the N and the M. What can you tell me about that?\n\nThanks for all\n\nJoel Santos // youremin  \nsound & visual\n\n"

Oh, well.\n\n_what specifications on those letters did you find... revealing?_\n\nJoel, in the word “PRO-PAGANDA” I looked at the tail of the R (i.e., where does it join the bowl?), the way the stems of the A join at the top, and the vertical stroke and horizontal terminal of the G...
