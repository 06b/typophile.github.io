  "content": "Do you know where/how the standard metal type sizes originated (8, 10, 12, 14, 16...24, 32, 36, etc.), and why those sizes? I can speculate but would like to read an historian's (or type nerd's) perspective. Lawson doesn't mention anything in \"Anatomy of a Typeface.\" Perhaps Updike? Thanks for any light you can shed, or direction you can send me.\n\n",

      "content": "The sizes are mostly multiple of 6 or 12 (32 was not standard--it should be 30 in your list). 6 points is half a pica and 12 points is one pica, so basically it made the math easier. Below 18 point there are sizes that are not multiples of 6, but for practical reasons it was necessary to have finer steps.\n\n"
