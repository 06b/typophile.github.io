  "content": "Hey all,\n\nI'm a design student taking my first serious stab at type design.  \nThis is hard work and I'm getting a little overwrought. I thought I'd take  \na break and post what I've got so far on the \"chopping block\" as it were.\n\nI know there are big issues with the face so far, but, let's talk about  \n'em and how I can improve the set. I have only developed what you see  \nhere so far. I am trying for a humanist face _LOOSELY_ rooted in Gill Sans.  \nThe principle design elements are the curved slab serifs and the stroke  \ntaper at the connections.\n\nSay what you will; let's get these letters into shape!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713230756im_/http:/typophile.com/files/baby_face_5377.png)\n\nThanks,  \nRachel\n\n",

      "content": "Wow, this looks incredibly a lot like a sign I hand lettered for the school that I work in and I was thinking about how it'd look nice as a font. You beat me to it haha\n\nAnyways, the flat descenders and ascenders I really like. I wonder if you might be able to pull out the j and the f and make them a bit longer, same for the p and the q. The almost mechanical look is what gives it its character, play with it some more. Also you might try making the serif a bit smaller on the b or the d (or both). Because they almost connect with the bowl, the serifs look much heavier. It doesn't seem to be a problem for the r, probably because of it's more horizontal approach to the stem.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

It seems to have great potential. I can see a fantastic display version as well as a functional text version.\n\n"
