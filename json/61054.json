  "content": "Hi,\n\ni would like some suggestions from you experts about some good typefaces i can consider for the blog of a journalist.\n\nI think will go with a classic grid/typographic style (eg. shauninman.com, subtraction.com) but i want to avoid a newspaper look.\n\nThe blog need to be authoritative but modern (not trendy) but i'd like a little injection of a classic feeling (maybe the coupling of a serif and a sans-serif?).\n\nI am open to all your suggestions, if you feel you need more details to help me let me know, and I will try to provide.\n\nThanks in advance,  \nGiuliano\n\n",

      "content": "I will try to keep it short:\n\nI work as front-end developer and also a bit as designer for the web from 5 years.\n\nFrom this autumn I will go freelance to cultivate my other old passion: writing & journalism.\n\nI will collaborate professionally with a newspaper and a magazine but I want to have a blog too, where writing freely about themes I care.\n\nThe blog will host posts about my interests: sociology, philosophy, politics & literature. Mainly editorials, opinions and some reviews of books I read.\n\nI want to give the site a very minimal and effective design with usability & legibility in mind, BUT i don't want the blog to feel too classic or newspaper-like (a thing that often happens when going to the grid&typography classic look on the web).\n\nI would like the site to look modern BUT not trendy (not something that could feel outdated a year or two from now).\n\nOther weblogs i like are: [wilsonminer](http://web.archive.org/www.wilsonminer.com) and [informationarchitects](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308183624/http:/informationarchitects.jp/).\n\nMaybe (not sure still) I will go for very big type (16px) for article body copy (only on the page of the single post), in this case a serif font will be needed for the body copy (again only on the single post page).\n\nI hope i gave you enoguh information.\n\nGiuliano\n\n"

I'd take a look at [Eudald](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308183624/http:/www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=88), which is distantly related (Farnham is loosely based on the types of Johann Fleischmann, while Eudald is a revival of his Spanish imitator Eudald Pradell's types. The web page doesn't mention OT versions of the typefaces, but I know Mário Feliciano started working on them more than a year ago. They're probably finished long ago now).\n\n"

It might perhaps not be the best choice for copious amounts of small text. And you need an OpenType font, I don't know Morgan is converted yet. Send an e-mail and ask, and ask for an extensive specimen, too.\n\n"

      "content": "Base your decision on how the face looks in an online type tester, for reasons such as the fact that sifr does not support kerning or tracking.\n\nSo the display styles of [Brown Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308183624/http:/www.shinntype.com/brown.html) might be good for a sans headline, as they are tightly fitted.\n\nOther Shinntype news faces with display styles: Nicholas, Pratt, Walburn, Worldwide.\n\nAnd I would say, make your headlines big, using display faces, because it will create a more sophisticated quality than what people are used to when they see default web faces blown up.\n\n"
