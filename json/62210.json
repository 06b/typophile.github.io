I need it to be total overkill, kind of like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141002102410im_/http:/typophile.com/files/NO_4977.gif)\n\n... or even more insane, if that's possible. I know a lot of this kind of lettering isn't digitized, so I've had a hard time finding what I need.\n\n"

There must be books in a library near you with this, perhaps a scan or a good photocopy would get you going? The original copyright would most likely be expired and if you set your own text with the letters (rather than reproducing a whole page of the book), you would (caveat: I'm not a lawyer, please check) not breach the publisher's copyright on the book.\n\n"
