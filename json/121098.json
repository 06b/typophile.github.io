      "content": "Hello, Nick.\n\nIn general the font is ok, although I suppose it is designated for several countries whose alphabet is based on the cyrillic one. Knowing only the Russian alphabet, I was wondering which letters are after the capital Щ and which are the last 3 uppercase letters?  \nIf after the capital Щ is Ъ, then it was quite difficult to recognize it, for me personally. Because its shape looks more to Б, which is a quite readable letter in your font. But when you meet the Ъ (after seeing Б) it is a bit confusing. Also, it doesn't look like Ь. Shouldn't the design of these 2 letters (Ь and Ъ) be quite similar ? Maybe other users have a different opinion...  \nBy the way, for which purposes the font is being designed? It takes some effort for me to read the lowercase part.\n\n"

I have now based the shapes of Ъ and Ь on the Б as you said that was the most readable:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416034228im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Cyrb's_6220.png)\n  \nAre these better?\n\nIt would be a great help if you could paste a paragraph containing all Russian Cyrillic characters (if that's possible) if you post again, then you would be able to see how characters look in the context of words.\n\nSomebody else said \"Very odd П, г, н, ь, ъ & I don't really like Л, ы, у. The Serbian letters are incorrect. Because it's a script, it must either have Serbian cursive alternates for г, п, т, ш or have no Serbian glyphs at all, just not to confuse people.\"\n\nShould the П and Л have a crossbar at the top between the two vertical stems? I've looked through many handwriting samples and all that I have seen are shown without.\n\nThis is going to be used for advertising. Thanks for your help.\n\n"

      "content": "Dear Nick,\n\n1. The letters above could be one variant. Do me a favor, please, and try to make Ъ based on your first displayed Ь. And leave Б as it is in the first version. I like the bowl of first Ь much more than the second one.  \n2. Text in Russian (have in mind that I substituted 2 letters, ь-ъ е-ё because I cannot find now a text containing them, thus some words are displayed intentionally wrong ):  \nОкончив газету, вторую чашку кофе и калач с маслом, он встал, стряхнул крошки калача с жилета и, расправив широкую грудь, радостно улыбнулся, не оттого, что у него на душе было что-то особенно приятное, — радостную улыбку вызвало хорошее пищеварение.  \nНо эта радостная улыбка сейчас же напомнила ему все, и он задумался.  \nДва детские голоса (Степан Аркадьич узнал голоса Гриши, меньшого мальчика, и Тани, старшей дёвочки) послышались за дверъми. Они что-то везли и уронили.  \n— Я говорила, что на крышу нелъзя сажать пассажиров, — кричала по-английски дёвочка, — вот подбирай!  \n«Все смешалось, — подумал Степан Аркадьич, — вон дети одни бегают». И, подойдя к двери, он кликнул их.  \n3. 1. Uppercase П is just fine, lowercase...hm... I've seen it like this too, but you can make it like the capital one. Would be more reliable.  \n3.2. Yes, maybe lowercase г is too much like uppercase. I usually make it like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416034228im_/http:/typophile.com/files/g_4949.png)\n  \n3.3. Л - just fine. It is a matter of taste. Why you do not like it?  \n3.4. ы, у ... yeah, but since it is a script font, why don't you make several versions of letters and they could be used randomly within the text. That is to say, in a paragraph you could have 2 different ы or у and thus you reinforce the meaning of a script font.  \n3.5. Cannot express my opinion about Serbian, but surely there is no need to restrict yourself. Include Serbian too and talk to some other people about it.  \n4. \"Should the П and Л have a crossbar at the top between the two vertical stems?\"  \nWhat do you mean? Show me an example, please... \n"

      "content": "Nick, you have some good advisers here, so do not worry about your blindness:) You will regain your sight :)  \nJan is right concerning the letters н + п. Although п seems quite ok for me, н is indeed difficult to recognize.  \nAnd Maxim gave you a good example of a script font.  \nNow, you said earlier, that the purpose of your font is to be used in advertisement. Is it about one word or few, or a whole paragraph? If it's about the last one, than I have to say that it is quite difficult to read a passage set with your font. It is like a mature hand is learning to write... Which actually, is you, trying to write in Russian. And because its not your native language, of course, it is more difficult than for a native one. Maxim's script is flowing and the letters do not disturb my brain from reading the paragraphs.\n\nReferring to your font:  \n1. What if your characters would be designed with the same or almost the same x-height? Maybe, the reading would be easier than. It depends on your final goal: what you are trying to achieve?  \n2. When the height is different between the left and right part of the same character, the reading becomes even more difficult. Take a look at the following 2 words, узнал +улыбку, how the characters are displayed.  \nBut if you could manage a similar height of characters (nr.1), maybe nr. 2 could be avoided... Again, it depends on how many words will be displayed on the advertisement.  \nAnd by the way, what \"character\" would you like to give to your font?  \nSimilar font was designed by Parachute, [http://www.parachute.gr/typefaces/allfonts/libera-pro#Cyrillic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416034228/http:/www.parachute.gr/typefaces/allfonts/libera-pro#Cyrillic \"http://www.parachute.gr/typefaces/allfonts/libera-pro#Cyrillic\")  \ncheck all 3 languages: Russian, Greek, Latin.  \nYou see, the height of letters is different, and even the hight of left+right parts of characters varies sometimes. Of course, you are not going to read whole passages set with this font, but in Greece it became extremely popular in ad sector. It is widely used for packages. Even, during local elections, the banners were displayed with Libera.\n\n"
