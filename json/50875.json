[Public Lettering](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222050153/http:/www.publiclettering.org.uk/) – a walk in London by [Phil Baines](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222050153/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Phil%2520Baines). Lots of good stuff on [Stadtgespräche](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222050153/http:/www.stadtgespraeche.com/) aswell.  \nBut my favourite link is [Jules Vernacular](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222050153/http:/www.vernacular.fr/).  \nMore links in the [Typebase](http://web.archive.org/web/20100222050153/http:/www.typebase.com/).  \nF\n\n"
