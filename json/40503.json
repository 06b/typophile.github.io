Very Neturafacesque.\n\nI wonder if the building originally housed a company called ANAR, who went bankrupt, and the new tenant figured they’d save a few bucks and just based their name of the existing signage. ;o)\n\n(In fact, I know I’ve seen examples like that...companies moving in to existing building and basing their new name on part of the old signage...that’d make for a good blog.)\n\n"
