Is it that the serif makes the shape differ more from **I** and **l** when viewing conditions are poor and the dot joins with the rest of the letter?\n\n",

      "content": "You will hear many things on this topic if it gets going but let me start with the idea that a distinctive shape is helpful in reading the serif on some lc i & j forms may help enhance distinction. Another thing it may be doing is helping to ensure that even with rougher treatment in spacing that some needed negative space is maintained. The bar may also draw your eye to or in some way highlight the dot - the real marker of difference for i & j. But as far as I know there is no science on this. Just observation & supposition.\n\n"

It's cheating! Sans serif means \"no serifs\"! Of course there's nothing wrong with the practice---there are many typefaces that combine elements of serif and sans serif design to good effect. Interesting that I've never heard of a serif font where serif's were removed to enhance legibility.\n\n"

I can easily imagine a situation where somebody want to make a new sans & is interested in the techy feel of the mono and 'hey presto!' the semi serif is born. Also, the fact that these 'serifs' clearly help in a mono may have led the designer to extrapolate that they helped in their design too. And depending on the design - they might have.\n\nThe interesting question it seems to me is who started it? Was it by any chance... Erik S?\n\n\\*I don't know that I would call them that actually because they end up being part of the deep structure to my mind...\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks again Nick. It doesn't exactly look like the Ascent of Man(s), (place pun here) ;)  \nEben is on the correct path, I think: the monospace, brought the machine readable, which brought the techy feel. The \"el\" (and i, imho), notice, is two things, the rounded base on the left, and the serif on the right. Meta, e.g. barely shows the latter as opposed to OCR-B, but both have a rounded stroke ending on the left? So, some of this, I think also comes from what we're used to from..._italic_. I also note, that Orator, with it's monospaced some serif and practically no descent must'a been a reading chore I'm glad I never had.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

      "content": "_He may have kicked it off in Officina Sans_\n\nI most certainly did not, but I may have re-started the trend. ITC Officina is very much my version of Letter Gothic, which has the serif-i. The monospaced faces had to make the narrow letters wide and the wider ones narrow. So f, t and r had to be extended, i and j got a top serif and the l sometimes both top serif and bottom curl to the right. Same goes for cap I.\n\nWith proportional type you still get the benefit of more white space around narrow letters, which supposedly makes serif faces more pleasant (if not easier) to read. In other words: putting serifs on i, j, l or r makes a sans face less sans. The fact that this also avoids common confusion between l, i, I and 1 is really only important for forms, lists, directional signs and other information where one has to pick out single letters rather than read word shapes.\n\n"

It does not solve anything, but may cause uneven spacing. Why does an i j l or r need more leftside space than an h or m or n or u? If a sans is spaced too tight, all letters need more space. In my desire to know how it feels to design an l-with-a-tail, I tried and considered it a pain: Either you add only little space to the right -- then you need positive kerning to make sure it does not bump into following letters & punctuation marks. Or you avoid these collisions by increasing the l's right space, which results in holes in the text image, with some letter combinations -- then you need negative kerning to compensate for this. No extra trouble without the tail.  \n[Read as a remark about design technique, aesthetics or personal preferences being irrelevant here.]\n\n"
