  "content": "Hello all. First post here. Great place you guys have here.   \n   \nThis is a masthead Im working on for my new site. We are a design and application development company, just starting out. This is quite simple and I would like to keep it as simple as possible.   \n   \nCould anyone give me some suggestions on how to improve it. Colors, kerning, face, etc.   \n   \nThank you   \n   \n ![Masthead](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019123140im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35320.gif)\n\n",

I think that the word \"pulse\" requires a design that pulls in the viewer and makes them feel something within\n\n"

Its odd, I didnt even think of the tongue sticking out, that should have been the first thing to strike me. :p   \n   \nI will revise it and post some of the ideas.   \n   \nAny thoughts on the relation of the face (Neutraface) to the type of biz? I purchased this font because I thought it was really beautiful and clean, but I am definately not married to it for this logo.\n\n"

Im at a loss. Im trying to keep it a simple as possible, using only elements of type in the logo.   \n   \nDo you think it necessary to have a tagline for instance. If you saw IBM logo for the first time ever, would you know that that were about computers and related technology? This is what is stumping me on this one.   \n   \nOn one hand, of course, I would love to be able to get the idea across instantly. On the other, I think that the site and related print materials will do the job.   \n   \nOpinions much appreciated.   \n   \nHere are a few variations.   \n   \n ![Log2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019123140im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35587.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "I do not see why the logo needs in any way to \"enact\" a pulse. It says pulse already, to anyone who can read. Anyone who does not \"get\" pulse from the word \"pulse\" is missing something pretty basic. I suspect that most attempts to embody some sort of pulsing in the logo will either (a) be so obvious they look ghastly (the heart monitor) or (b) be so subtle they are irrelevant or (c) introduce unwarranted associations (as I think the \"musical\" logos do).   \n   \nNor can I see, with respect, why one has to get _design_ from the logo. The logo will not be used in a vacuum, and presumably it will be obvious from what is around it that design is what it is about.   \n   \nIt seems to me to be perfectly credible and indeed creditable that the logo, rather than saying _design_ tells people who already know that they are dealing with a design company _what sort_ of design they can expect: what its aesthetic tendency is. If the original logo does that, then I'd stick with the original.   \n   \nThe associations I'd get from the original are: spare, clean (super clean), perhaps a little bland, conservative (in a modernist sense), understated, heavily typographical. This is the sort of design I'd want for the annual report of a pharmaceutical company, not for a rock album cover.   \n   \nIf those are the right associations, then the logo is working. If they're not then (for me) it's not. For instance, if you wanted to project playfulness, or political commitment, or a sense of being at the bleeding edge, the logo does not do that for me.\n\n"
