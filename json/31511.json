Had a look at the charmap, to see how complete the typeface was, when something caught my eye\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wundes/sprouts/regular/charmap.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417164238/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/wundes/sprouts/regular/charmap.html \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wundes/sprouts/regular/charmap.html\")\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a abuse of copyright to have those digital images of \"The Scream\" in the font ?\n\n",

Since Edvard Munch died in 1944 the copyright will belong to Munch until year 2014. But the picture in Sprout isn't a copy of \"The Scream\", it's just a interpretation of the painting and then I think there are other laws that applies?\n\n"
