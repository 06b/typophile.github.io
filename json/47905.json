  "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm new to this site but I can already tell that this is a great site and is very helpful.\n\nI need help identifying this script. I'm not sure if its a font or custom made, however I love the signature quality it has to it. It flows very nice, has hand-drawn features like at the end of certain letters you can see a slight \"dab\" of ink as if the pen was held down a little more to create this. I love those kind of features. It also has a jumpy/loopy quality almost like a 50s kind of script.\n\nIf anyone can help me identify this or something that is very similar, that would be very appreciated.\n\nThank you very much\n\nJonE.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [500x500.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108222407/http:/typophile.com/files/500x500.jpg) | 57.36 KB |\n\n",
