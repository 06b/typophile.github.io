During the 1960s and 1970s -- the era of the Lettera 22 typewriter -- Stephenson Blake called the font \\_Doric 1 Italic\\_. Amsterdam called it \\_Old Gothic Bold\\_. Fonderie Typographique Française called it \\_Washington\\_. See font information in Jaspert's \\_The Encyclopedia of Typefaces [1970]\\_.  \nThe font was released in the U.S. by American Typefounders Company in 1898. Here is the release specimen published by \\_The Inland Printer\\_:  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724101934im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DoricItalicATF1898SM_3714.jpg)\n  \nMonotype says that Derek Italic is \"Thought to have developed from a display face first listed in 1890\" A very inadequate explanation of the fact that Derek Italic is in fact Doric Italic.  \nDon \n"
