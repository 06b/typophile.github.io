I know that letterror has 'Federal' -- BUT, it only works with Mac. Any other suggestions.   \n   \nP.S. This isn't some sort of False ID making scam ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141952im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) Hopefully my rep on this board preceeds me.   \n   \nThanks!!\n\n",

So, in principle, any ID's to try to help counterfeit anything should be avoided. I have refused to attempt to locate similar typefaces for type from what seemed to be official documents, whether it was stamps, serial numbers or the type itself.   \n   \nI don't know if this Board has a policy about that, but in my opinion it should.   \n   \nAs far as Federal only working with Mac, anyone with Fontographer, Fontlab's TransType, or the like, can convert from Mac to PC. That should be no problem. (If you have the font, I'll make the conversion for you.)\n\n"

It wouldn't be very wise to tell people what fonts could be used to forge a passport on a public forum.   \n   \nWe don't want to read in newspaper how someone did something stupid using a fake passport and how he/she found the correct typefaces on an Internet message board...   \n   \nEveryone here (Kyle included) are propably just interested in typography, but you never know...   \n   \nIf someone knows the passport-types, he/she might e-mail them to Kyle.\n\n"
