Influenced by Dwiggins, but fresh and different. I hope it will turn out to be a favorite for books.\n\n"

I've always admired Optima in signage, but in small sizes I thought it suffered by its color being too grey and dull. The new version solves the problems of weight and spacing, and adds a true italic. I don't know if this counts as new, or a revival. I am happy that Zapf had the opportunity, with his collaborator, to improve this classic design for the digital age.\n\n"

This is the only text sample I had on hand, a PDF that was prepared by Mamoun and Paul for the TDC annual early this year, and the font was not quite finished.   \n  \n_2) Does the font fully support the vertical floating aliph? \"'aLaahi\" (second word) certainly shows it, but some words (like \"rahmaan\" - 3rd word - and \"�aalika\" - penultimate word on 3rd line) are supposed to use that instead of the normal (slanted) floating aliph, because it's pronounced like a long-aliph but is not fully marked._   \n   \nI believe that's an encoding issue: the vertical alif mark used in _aLaahi_ is a different Unicode character from the fatha. I'm not sure whether Mamoun entered this text himself, or used an existing electronic text, in which case the encoding of marks is inherited.   \n  \n_3) I think this setting at least is underusing the kasheeda, which when applied well can greatly amplify the airy elegance of Arabic setting._   \n   \nYes, there is very little kasheeda use in this example. There would automatically be more if the text were justified, I believe, although I agree that justification is not the only reason to use kasheedas.   \n   \nNot obvious from the sample above, perhaps, are two of my favourite features of the font: contextual differentiation of similar letters by modifying tooth length, and the cursive connection feature that gradually raises preceding letters off the baseline:   \n ![Arabic Typesetting contextual and cursive](http://web.archive.org/web/20070402033944im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22401.gif)\n\n"
