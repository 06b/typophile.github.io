      "content": "My first graphic on this theme using the peace font Wahei created by Luc Devroye.\n\nColours represent individual nations/peoples, each nation/peoples peace sign is slightly different variation. The colours also rep other stuffs too, such as the environment, candy life savers... Although the grouping of peace signs are bunched tight together showing unity, each peace sign sould seem ’balanced’ on top of one another, idea being a peaceful diverse balance.\n\nStencil variation next.\n\nThanks again Luc for the font!!\n\n"
