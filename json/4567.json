Do you know any publication or website where I could find a specimen of this typeface?   \n  \nIn broader terms, talking about the context in which it appeared, Robert Bringhurst in \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" relates it to the Realist movement in art. Do you know of any other source in which this is further discussed?   \n   \nThanks a lot\n\n",

      "content": "\\>the Caslon sans of the 1820s, so praised for its early appearance, has no real relevance.   \n   \nHuh? The guy invents a major genre and it's irrelevant?! The sans is present in the specimen books of UK typefounders (I'm not familiar with other countries, but I would imagine the same situation) from the 1830s, and in steady use, especially advertising, subsequently.   \n   \nCaslon's sans had a very geometric quality -- circular Os and straight-legged R etc. Figgins sans's of the 1830s show an indecision between geometric and grotesque qualities, with versions at different sizes leaning one way or the other.   \n   \nThose earliest sans were Bold and Caps only, and appear to have been used mainly for contrast, in text work. The most popular early sans was probably the Bold Condensed style, used in a range of sizes, particularly in commercial jobbing. Regular weight sans faces were used in the 1840s.   \n   \nI suspect that the introduction of lower case to the sans genre pushed it in a grotesque direction, as the world was not ready for a geometric lower case at that time (the 3rd quarter of the 19thC), when the radical tone of the early century had become more conservative.   \n   \nAG is well-known for the logic of its systematic family, and it is tempting to equate this modernist idea with the sans genre -- however, almost no-one used sans faces for text in 1900. In fact it was the massively popular Cheltenham that lead the way in being a face with a large family that you could set an entire job in: heads, decks, subheads, and text.\n\n"

      "content": "In my opinion, we could talk about two different approaches to the grotesque, one developed mainly in the UK and USA, and the other in Germany, that follow different lines.   \n   \nAs I see it, the first develops in the UK from the Caslon breakthrough, and represents the modulated, less geometrical approach, that has in Franklin Gothic its paradigm. The tipology of this line remains fixed through time. Thus Trade Gothic (1948) and News Gothic (1908) belong to the same formal category.   \n   \nThe German grotesques of the XIX century, like Akzidenz Grotesk, tend to geometry and monoline anatomy, and a more systematic development of the range of weights. I think this ascetic approach fitted more the rationalist modern spirit of the XX century typographic avant-gardes. Thus, this grotesque tipology evolved in time into neogrotesque (Helvetica, 1957), by absorbing the influences of the technical and aesthetical proposals of those avant-gardes.   \n   \nOf course, this comparison has nothing to do with a value judgement, in terms of one being \"better\" than the other in any way.\n\n"

It is thought by some historians to be a dead link. There are other earlier examples but they were seemingly only found in stone cutting.   \n   \nMore likely there was some form of interplay of influence between styles offered from different countries.   \n   \nFor instance. The Americans who developed decorative wood type based it on British metal type imports which were in turn derived from French decorated typefaces and then Dutch, at about the turn of the century and very early 1900s. The popularity of American wood type in turn resulted in metal type foundries churning out a lot of similar decorated styles.   \n   \nSometimes the string of influence is just not a straight line.   \n   \nGerald\n\n"
