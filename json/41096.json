  "content": "dear community,\n\nas the titel suggests i am looking for suggestions concerning a sansserif typeface that..\n\na) features an international character set (specifically latin, greek and cyrillic)\n\nb) provides itself in various weights (light, regular, medium, bold + italics)\n\nc) has a modern/grotesque appeal to it but is slightly newer/fresher/more contemporary (sorry, i know it depends on ones perspective) then 'classics' like helvetica, trade, et cetera..\n\ncurrently i am looking at typefaces like 'akkurat' by lineto or 'national' by klimtype which i personally really like -\n\nthe typeface is supposed to be used as a corporate typeface that will be used within a complete corporate design system.\n\nany recommandations/suggestions are highly welcome/appreciated!\n\nthanks a lot + kind regards,\n\nsteffen\n\n",

Kievit i have to look into..\n\nas well as Anselm + Bliss Pro are interesting -\n\nthe fontfeed link is absolutely great though, so thanks stephen!\n\nThe possibility of National in greek + cyrillic would be extraordinary, but it would probably take up too much time to be designed.. But maybe, who knows..\n\nI will have a look at the fonts at ourtype (just came to mind) + get back..\n\nI still like National the most though..\n\nBest + thanks to you both,\n\nso far,\n\nsteffen\n\n"

I think they tend to buy Akkurat from Lineto. I will send a mail to Kris (?) from Klimtype anyway since i am personally very interested in National which i really like -\n\nWhat is it about the greek and cyrillic in Privia that appears problematic to you, paul - or mr.
