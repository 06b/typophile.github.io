I second the restaurants – [lettershapes everywhere](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820165924/http:/homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo03/DSCF0021_1.JPG), some [beautiful calligraphy](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820165924/http:/homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo06/P1010548.JPG) (and/or [funky stuff](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820165924/http:/homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo06/P1010538.JPG)). But even just [stenciled signs](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820165924/http:/homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo06/P1010515.JPG), [traffic directions painted on streets](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820165924/http:/homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo06/P1010517.JPG), or LED signs are just… amazing. I found it especially funky how the different alphabets/scripts are combined and interchanged (like [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820165924/http:/homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo07/P1010677.JPG)).\n\nBTW if you're in/near Tokyo, and interested in graffiti: while Tokyo doesn't seem to have any really, [Yokohama does](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820165924/http:/homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo07/P1010752.JPG).\n\n"
