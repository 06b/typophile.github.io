      "content": "Hi Daniel.   \n   \nYes and no I should think. That n is craziness :-) Other than that the most \\*original\\* aspect in my opinion is the double serif (on an angle no less) instead of the standard triangular serif. The only thing I can think of off hand is the recent Romain du Roi thread in general discussions, though yours has some assymetrical palatino happening.   \n   \nProps for the sketches. If there truely is no Romain du Roi in digital format, maybe go that direction.   \n   \nGood luck!   \nRandy\n\n"

See Jenson Old Style, URW Cloister and ITC Italia. The RdR head serifs are flat and severe. And to me this doesn't look very RdR at all - there's all kinds of chirographic stuff happening - the RdR is typographique par excellence.   \n   \nBTW, I think that \"n\" is an \"ri\".   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Especially if you're planning a full face including SC, oldstyle figures, alternates, and a whole set of ligatures, this could end up being a distinctive and stunning font.   \n   \nMaybe alter the right side of the serif on m and n\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, guys. I'm almost done with a digitized lowercase that might give a better impression of where I'm going with this. The historical references are really, really helpful.   \n   \nRandy, that was actually just playing around with the possibility of an \"r i\" ligature, but it looks too much like an n. That might be an interesting alternate for the n, come to think of it. And yes, the dots are too high. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120335im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nChase, I have a feeling that I'm going to have to break a lot of my own rules to make this work. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120335im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) Let me show you the ditital version, and you can tell me if it's still too crowded.\n\n"

      "content": "I really like this, Daniel. I like the double serif on the m, n, and u as well, but maybe you could \"scoop\" away some of the vertical stroke at the top right beneath the serif--just a little. The bowl of the b, d, p, and q look a little compressed--or maybe the a looks a little too wide? If experience serves me, Randy Jones may suggest that the r looks like a modified n. You may try lowering the joint where the arm meets the stem. The spine of the s could use a little thickening, too. I love the t.   \n   \nI'm learning myself, so take this for what it's worth. My terminology may be a little off, too. Sorry.   \n   \nGood luck,   \nAddison\n\n"

Asymmetrical full serifs that are prominent but not overpowering and modulated stroke.   \n   \nI'd add a touch of curve to the lower side of the ear on the lc G or make it a miniature version of the brushstroke terminal on the J.   \n   \nGreat work.\n\n"
