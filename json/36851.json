The straight to curve transitions need to be smoothed out a little bit better. The k need to be reworked- made narrower. I think maybe the stroke weight is a little too heavy?\n\nI love the dots on the i’s- they looks like lemons.\n\nHoped I helped you.\n\nMike Diaz\n\n"

Looking real close the top part of the curve maybe a bit jagged. I am happy with the general curve angle though. What do you think? They are supposed to mirror the dots on the ’i’s’\n\nI was actually happy with the ’w’ - should I compare it to other typefaces to refine the proportion? I would have to reduce the angle of the arms to make it narrower as it is supposed to be geometric in proportion.\n\nThe more I look at the ’k’ the more I think it could be improved. To maintain it’s geometric appearance again I would have to reduce the 45 degree angle on the arms. What do you make of the descender on the ’k’? I feel it sits maybe a little uncomfortably but not due to it’s proximity to the following ’i’.\n\nThank you all for your invaluable feedback. Please keep it coming.\n\nJay\n\n"

      "content": "Hi again :\n\nI’m not sure what you call it but when certain curves are not antialiased or hinted they look really rough.  \nI think but I’m not sure- the k would look better if the angle of the right part of the k was a little more ’open’. This would also mean that the w have to be more compact as well. This is a good thing because it will give the descender on the k more room with the i.\n\nBut there is something else that concerns me... The logo is geometric and extended and so is the “truly natural body care”. I think you should have the logo extended and text normal or condensed. The logo should be funky and the text a neutral sans. I think it would aid in better presentation of what the product does. Right now you might have two things competing with each other.\n\nWill this be for a bottle, box, or the whole entire campaign?\n\nAll my best,\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"

      "content": "OK, here are some revisions I have made. This logotype would be for an entire campaign to include a bottle, box, print collateral etc.\n\nI have thinned the strokes and made it a little more condensed by reducing the ’k’ and ’w’.  \nThe ’g’ has been updated to simple include a circular descender.\n\nI am in two minds about the use of Tarzana for the ’truly natural bodycare’ tagline. I understand Mike’s comments about competition between the logotype and the tag. I have tried setting it in Helvetica and of course, it looks so neutral that it could not be obtrusive. For the purpose of this critique I have left it set in Tarzana as I feel I would prefer to use something that represented the overall identity and message more.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nThanks,  \nJay\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080414234124im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/kiwi%20glow%20type5_6337.jpg)\n\n"

In a wordmark, either all the letters need to be equal in character or there should be one letter that’s carrying the quirks, with the others supporting it. You’ve got the ’g’ and the ’w’, and in some sense the ’k’ all fighting with each other for attention, while the ’i’ and ’o’ are bit players.\n\nLook at the whole wordmark small as well. The connection between the top and bottom of the ’g’ is almost insignificant and may disappear. The ’g’ form has potential, but needs some work. Try making the bottom smaller than the top.\n\n"
