  "content": "howdy from austin, tx... I'm having some trouble locating a typeface for a project.\n\ni'm usually very much a traditionalist when it comes to type selection, this project is requiring that i cast a wider net (hopefully someone here would be kind enough to offer their expertise).\n\nthe feeling the face needs to communicate is one of strength and speed. the closest thing i could find was the Propel drink logo (see here) [http://www.dontgetlost.ca/raid/Propel%20logo.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20130813202704/http:/www.dontgetlost.ca/raid/Propel%20logo.JPG \"http://www.dontgetlost.ca/raid/Propel%20logo.JPG\")\n\nits almost something like a sports team would have, i like the way the propel logotype utilizes subtle motion indicators without looking garish.\n\ni would be most appreciative of any help that could be offered. thank you.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Propel logo.JPG\\_.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130813202704/http:/typophile.com/files/Propel%20logo.JPG__0.jpg) | 34.16 KB |\n\n",
