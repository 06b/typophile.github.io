Eagle would probably be a good choice for this industry.   \n   \nDuring my initial consultation with the client, we determined that the most important elements to the customer relationship are trust and reliability. Recognizing the need for boldness (\"aggressive and macho\") within industry applications and considering the look of reliability, I created the bold DETEX type. Also recognizing that most pest control is sold door-to-door during the day, I knew that the logo needed to be soft enough for a predominantly female market, hense, the soft \"E's\" and the gray (vs. Unocal blue) and orange (vs. the industry standard red) combination. I felt that this would help create warmth, rather than aggressive heat, and contribute to the trust factor.   \n   \nI'm thinking that the space between the name and title on the bizcard needs to be decreased\n\n"

I also don't like the middle bars being different lengths than the outer bars.   \n   \nThe \"E\" connecting only at the bottom of the \"X\" seems odd because the top has the same relationship as the bottom, and they don't connect.
