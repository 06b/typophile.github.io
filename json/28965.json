I went through all of my notes and cannot find any from my research on Perpetua. (This doesn't surprise me as I did lose over 3 boxes worth of my life when I shipped it back to me.) From what I recall of the article did have samples of the roman and the sloped roman, respectively Perpetua and Felicity. Any assistance for this beggar will be very much appreciated.\n\n",

I am still going to copie the rest, but the one they had in my clossest library was damaged. Somewhere iin the comming two weeks I am going to visit another library and copie the rest.\n\n"
