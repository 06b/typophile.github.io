  "content": "Where, when, and how was it decided that a calendar grid should always have exactly five rows, even where logic would seem to dictate six rows?\n\nWhy is this convention used even on wall calendars which clearly have space for a sixth row, even if this would mean decreasing space used for a \"notes\" section or pithy quotes or some such? Note that only a partial sixth row is ever needed.\n\nEven if for some reason it is forbidden to use a sixth row, why use \"23/30\" and/or \"24/31\", thus cramming five characters into a single cell? Why not instead use \"1/8\" and/or \"2/9\"?\n\n",

      "content": "I assume you're talking about printed calendars, as I think computer calendars generally have 6 rows when appropriate. At least the one I use (iCal) does.\n\nI've designed a few printed calendars and have always used 5 rows max because if you had 6 rows the top and bottom rows would be mostly blank, plus all the rows become smaller in height, leaving less room for people to write notes.\n\nI've never had a client complain about doubling some dates, but they'll complain if the cells are too small.\n\nNot sure why the tradition is to double up on the last row (such as \"24/31\"), but I assume it's because doubling would often occur just on a Sunday when people probably have fewer appointments to jot down, plus (and maybe this is the main reason) it's less obvious than doubling on the top row.\n\n"

      "content": "I think, Dumpling, you've answered your own question. Many, many years ago I was required each year to hand-set in 6-line wood letter the kind of wall calendars I'm sure you are referring to. We produced them for a number of local companies who handed them out to their customers. They were created on a seven by five grid and printed on a Heidelberg 10x15 platen press. A seven by six grid would, as you state, mean that the sixth row would be only partially used.\n\nAlthough these calendars didn't have note-making space, our customers liked them for the large numerals; six rows would have meant smaller numerals.\n\nAs to why the doubling is on the last week rather than the first, JamesM's explanation is a good as any. Also, maybe, the 1/8 solution you suggest is similar to 18 whereas a 23/30 (as would occur this September) is much more obvious as two dates.\n\nIt is, as you say yourself, the convention. It's what we're used to and so needs a good reason to change. I recognise that you ask where did it come from and why and I suspect it was simply a straightforward compromise which is now the custom and practice through continued use.\n\n"
