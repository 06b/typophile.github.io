      "content": "In 1935 a New York hospital would have most probably have used typewriters from US companies such as Underwood, Remington, Smith Premier etc.  \nAt the scale of your image I can't tell you the make or model used.\n\nDetails of typefaces used by these and other companies changed over the years. Some key letters to check are \\_4\\_, whether open or closed -- your sample is closed and \\_3\\_ -- whether round top or flat top -- your sample is flat top. Also whether the \\_g\\_ is one story, i.e. with a tail like a hook or two story, i.e. with a closed bowl at the bottom, like a pair of glasses -- your sample is two story. There are other features of your sample that you could seek to duplicate, like the ball at the end of the tail at the top of \\_6\\_, but most people would not notice this.\n\nIf you want to duplicate the feel of a typewriter you need a monospaced font. If the font does not say then check the sample text \\_NMW\\_ or \\_nmw\\_. The \\_M\\_ and \\_W\\_ should look squeezed so that the type key width is the same as \\_N\\_. All keys are the same width, so in a monospace typewriter font the \\_I\\_ and \\_i\\_ usually have very wide serifs to fill the space.\n\nSome monospace fonts that would work as substitutes:  \nLTC Remington Typewriter, [no obvious discrepancies, a fairly high probability that this was the make used, & very cleanly engineered font] [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-remington-typewriter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-remington-typewriter/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-remington-typewriter/\") Includes an italic designed by Frederic Goudy in 1927.  \nRemington Elite [wrong \\_3\\_, but a fairly high probability that this was the make used, & very cleanly engineered font]  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/remington-elite-typewriter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/remington-elite-typewriter/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/remington-elite-typewriter/\")  \nUnderwood Typewriter [no obvious discrepancies, a fairly high probability that this was the make used, & very cleanly engineered font]  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/underwood-typewriter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/underwood-typewriter/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/underwood-typewriter/\") also [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/underwood-typewriter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/underwood-typewriter/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/underwood-typewriter/\")  \nSmith Premier NF [no obvious discrepancies & very cleanly engineered font]  \nIntellecta Typewriter [no obvious discrepancies]  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/intellecta-typewriter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/intellecta-typewriter/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/intellecta-typewriter/\")  \nBulletin Typewriter [no obvious discrepancies]  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/bulletin-typewriter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/bulletin-typewriter/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/bulletin-typewriter/\")\n\nIf you do not need a monospace font a good generic substitute is ITC American Typewriter [https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-american-typewriter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111943/https:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-american-typewriter/ \"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-american-typewriter/\")\n\nI did not include grunge or distressed faces. IMHO they are a waste of time for recreating documents.\n\nUpdate:  \nDeleted possibly controversial comment.\n\nUpdate:  \nI don't know if these otf fonts can be used on a Mac. If not there is always Courier,despite the one story \\_g\\_.  \nDon\n\n"

Though the shooter was caught, his case was inexplicably dismissed, leaving the question of motive forever unanswered.  \n---end game quote---  \nsource [http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/214593](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111943/http:/www.brownpapertickets.com/event/214593 \"http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/214593\")\n\nPerhaps this specimen is a prop?\n\nDon\n\n"
