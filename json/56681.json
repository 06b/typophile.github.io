Thus, I finally decided that a simple vector file would be a better alternative, with a basic modular design, a handful of letter alternatives, ligatures and decorative elements, providing the user with the freedom to construct their own combinations. here are the first sketches of this Idea:\n\nChurch Slavonic:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150401064707im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vyaz5_4913.gif)\n\nLonger passage without archaic letters:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150401064707im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vyaz4_5848.gif)\n\nDifferent ligature options:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150401064707im_/http:/typophile.com/files/liga_5815.png)\n\nThis is what I am trying to base it on:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150401064707im_/http:/typophile.com/files/historicvyaz_6075.gif)\n\n",
