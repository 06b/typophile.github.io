I don't know if the \"Sh\" has to be connected to the \"oo\", or even if the \"oo\" needs to be connected to the swoosh.\n\nI'd say simplify it. Pick one element that you think works best, and focus on that, whether it's the ball with the swoosh, or the goal, or something else.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

They are including stuffed soccer balls with packets. I am to design the information packets.\n\nTime to tinker some more.\n\nThanks for the feedback, gents.\n\n"
