I think those look like one of Hans Eduard Meier’s calligraphic fonts, such as [Barbedor](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007003424/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/barbedor/) or [Syndor](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007003424/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/syndor/). I’m having trouble seeing your image details well enough, but I lean towards Barbedor.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
