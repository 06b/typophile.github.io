It made 6,000 pieces of type per hour, a rate that so threatened the employment of many handcasters that a group of them plotted to destroy the machine. The device was used by other typefounders, notably [Miller & Richard](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204222811/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Miller%20%2526%20Richard).\n\nThe foundry was acquired by [ATF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204222811/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ATF) in 1901.\n\n",
