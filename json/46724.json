  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI am having an issue with TTF fonts in PCs being displayed too small in MS Word and Bistream’s font manager . (see attach)\n\nIn the beginning I thought I’ve made a mistake in the TrueType Metrics, but after reading in the FL Forum “Tips and Tricks: Setting Font Family Metrics in FontLab” carefully I realized this was not the case.\n\nThe fonts has 1000 units UPM and only if I set it with 2048 they are displayed correctly.\n\nI thought 2048 units were not mandatory for TTF fonts but apparently this is the case here.\n\nOr am I doing something else wrong?\n\nHave anyone had the same problem with TTF set with 1000 units? And which was the solution?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bellucci\\_wordtest\\_20.06 copy.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905084105/http:/typophile.com/files/bellucci_wordtest_20.06%20copy.jpg) | 174.02 KB |\n\n [‹ ascenders cut off in MS Word](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905084105/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45635 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [??match masters?? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905084105/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46825 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Now I think the changes were due to cached data.\n\nI still have the same problem using 1000 units or 2048. I have no clue how can I fix it.\n\nDoes anybody know what Font info values Microsoft Word takes in consideration to render the Fonts Menu?\n\nMany thanks.\n\n"
