Here's a direct link to [Boxer Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516140601/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=JBT0000010), but you might want to look at [Fenway Park](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516140601/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=JBT0000019) as well. It doesn't have as harsh of a baseline join as Boxer Script does.\n\n"
