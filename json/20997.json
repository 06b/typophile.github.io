The list being in German is not much of a factor understanding Company & font names, but the lists are rather narrow in their scope, and heavily weighted towards German firms. Broadening it to include a wider selection would be more useful. If there was a way we could contribute to it, we might share the resource somehow with them, which seems like a nice idea for two similar sites.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
