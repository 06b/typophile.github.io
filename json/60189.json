  "content": "I'm creating a handwritten font right now. Had a question if anyone can help?\n\nI'm currently using Fontographer to create.\n\nCan I make the font so that when two Zs (e.g. ZZ) are typed together they will produce a different looking combination effect versus if I use a Z in another way (e.g. Za or ZA)? Basically, ZZ is stylized a different way from a regular Z.\n\nI think this is called a ligature, but I'm new to font creation and new to Fontographer. I only found one mention of ligatures in the Fontographer manual.\n\nThanks in advance for the instruction.\n\n",

      "content": "Yes, it's called ligatures. You can set a character substitution using OpenType feature tag which goes like this:\n\n# Ligature formation  \nfeature liga {  \n substitute f i by f\\_i;  \n substitute f l by f\\_l;  \n} liga;\n\nYou can find more sample of this at:  \n [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic\\_feature\\_file\\_syntax.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020185322/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html \"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic\\_feature\\_file\\_syntax.html\")\n\nUnfortunately, you can't write those feature tags in Fontographer. Fortunately, you can use a tool called VOLT which is freely downloadable from:  \n [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020185322/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx\")\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
