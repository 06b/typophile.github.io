  "content": "Hi Guys,   \n   \nThanks in advance for any help/advice given.   \n   \nI am designing a Photo Album for the Past President of CPA Australia (the largest business organisation in the southern hemisphere with well over 100,000 members). It is to commemorate his year as president and include photos of his journeys and attendances at conferences in Australia and Asia.   \n   \nHe loves sailing and my concept is to use Maps of Australia and Asia to made to look a little antique.   \n   \nAny idea of fonts that might suit this purpose (or any ideas for where I might find examples of cool old maps?)   \n   \nThanks again!\n\n",

A \"one off \" on a Vandercook can give you superior results without inhaling reams of paper.   \n   \nI recommend fine hand made paper, or a pedigree watercolor stock. Good laundry is always important. Something acid free. Remember�no acid. Remember what happens to photographs.   \n   \nHave it set by hand, or set on by Monotype.   \n   \nSince you are in Melbourne talk to these fine folk.   \n   \n [http://home.vicnet.net.au/~typo/collect/typemach/monocomp.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124024/http:/home.vicnet.net.au/~typo/collect/typemach/monocomp.htm)   \n   \nPick a typeface, probably Caslon Oldstyle, if they have the matrices.   \n   \n [http://lanstontype.com/CaslonFountEight.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124024/http:/lanstontype.com/CaslonFountEight.html)   \n   \nTalk to bookbinder, see what he can do with tradtional sailmaker's cloth, and twine. Avoid gold stamping.   \n   \nQuarter bound with natural leather, sailmakers cloth. If your binder has a problem with it, talk to your sailmaker.   \n   \nUse the right materials, keep it understated, don't take it too far, don't get corny.   \n   \nI am a bit of an \"old gaffer\" myself.
