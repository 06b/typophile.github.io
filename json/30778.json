I'm sure if you posted this same request there, you'd get a few responses. There's also a LETPRESS group over at yahoo groups and you could ask there as well. Can't wait for the movie! --jimmy\n\n"

But this is not cheap.  \nFor the new types you have to calculate from 48 p  \n1 kg - approx. 75 Euro\n\nAnd it can be shipped in anglo-american heigt.\n\nThe used ones are much more cheaper, but with a german height.\n\nRegards,  \nGeorg\n\n"
