I've tried the color sites, but don't really get much. Any library suggestions - old issues of something that might be worth a look?  \nThanks\n\n",

Movies credited Technicolor consultants, who were aware of the shifts in colour that occurred because the film material was far from true…\n\nOn topic: The feel of an era is just that: a feeling. As far as all of the elements in your designs evoke that feel an out-of-place colour won’t shatter the illusion, but probably enhance it.\n\n. . . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

I need to really get into that sight and learn how to ask it. In reply to oprion, I was born during WWII [and Martin thinks he is a dinosaur!] and the first images that impressed me were the publications printed on a stock that muted the colors. I think it is that look I am after. I am especially thinking of the British publications from that era, although all the classic magazines from that period, Colliers, for example had the same look. I suspect it was because of the high pulp content of the paper. And I agree with Bert. If I can set the mood with the subject one discordant color shouldn't spoil and might enhance something.And thank you Don, for suggesting Leslie Carbaga's reference.  \nmgk\n\n"
