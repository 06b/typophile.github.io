So that's why fl, ffl, fi, etc., get ligatured -- it's across minor areas of horizontal space where they're almost already touching anyway? q and u, to be properly ligaturized, would just maybe join the q's top right serif and the u's top left. Right?\n\nExceptions: archaisms like AE (Æ)and OE (Œ), where the two letters are fused along long stretches of vertical stroke. I notice, though, that they're not diphthongs-- you don't say \"Ay-Ee-sopp,\" but \"Ay-sop.\" Not \"Oh-ee-di-puss\" but \"Eh-di-puss.\" That's probably relevant.\n\nSeems like the \"why not\" answer has formal/perceptual, historical, and phonological roots.

Kerned pairs involve various overshoots and undershoots, like the QU above.\n\nKerning is all about bringing two letters just close enough that the positive and negative space across the pair looks balanced. The more kerned pairs (where appropriate), the more balanced a font will look along the line.(Although... Adobe can do its own metrics (\"optical\"), but I have yet to test a kerned-pair-less font with it...)\n\nNotice that your Q and U would look odd if the Q was spaced further out to the left. There'd be this big white space between the two. Then again, the tight kerning only makes sense because of the Q's tail and the U being an oddball small size (small cap, lowercase, or just it's own thing).\n\nSo what you have above is a kerned pair that is more than the sum of its parts. But not a ligature! Still... if you joined the right end of the Q's tail to the end of the right side stroke of the U, then you'd have a ligature that doesn't fuse the letters in a bad way.\n\nBy the way, check out newspaper headlines-- they're often so tightly tracked that you get damn near ligatures across letters, but not intentionally.\n\n"

Hrant and others seem to be exploiting. I mean, of course negative space (if \"white\" under normal circumstances) is important. But let's not play silly semantic games for a moment: if the term \"ligature\" is gonna have any usefulness, it needs to refer to something specific. And I'm suggesting that it refers _not_ to the pair of letters that are designed in one piece, and/or that may have been joined as one piece in metal, and/or that come as one glyph in modern fonts, but either (a) to the pair when joined by a specific _chunk of stuff_ (when the letters are black, the stuff is black), or (b) the to chunk of stuff itself.\n\nAnyway, that's my own sense of the term _ligature_. Otherwise, you just have pairs (or larger sets) of glyphs that happen to be real close together and happen to sometimes appear as a unit in various systems.\n\n"
