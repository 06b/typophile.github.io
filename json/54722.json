  "content": "Hi gang,\n\nA colleague of mine needs help identifying the face used in the words \"VITAL SPEECHES,\" and I'm drawing a blank. It's not:\n\n- Caslon Openface  \n- any of the Handtooled families from ITC (Century, Garamond, Cheltenham)  \n- Acanthus Open  \n- Narcissus  \n- Academy Engraved  \n- Monotype Old Face\n\nThe A is one of the distinctive characters.\n\n(And yes, I know that the TA pair needs to be kerned, and that \"of the day\" is Trajan.)\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124044805im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vital_speeches_4976.jpg)\n\n",
