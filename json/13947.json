InDesign plays particularly well with other applications from Adobe such as [Photoshop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010224702/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adobe%20Photoshop) and [Illustrator](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010224702/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adobe%20Illustrator), and it is particularly good at creating [PDFs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010224702/http:/typophile.com/wiki/PDF). It also features support for [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010224702/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) fonts.\n\nMore about Adobe InDesign [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010224702/http:/www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html).\n\n",
