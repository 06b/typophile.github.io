  "content": "Hi there -\n\nI am going to make a booklet to be inserted in a cd cover. Quite a lot of text is needed, so I will have to use a size around 7 ... 7,5 ... 8 ... 8,5 pt.\n\nI have not yet considered any fonts. It could be a sans or a serifed - it only has to be highly legible in very small sizes.\n\nThe booklet is to be laserprinted in 144dpi (as is the whole cd cover, which I make as a gift for a friend).\n\nCould be interesting to hear your views. Sorry if this has been beaten to the bone regularly – I have been away from Typophile for a couple of years.\n\n---\n\nsoren\\_olsen\n\n",

The booklet that will be inserted in the cover will be around 8 pages of nothing but text, probably two columns. This booklet I will do in InDesign.\n\nThe reason I brought on the subject of resolution is that the project will not be produced in offset - but will be made using a color printer, KonicaMinolta Bizhub (possibly bizhub 350 or similar). I now realize that 144 lpi may be the wrong thing to say (at the moment I wrote the post I remembered that figure, because I have used it for photos at one point) the res may be quite higher when dealing with vector graphics and type ... frankly, I don't know very much about it :-/\n\nBTW ... what's your opinion on Charter as regards to legibility in small sizes (given that you don't hate the sight of that typeface)?\n\n--  \nsoren\\_olsen\n\n"
