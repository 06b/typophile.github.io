I limited the angles to one oblique of a bout 40 degrees and 90 degrees from it or the baseline. I may complete the typeface and see if there is a market for a modern blackletter perhaps with the rock band folks or some such thing.\n\nThe border is supposed to look like that tire chain stuff that is seen around license plates on cars.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
