  "content": "Apologies if this has been asked before, but I've searched and not been able to come up with any conclusive answers. I'm in my last year of my Graphic Design course at Staffordshire University. I've been studying the originality of Garamond to produce a set of designs which highlight how Garamonds originality has been lost throughout it's many versions.\n\nBasically without me going into great depth and detail. I was wondering if anybody knew which are the most prominent versions of Garamond and the characteristics which define them from the original 16th century cut, for example x-height. I'm going to end my design with ITC Garamond as I believe this is the furthest deviation from the original.\n\nThe other problem I'm having is obtaining the original version of Garamond. I've studied the Egenolff-Berner foundry specimen of Garamond from 1592. But ideally I would need a digitised version of the original. Does such a thing exist? Has anybody made an accurate digital version of the original?\n\nI'm sorry to ask so many questions, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Is it the punches? The specimen? You've probably read Smeijers <cite>Counerpunch</cite>. Did whoever made the punches test them by lightly inking them & pressing them into paper? What was he looking at as he adjusted the punches -- or did he bother?\n\nInk & paper & printing were different then, too, so whatever was looked at was based on that technology. If you are just after a pure mechanical size, I suppose the punches themselves would give the dimensions of \"the type.\" There would always be small variations in the printed type. But those dimensions aren't particularly interesting, either, nor would they show variations with current digital Garamonds, where (we hope) the digital punchcutter also look at the results of a printed specimen -- & then decide whether to go with a version that worked best with (1) a laser printer, or (2) high resolution offset, the latter coming form either (1) repro-negative-plate, or (2) direct-to-plate.\n\nYou get different answers depending on how you first answer these questions.\n\n"

From the links provided I have been able to identify some of the more prominent Garamonds and their characteristics.\n\nHowever I'm most interested in 1592 Garamond, if it as you say a direct tracing from the forms of the \"original\", or the Berner. I have tried searching for this version but I'm unable to find any reference to it, or any foundry that I can purchase from. Without being to much of a pain could somebody point me in the right direction?\n\n"

In fact, without the original drawings or matrices, any \"Garamond\" is going to be subject to the type designer's whims and interpretations of the printed type specimens.\n\nThat being said, Slimbach's Garamond Premier Pro is considered to be the \\*most accurate\\* rendition by most Typophilers, and will probably be as close to \"original\" as anyone can get short of resurrecting Garamond himself.\n\n"

(I'll go bang my head against the wall by way of apology.)\n\nIf you look at p. 74 of Bringhurst you can see what Ross Mills has taken his digitalization from — and his letterforms are very accurate renditions of these shapes. I do agree with DanGayle that despite this the 1530 Garamond of Mills does not look, on the page, that much like a page of Garamond. The forms are too anaemic.\n\n"
