  "content": "I need to find some good, versatile fonts that are \"clean & a bit quirky\" without being silly or too far in any one direction... So far I think Archer & Museo \\*(not Museo Sans) fit the bill...\n\nAnyone have other suggestions that have similar qualities to Museo or Archer?\n\nAlso; what's up with Museo not having italics? I could really use them... Are they coming? Is there another font that could masquerade as Museo italics? (thought about vista sans italics for a second...)\n\n",
