At the scale it is showing on my screen I would say your “as” is okay but the apostrophe should move slightly to the right. Given the tightness of Alterations, the a’s does leap out but you shouldn’t hide the meaning just because it looks ugly.  \nTim\n\n"

But even so one can only do an optimum spacing for a perceived use, so a display face might be tighter than a text face, but if you use a text face at a large size you should bear that in mind.  \nTim\n\n"
