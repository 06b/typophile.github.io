Juliet feels that this is because his approach was that of an engineer which seems reasonable to me.\n\n<cite>Clearface</cite>\n\nThanks Paul. I will have to have a look at that.

She coined the term I think to illustrate a contrast she saw in his work vs ’consistent’ pen derived forms. The reason I think this is interesting is that there are advantages and to be had with either approach. So recognizing the power to be derived from a more purely Typographic set of solutions is interesting both because they work, and because they have been distinctively ( typographically/optically ) derived.\n\nAnd in terms of the ’what’, eg the evidence for this idea - that’s what I want to assemble.\n\nPaul Romaine, Thanks!\n\nKent, I have contact info for Paul.

American metal typefaces freely adopt design details from the historical legacy without regard to maintaining the underlying logic of a particular tool or “stroke”.

For instance, some are more comfortable doing revivals than original work, and some are more adept at producing subtle shapes than novel forms. But there is plenty of room for eclecticism at both ends of the revival-experimental spectrum.\n\nEdit: this post doesn’t address Juliet’s specific use of the term “Yankee Eclecticism”, due to a crossed post.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the link, which I just greatly enjoyed viewing.\n\nJuliet, I really appreciate your insights, which are revealing and on target.\n\nI would somewhat take issue, though, with the idea that Benton violated the pen more than Europeans. When I look at your slide of older sans faces that Benton was reacting to, I don’t see them as particularly showing the pen hand more than Benton. I haven’t made a study of it, but my impression is that Victorian type was already willing to go to all kinds of shapes that had to do more with decorative effect, rather than the broad pen, or even the pointed pen.\n\nIt is true, as you point out, that Benton had the American willingness to mix styles without regard to historical period—but that is a different matter than the influence of the pen in hand. Also I would note that Caslon and I believe Dutch before him already had old style strokes on most of the round letters, but not on the O,o, which had vertical stress.\n\nFinally, while it is true that Benton hasn’t had the press of other designers, I think the appreciation of his types both by connoisseurs and the general public has been always strong. Today on typophile everyone writes of the ATF cataloges with admiration and awe. And today the cataloges of Font Bureau and of Hoefler & Frere-Jones show a huge influence of Benton.\n\nI’m trying to remember where I read it, but I think someone said that MF Benton was the first type designer in the modern sense. Because of the pantographic punch cutter that his father invented, he was able to draw type, and mechanize production. So he could do a huge variety of designs, as you point out.\n\nAs you also point out, he wasn’t the greatest in producing elegant designs. But he was the greatest craftsman of his time, and one of the best ever. All his designs have superb consistency and even color, and in different optical sizes, as you point out. And they haven’t gone away, but are still a big part of the public face of America.\n\n"

It could be said that the pantograph’s requirement of engineering drawings led to the large drawing offices of ATF and Linotype, with many draftsmen/-women, institutionalizing the process of design direction to a greater degree than when punches were cut by hand.\n\nOne would imagine that slightly earlier, MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan, Philadelphia, 1875, for instance, drawings were made at a large type size—two or four-line pica perhaps—and approved before metalwork began. But the size-specific scaling for smaller sizes would have been left to the experienced discretion of cutters working on a particular size, rather than being capable of calculation and inspection beforehand.\n\nWood type had been made from large drawings, with a pantograph, from the 1830s, but the same “legibility” inference can’t be made as for MFB and the pantograph.\n\nWas one master drawing used for all sizes of an ATF type, mechanically modified in the “output” — or were separate drawings done for each size?\n\nDid Benton do the engineering drawings used by the pantograph, or something smaller? Goudy mentions, in _Goudy’s Type Designs_ that his drawings for Kennerley (1911) were one inch high—so it would appear that a lot was left to the drawing office, and its design director(s), as the engineering drawings for the pantograph were much larger (13”?), which meant that a process of interpretation would have occurred in scaling up Goudy’s drawings, no matter how exquisite they were, or how much larger than the final type.\n\nWhatever, as the chief designer of a large type factory, MFB would have had a greater control of the fine details of all sizes of type than almost any other type designer of his era and earlier—anyone, in fact, who did not cut his own punches.\n\n"

Based on Patricia Cost’s bio of the Bentons (cited and linked above), I \\*think\\* MFB was a reticent typographer. He was many other things other than a type designer. To him, it was a job...a good paying job given to him by his father (that’s conjecture). For this reason, and taking into consideration the factory setting and the pantograph, what you get from Benton is a tendency towards more practical type, without all of the fluff and whimsy that comes from a more obsessive typophile.

I can’t speak for the German legacy, though, and would love to hear if it was done there earlier.

Benton, a world-famous and prolific typeface artist. In addition to Clearface Gothic, Benton also designed classics like Franklin Gothic, Century, and many others. Clearface Gothic is a sans serif typeface with light forms which display the Zeitgeist of the turn of the 20th century. Distinguishing characteristics are the open forms of the a and c, the arched k, and the upward-tilting horizontal stroke of the e. The relatively narrow typeface with its open inner white spaces is extremely legible even in small point sizes. There is no accompanying italic. (Victor Caruso later designed the ITC Clearface and an italic based on the forms of Clearface.) The space-saving Clearface Gothic is good for both headlines and text.”\n\n& the Precision Type “Font Reference Guide” says 1908, by Benton.\n\nMy confusion may stem from Caruso’s work on ITC Clearface. That would have been 1970s, right?\n\nFor what it is worth.\n\nClearface Gothic is a marvelous American display face.

      "content": "Hating to be a piss ant while at the same time defending truth and justice, ;)\n\nI actually think that Clearface preceded Clearface Gothic by a few years, and that they were not actually conceived as parts of a larger type system. Mac McGrew has the Bold serif appearing in 1905, with several other weights and italics following. He says the Gothic was designed in 1908, and cut in 1910. He seems to think it was a lone experiment, since there was only 1 weight cut with limited characters. Does anyone show more than the one weight in the earliest showings (1910)? McGrew could be basing his info only on the metal he had access to.\n\nI guess it’s a semantic thing I’m arguing, since it was such a short time between the release of the serif and sans versions, and they were indeed based on the same skeleton, by the same designer, and given the same name. It might be better to characterize this as the birth of the superfamily; such a thing, while not intended initially for Clearface, grew out of further development of the serif by ITC and sans by Linotype, leading to other efforts more clearly intended to be coordinated from the beginning. Since the Bold serif appeared first, I don’t think we can even say Benton intended the serif family as a large range from the beginning. The Heavy Italic is a slightly different animal, harking back to the loosely-associated groups like AG and Cushing, rather than looking forward to type systems like Franklin Gothic or Century.\n\nWithout notes from MFB describing his intentions, or other correspondence indicating the foundry’s program for Clearface, I suppose this is all esoteric flapping anyway. But I did want to be clear about what was intended then, versus what we perceive now, with dozens of superfamilies as examples.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>a-chirographic/typo-centric features in MFB designs\n\nEben, I don’t think whether features conform or don’t conform to the pen is a particularly relevant issue to understanding Morris Fuller Benton. First, as I pointed out in the ’rule or law’ thread, punch cutters were modifying the pen-drawn line from Jenson on. Second, the demand for advertising faces in the 19th century led to types like the fat faces, slab serifs, and sans serifs and other bold types that I believe are more influenced by sign painting and other built-up lettering than the movement of the pen.\n\nSo I think the departures from the pen are old news by the end of the 19th century, and Benton is generally not concerned with violating or not violating the pen, but is working within the vernacular of his day, of Victorian, Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles.\n\nIt strikes me that he is innovating in two ways. First Benton draws the model letters so that they will scale well. In other words, at small sizes counters will not close up, joins not clot up etc. This I learned from Juliet’s presentation, and I think she put her finger on one of MFB’s real innovations. He takes advantage of the fact that he for the first time can scale type mechanically, and he approaches a set of sizes of a design as a single problem: create a ’master’ for a whole range of sizes. This thinking about a whole family strikes me as something new. I’m sure others will know more about this history, and hopefully enlighten us.\n\nThe other innovation is in his greater control over coherence of design and evenness color in any kind of style. In the Linn Boyd Benton essay quoted in the Cost article, he mentions these qualities as goals in type, and I’m sure his son Morris Fuller held the same view. I suspect that his ability to draw at big sizes and scale down to tiny ones gave him more control than a punch cutter looking through magnification. And he exploited this control to the maximum. You could complain that his type is too smooth and polished, and loses some life. But you can’t complain that it is rough or sloppily drawn. And it is calculated to have even color. For example the fat terminal on the top of the c and C in Franklin Gothic gives them more strength and more color as a serifed C would have, and so it could be argued balances better with the other letters. At least I think that was in MFB’s mind. The variation in form to achieve even color is not an innovation for text faces, but perhaps doing it in such a thorough-going way for display faces is. At any rate, it set a standard.\n\nOf course, taking advantage of the pantographic punch cutter, the Linotype and Monotype drawing offices were turning out very polished type also. But my impression is that Benton was a leader in the early years of the century. Is that right? It seems like by the 20’s, when I guess the competitor of the Ludlow came in, ATF lost its lead, and started to decline.\n\n"

There were dozens of keen and skilled young draftsmen to do drawings for him. What he and his fellow directors at ATF did was to dump most of the types they had inherited and somehow bring into being a range of reliable new faces that appealed to the customer base, and keep innovations coming, unfailingly and regularly.\n\nIt meant fighting back against the Linotype, which had grabbed the market for bulk sales of text sizes, with completely new concepts, like the ‘type families’: printers who bought Cheltenham could be persuaded that they just had to add Cheltenham Bold, and Cheltenham Condensed and so on, all of them made in the big sizes with which the Linotype could never compete, and sold by means of brilliant copywriting and relentlessly repeated direct-mail shots. It was presumably Benton who directed the simplifying of the original fussy artwork for Cheltenham to get a basic design on which to build the variations. Overall it was a high-risk strategy, given the quantity of heavy engineering that was needed to launch even one face successfully in all sizes – but he pulled it off.\n\nIn other words, he is the first and probably the greatest of the 20th-century ‘type directors’, among whom one can name Griffiths at Mergenthaler Linotype, and maybe the Connecticut Yankee Pierpont (along with Morison, and the company secretary Burch – but that’s a more complicated situation) at British Monotype. These were people who could ‘manage design’ successfully in a manner that one recognizes in some other 20th-century industrial contexts.\n\nOf course the result had its downside. Benton’s Bodoni repackaged the (relatively) human original as a wholly mechanical face, ironing out all the personal quirks of the original, such as they were (and which the Bauer version kept). But in many ways that made it all the more usable and universal. Personally I dislike the way in which the banal regularity of Cloister Black drains the type of all the liveliness of its historical model. But there is something deeply reassuring about the sheer self-confident competence of all the ATF faces.\n\nThe answers to some of our practical questions are probably still buried in the ATF type drawings, most of which are indeed in one of the outlying stores of the Smithsonian that are not too accessible right now. They could show us who drew what and when, and what modifications were made for different sizes. I remember looking for the drawings for Cloister Black to see how that awful cap A, with the misplaced left-hand stroke, ever happened. You can just see from the drawing (an image made in minimal light and not good, I’m afraid) that first they drew it right. Then they changed the drawing in order to make it wrong.\n\nBut the design sold and sold. And not just in ATF’s version.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090924025049im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ATF%20Cloister%20Black%20A%20drg%20aa%20-%20500_5315.jpg)\n\n"

Generally, scaling is imagined as ideal outlines getting bigger or smaller, when in fact it was (and still is), a series of letters in a series of sizes made from rather ugly particle placements trying to represent ideal relationships between fonts.\n\nMFB’s solution path, which you see taken in many modern designs, was to find the most economical solution, the one least likely to allow a particle placement failure to interrupt the form at any size within a range of slightly non-linear scalings. MFB’s economy of shape, as is rightly pointed out, came at the expense of evidence-of-hand, but brought economy when the sizes were produced, and he loved it, I’m sure. Goudy, on the other hand, and though pressed to provide a certain economy, could only be sized for considerably more, and he loved it, I’m sure. ;)\n\nCheers!\n\n"

And he shows in re-drawing type for logos how the unity can be enhanced when you have the freedom to alter characters for the best look of a specific word.

What exactly about how he worked leads you to think that he never picked up a pencil? I would think if he had a drawing office for new fonts he would draw a few key characters—such as “agone CHORD”, and then correct others’ drawings as they made the drawings based on these models. If he had an existing design, like Bodoni, then he might just blue pencil the original. But for a new design this wouldn’t be enough.\n\nDesigns like Clearface and Franklin Gothic I thought were new designs, and in any case these clearly have been carefully thought through down to the smallest detail.

I say it’s ’smart’ in the sense that it confers some advantages; not that it is somehow universally ’right’. I think the advantages are that the larger opening may help recognition of the A by a person who is less familiar with this style of lettering. I know that it took me a long time to learn to recognize what certain blackletter caps were and I still have a rough time with some of them. I think that the result of his change is a a sort of Roman A in Blackletter clothing. I can see where that would sell more Cloister for Ads. And to echo previous comments I think it probably did help to resist in buildup. It is striking how the new composition does make your eye cycle around it very smoothly and over & over. The old one holds my eye up at various points.\n\nI also think the little teardrop at the far lower left is interesting too. In the original it isn’t so important because of where the weight of the letter is - mostly on the right - but with the new distribution the need for support moves to the left and the teardrop has to be beefed up.\n\nRE; Being a designer. Even if Benton did not do the drafting, if his ideas were being expressed in the design I am willing to consider him the designer.\n\nI agree that the idea that MFB’s type is often a little too smooth is borne out in this example too.
