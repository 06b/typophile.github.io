The ones I'm thinking of getting are The Elements of Typographic Style - Robert Bringhurst and Thinking with Type : A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, and Students (Design Briefs) - Ellen Lupton.\n\nThanks for your input.\n\n-Will\n\n",

      "content": "both books are very good. thinking with type isnt as in-depth as bringhurst (\"the typographers bible\"), which im still reading. i see it as a lexicon you can always go back to if you're unsure about anything.\n\nit also has a good list of different typefaces suited for text, with short descriptions on their history and which cuts are the best.\n\n"

      "content": "i think _Thinking with Type_ would be a good preface to _The Elements of Typographic Style_. while Bringhurst's book is the \"typographer's Bible\", it can be a lot to chew onâ€¦ but still a definite must-read.\n\nas for actually drawing and creating letters and fonts, the _Logo,Font & Lettering Bible_ will help you to learn more about some of the technical stuff.\n\n----------  \nnc\n\n"
