There are also some interesting inscriptions in the Abbey (which also has one of the finest fan vaulted ceiling anywhere). Unfortunately, most of the secondhand bookshops have closed in the past few years, so I don’t find Bath as much fun as I used to.\n\n"

There is also an exhibition of the Leonardo Codex Leicester at the Chester Beatty library from the 13th June onwards, you have to in advance for this I think.\n\n[http://www.cbl.ie/exhibitions/Temporary.aspx?L1Link=36&L2Link=242&Sb=Tem...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083116/http:/www.cbl.ie/exhibitions/Temporary.aspx?L1Link=36&L2Link=242&Sb=Temporary%20Exhibitions \"http://www.cbl.ie/exhibitions/Temporary.aspx?L1Link=36&L2Link=242&Sb=Temporary%20Exhibitions\")\n\nand of course you have it on your list already but dont miss the Book of Kells :-)\n\nenjoy\n\nMike\n\n"

I was astonished to see the pages stuck full of punctures from use of the compass. What amazing artists they must have been to create the joyful “dancing X” with drawing instruments. It will be intresting to see it again with eyes several decades older.\n\nWe will visit the Long House. My mate loves a good beer, and I intend to give up my customary glass of wine in favor of local beer while in the UK.\n\n"
