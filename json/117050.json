I could not find another similar Becker interpretation, but this font has many alternates and might be similar enough if the matching font does not turn up.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Note that \\_Carpenter Script\\_ has: 1. An alternate \\_I\\_ that is almost identical to the sample. 2. An alternate \\_k\\_ with an upper loop similar to the sample. 3. An alternate \\_f\\_ that is almost identical to the sample. 4. An alternate \\_a\\_ that is is almost identical to the sample. 5. An alternate \\_t\\_ with the cross stroke extended backwards. Slope the phrase less than 5 degrees right and \\_Carpenter Script\\_ looks like a match, with almost no editing required.  \nDon\n\n"
