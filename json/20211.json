Given this range, and to a lesser extent the cultural and philosophical range of the people using the site, there's a lot of fundamental disagreement.\n\nThere are two possible responses for the moderators. The liberal response is to run the site as if beliefs held by users were no more than preferences, not to be arbitrated between from above. The Aristotelian response would have it that all crafts have inherent in them a set of virtues which must be agreed upon for them to be virtues at all; that disputes concerning them should therefore normally be arbitrated as if the differing opinions held were either true or false; that crafts should be separately embodied where the virtues inherent to them clash, as they clearly do with graphic design and text design; and that in each embodiment, some kind of guild-like hierarchy of authority is required to legitimate arbitration.\n\nThough Typophile has a formally designated ruling class, they've taken the liberal path. What follows is disagreement without the possibility of settlement, and this we see endlessly. Typophile is less valuable than it could be for the same reason in miniature that Western government is less valuable than it could be: within its field, it embodies no conception of the good.\n\nPerhaps you didn't want quite that much detail, Patty :-)\n\n"
