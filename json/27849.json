Those fonts were all based on other typefaces, but I never quite figured out what this was based on. Flyer, that E+F no longer sells (not the same as current Linotype one)?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The Heavy is exactly like 'Migra Heavy', so I think there is a common origin. (I have noticed that most TypeShop fonts are not original designs, and seem to be from the Brendel collection.)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
