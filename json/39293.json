The client loved it, however we were forced to change the title as there is already a mag out there with the name (Christian Surfers title).\n\nAnyhow the font is poorly rendered, so I have redrawn it and made some changes in response to peoples posts.\n\nThanks again\n\nLook forward to any thoughts?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [typo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209104440/http:/typophile.com/files/typo_8.jpg) | 91.83 KB |\n\n [‹ How do I make wobbly underscore in InDesign?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209104440/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39428 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Times New Roman's many versions! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209104440/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39087 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "You might want to post a slightly smaller image, but with a uniform white margin running around it. Would make it easier to view.\n\nThe way you’ve done the ’A’ bothers a bit. Somehow it seems horizontally flipped. I think the curving of the apex should be on the left-hand side. You’re probably trying to mirror the lines of the ’R’ on SURF, but it doesn’t work too well.\n\nAlso the weight of the first ’A’ does not match with that of the other characters in the word AUSTRALIA. Have you created it by scaling up the smaller ’A’?\n\nLikewise, the R also may look better if redrawn. Being a curved form, it typically should go a little over the cap-height so that it visually aligns with the more angular characters.\n\n"

      "content": "I see you have chosen a font in which the digraph ’LI” could be easily mistaken for a “U”. It’s probably not such a big deal should someone misread your logo as “SURF AUSTRAUA”, but I recall a video rental store called “Great Flicks” had a sign using a similar font with disastrous results.\n\n"
