That way you can pick a logo designer that’s compatible with what your looking for by first looking at the designs and not the credentials. If you don’t want to pay for the membership, there’s always their book. But if your looking at books then, I’d say take a peek at Los Logos. It’s one of my favorites.\n\n"
