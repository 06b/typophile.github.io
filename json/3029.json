I haven't seen anything that matches all of these letters. Can we suspect a 'manufactured' or mixed font?\n\n"

The fonts are organized by year,   \nwith all of the fonts for a chosen year loading (too slowly) in small   \nflash samples stacked one above the other toward the right side of   \nthe page. Some free fonts, mostly pay fonts.   \n   \nRing any bells?\n\n"
