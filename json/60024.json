I'm not sure what the exact terminology for these characters are, hence I'm at a loss on how to do even a basic Google search.\n\nAttached is a screenshot of [FF Typeface Six](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211727/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_typeface_six/&s=c?&sample_text=cogq&sample_size=144) that contains these characters.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [o!
