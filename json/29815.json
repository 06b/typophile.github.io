It's Monotype Baskerville with serifs chopped off here and there. None of the big foundries seems to have it. Does anybody know it?  \nThanks a lot\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [image.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018092615/http:/typophile.com/files/image.png) | 22.4 KB |\n\n",
