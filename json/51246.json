Glad to have any feedback.  \nIt’s “six-of-one, half-dozen of the other” for me... but I would like to make a decent departure from the original and go with the [bottom-left on v2](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207232805/http:/typophile.com/files/logotype-explorations-v2.gif), or either on [top at v2b](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207232805/http:/typophile.com/files/logotype-explorations-v2b.gif).\n\nThe fonts are Union, Demos Bold, and FF Clan. Maybe switch the FF Clan to Praxis Bold... then fiddle ’til it looks good.\n\nWrapping the “flag stripes on a globe” (US Government... travel... get it?) was the idea for the spherical treatment of the mark in v2b, without making it look like a barber-shop pole. Though users saying “_even their logo is a lemon!_” would be bad too — as they’re getting hammered on usability of the site (that’s the next task).\n\nI could even [animate that globe](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207232805/http:/www.logolounge.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=638), but I’m trying to be somewhat simple and classical and [not trendy](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207232805/http:/www.logolounge.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=607).\n\n"

The color is also nice, although Red & Government seem kind of scary together. My first instinct is that it should be green or blue, but I really like the red.\n\n"
