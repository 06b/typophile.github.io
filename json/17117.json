I just started designing OpenType typefaces and have a problem with the fractions.  \nCan anyone tell me if something is wrong with this:\n\nfeature frac { # Fractions  \n sub [one one.onum] [slash fraction] [two two.onum] by onehalf;  \n} frac;\n\nThanks!  \nPieter\n\n [‹ Harmonizing font names on MS Word Mac/Windows](http://web.archive.org/web/20081029010551/http:/typophile.com/node/17086 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Batch Printing Help ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081029010551/http:/typophile.com/node/17115 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
