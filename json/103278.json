Very popular in the mid 19th century and often classified as Western or Wild West.  \nI did not find an exact match.  \nI found one in a heavier weight, called Cowboy Western, from Font Mesa:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415062138/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/\")  \nThere are also some fonts in the Western category at dafont.com:  \nSaddlebag by Dieter Steffmann, K22 Ambelyn by Toto, & Let Me Ride by Måns Grebäck.  \nDon\n\n"

I'm pretty convinced it is a font and not a hand-lanterring. You can see [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415062138/http:/m.hypebeast.com/2011/1/edison-chen-x-nike-sportswear-destroyer-jacket) some photos of the making process, one showing the typeset under Illustrator. You could also have a look to the video and around 1'09, there's a black flag with the type. That could be useful to printscreen and upload it here to make identification process easier.\n\nEDIT: finally got the sample by myself, can be shown [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415062138/http:/s22.postimg.org/6n3pe342p/image.jpg). Fivos with his tremendous software may help.\n\n"

      "content": "H74 Warriors is a nice font for showing placement of spurs. But the base letterform shown in the sample image is a Roman with a unified base and top for the stems, rather than the split or bifurcated stems used in H74 Warriors. This type of letterform is in the group labelled Tuscan. There was a good discussion of the Tuscan Letterform four years ago at [http://typophile.com/node/41566](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415062138/http:/typophile.com/node/41566 \"http://typophile.com/node/41566\") And for people who read books there is a substantial chapter on the Tuscan letterform in Nicollete Grey's Nineteenth Century Ornamented Type.  \nDon\n\n"

Spur placement and inclusion or not on various strokes varied from font to font.  \nI note that the weight shown in this image is a little heavier than the original image, perhaps due to blurring.  \nPresumably the actual Nike font is a match.  \nBy the way, the letters shown in my previous post would need to be heavier to match the original image and the serifs adjusted to match.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "If you are happy with Stahl's Tiffany -- a Tuscan with split stems rather than the flat ends used on the Nike jacket -- this simplifies your font search. However, if some of the comments I encountered in a web search are accurate, Stahl's Tiffany is popular with makers of T-shirts and other casual items but they find it difficult to purchase separately.  \nThis is not a major problem as the general design of spurred Tuscan fonts has been generic since the mid 19th century. It should not be too difficult to find a spurred Tuscan with low contrast and weight similar to the Nike font and Stahl's Tiffany for purchase, or even a free version with sufficient quality. A search of Myfonts using \"Wild West\" produced several spurred Tuscans that you might review: Hessian, Miss. Scarlett, URW Wood Type, Saloon Girl, Buckhorn, H74 Warriors [mentioned already by Ryuk], and Saloon. Dafont has similar free versions.  \nDon\n\n"

Only the tail on Q is a complete unknown.  \nAs far as I understand copyright law [American & related] there is no restriction on creating a font, or an eps file, based on an image.
