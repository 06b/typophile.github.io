      "content": "Joe is right, this is dangerous ground, so anything we contribute will be anecdotal and without scientific foundation.\n\nWith that in mind, if a font is legible for text setting at 10pt, then making it larger should be okay. Line-length and leading will likely be the gotchas. Assuming the same viewing distance as an unimpaired reader, you’d put less words on a line. As for leading?\n\nApart from that the other common sense answer might be to use signage fonts – so your open, humanist sans, might be a good approach. But I’d be nervous about these in text settings – for short passages and headings you should be okay.\n\n"

I’ve heard even more people say (without me asking :-) that [Delicious](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907012101/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html) does a great job for people who are visual impaired. Maybe Jesper can give it a test run.\n\n"

Although it’s meant for children, it’s designed so that the characters are easily recognizable and distinguishable from each other. In that sense it might also work for people with some form of visual impairment. There are also different versions.\n\n"
