Info on the movie at [http://www.thesamecinemaeverynight.net/gentlemen-in-white-vests-1970/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131122125324/http:/www.thesamecinemaeverynight.net/gentlemen-in-white-vests-1970/ \"http://www.thesamecinemaeverynight.net/gentlemen-in-white-vests-1970/\").  \nThis seems to be packaging added later, perhaps by a British distributor.  \nCould possibly be a British font like Johnston or Gill Sans, edited to remove the bar on the G. and point the tips on M, N, V & W. Johnston was commissioned by Frank Pick of London Underground Railways in 1916 for use in signs on the railway system. Original name\"Underground.\" A.k.a. \"Johnston's Railway Type.\" Versions by ITC, P22 and others. Gill was originally produced for the London & North Eastern Railway, and widely used.  \nBut then again, it is perhaps another sans.  \nDon\n\n"
