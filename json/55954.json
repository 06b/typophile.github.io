May be sans or serif...\n\nI've been looking at Optima, but I don't really like for the lack of true italic. Otherwise shapes could complement each other.\n\nSo I'm looking for other alternatives as well.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

I'm working on a magazine targeted at affluent readers. I didn't want to go with something usual. I've chosen Berkeley because of it's character and stroke modulation beauty. But I also need a different one to complement it. Either contrast or just sans serif with same overall contrast/colour.\n\nI hope this helps. Oh. One more thing. Affluent readers yes, but content will not be about fashion and accessories. So I immediately put all Script/Swash/Modernist (like Bodoni) fonts out.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

You've added ČčŠšŽž with it. :)\n\nWhat do others think about pairing it with Museo? I used 300 and 500 weight...\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
