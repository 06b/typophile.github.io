  "content": "An entertaining font, and refreshing to see something of a slab-serif when most bitmaps we see lately are sans.   \n   \nLooking at the word \"Pfospfor,\" it appears to have a jumping rhythm due to the f and p not lining up with the other characters. I suppose this feature really stands out because the serifs create such horizontal movement.   \n   \nWhy truncate the ascenders and descenders? Allowing them to increase by one pixel will open up the design and allow the p, q, g, f, and t to hit their appropriate marks on the baseline and xheight.   \n   \nI've taken the liberty to test it- Here is a comparison...   \n   \n ![font sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414161740im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/183.gif)   \n   \nThe other challenge here is spacing. Because of the variety of shapes, one can't assume that each character would have one pixel of spacing between it and the next. Some characters might require 1 pixel, and others wouldn't require any because of the serifs.   \n   \nWhere do you see the design going? Do you have any other weights or sizes in mind?   \n   \njb\n\n",

      "content": "Your advice to add a pixel to the ascenders and descenders is helpful.   \n   \nIt seems there are two directions I could take...   \n   \nOne is to add the pixels you prescribe, which adds overall height to the face. Good for readability but not always optimal in bitmap font design.   \n   \nThe alternative would be to make the x-height consistent, like you suggest, and eliminate key serifs to accommodate the short height. (So, for example, the ascender on the lc f doesn't run into it's own cross stroke.)   \n   \nDon't even talk to me about kerning yet. Heh.   \n   \nAnd weights? I started a 10 point but thought I'd hold off until I get the smallest size (7 point) completed since the most constraints exist at the smallest sizes...   \n   \n//jp\n\n"
