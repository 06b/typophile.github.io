Any guesses or suggestions for a digital font that has the same \"feel\".   \n   \nThe sample was about 8 point type so the scan is rather rough.   \n   \n ![Mizrahi](http://web.archive.org/web/20141102004021im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/32874.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "The logo for Isaac Mizrahi was designed by Tibor Kalman, with Douglas Riccardi in 1990. It seems it was drawn using Bodoni as a model, with a few alterations, note the distinct shapes of the R, Z, C, as well as the M.   \n   \nHere's an excerpt from \"Tibor Kalman: Perverse Optimist\"   \n\"...The M&Co redesign drew from the whimsical functionalism of Mizrahi's fashion, taking the designer's name in Bodoni and \"screwing with its proportions,\" as Kalman put it, \"intentionally taking something elegant and replacing it with human hands.\"   \n   \nMizrahi also adds; \"It's just Bodoni with a splayed \"M\" that he [Kalman] invented.\"\n\n"
