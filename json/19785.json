More, I do not know.  \nIf the 6 fonts are given different colors, overlaps, swashes and ligatures could be fantastically demonstrated. If one or more fonts is whitened, the writing could be secured. The more the whites, the higher the security?!  \nHappy Layering with [Flowers](http://web.archive.org/web/20061127143426/http:/www.crauswords.com/flowers/WFlowers.htm)\n\n"
