  "content": "Ok, this will be wildly similar to a post of mine from a week or two ago, but now with sans serif fonts.\n\nI suppose some could call this the lazy way to find a suitable type, but you guys save me a lot of time and I know that most of your recommendations are solid types.\n\nWe have a creative brief for a rebrand of a corporate mark –&nbsp;the current mark being set in Univers. The client really likes more unique / memorable type... probably as a backlash against years under the regime of Univers.\n\nSo, I am looking for some nice modern / conetmporary sans typefaces that maintain a sense of the corporate world while offering unique forms as well. I would love your input to aid in my search, you guys usually do right by me.\n\nlet me know, thanks.\n\nbtw, I fell in love with Lexicon which I had not seen up until the week of my similar post geared towards serif’d types.\n\n",

I feel like the Stalemate will fall too closely there.\n\nI do like Sophisto quite a bit, but it may be too far away from corporate for them, I am checking out the site though, looks like some good stuff is around.\n\nI am hoping to find something with the impact, of, well, IMPACT. But a bit more unique and contemporary... if that helps?\n\n"
