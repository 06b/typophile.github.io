Some characters/terminals suggest it might have started out with Rotis in mind once, cf. its [Semi Serif Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20120505163019/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/rotis_semi_serif_by_adobe_std_65_bold/&sample_text=Consolidatemydebt.co.uk) (there is no Rotis Black, and of course no ‘Schoolbook’ style with single-storey ‘a’ either).\n\nFor a lusty semi-serif, have a look at [Areplos](http://web.archive.org/web/20120505163019/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/typefaces-45-areplos-text-pro-bold) by [Jan Solpera](http://web.archive.org/web/20120505163019/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jan%20Solpera).\n\n"
