Apparently they moaned that Bald Condensed doesn't get updated as often (heck it's been over a year! :^( ). (I've been hunting high and low for a copy of the mag but can't find it anywhere in Gent. Could somebody please make a scan of the relevant page and send it to me -- I'd really like to see that. Thanks.)  \nI finally managed to obtain a copy of the mag, so it's not necessary anymore.\n\n",
