The closest I have found is a Zapf Chancery Roman, but it is not quite it as in that font the upper left in the Zapf Chancery has two serifs and the upper right does not have the more rounded (circle).\n\nIf any one has any ideas I am most appreciative.\n\nThanks.\n\nWilly\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071011061137im_/http:/typophile.com/files/V-Font.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Times italic lookalike - Times (metal version) {Raph}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071011061137/http:/typophile.com/node/18664 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Peak\" geometric sans - Futura {Tiff} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071011061137/http:/typophile.com/node/18689 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It was a garden variety TNR italic.\n\nWhat was throwing us off, was that it was used in a logo as a Capital letter and we kept looking a capitals in fonts trying to ID it, and never thought about it being a lower case that was sized up to match the other capitals.\n\nPulling it out by itself for others to look at I guess it was quite obvious. Sometimes you just can’t see the forest for the trees. Thanks again.\n\n"
