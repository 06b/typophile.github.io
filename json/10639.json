      "content": "O.K. lots of people are going to disagree with me now, but anyway....   \n  \nI think a fundamental understanding of writing is needed before one can begin to design typefaces. Writing, whether with a calligraphic pen or other tools help establishing a kinesthetic understanding, or, a feel for proportions and flow. Writing with a broad-edge pen will help you to appreciate the principles behind thick-thin transitions, which is essential for designing serifed text faces. A good writing manual would certainly help. Edward Johnston's _Writing and illuminating, and lettering_ might be a good place to start, or Gerrit Noordzij's _Stoke of the pen_, or other good calligraphy books. After getting to grips with the principles of writing, lettering could follow. Lettering could be seen as a liberation from writing, to free oneself from the bounds of the writing instrument, but still retaining a strong tie with the fundamental principles of writing. Experimentations and explorations could then follow.   \n  \nFontLab is a very sophisticated piece of software for making cutting-edge digital faces, but as a design tool it's a bit counter-intuitive. I prefer working out ideas on paper first, scan it and take it from there.   \n  \nOf course I haven't talked about spacing and kerning yet! I have no idea... I just do it by eye. But I think I did learn a lot about spacing from doing calligraphy (again, I think it's a kinesthetic thing) and rubbing down Letraset! Oh yeah, look at Walter Tracy's _Letters of Credit_. Also _Twentieth century type designers_ by Sebastian Carter will give you a lot of insights about how different type designers work and give you lots of inspiration!   \n  \nHope this helps. Gook luck!\n\n"

I gave up on scanners several years ago, when I discovered that even quite expensive ones introduce distortions by compressing or expanding in one direction. These days, if I draw on paper at all, I only make rough drawings to get the shape down: then I prop the drawing beside my screen and use it as a visual guide to create the shape on the computer. It was only after I had been doing this for a couple of years that I read a comment by Hermann Zapf regarding the kind of drawings he prepared for a manual punchcutter, as contrasted with those prepared for industrial production. The drawings for industrial production needed to be very clean and precise, because the individual operating the pantograph, camera, Ikarus tablet or scanner (depending on the era) was neither qualified nor expected to _interpret_ the design, only to reproduce it as exactly as possible. A good punchcutter, however, is an expert interpreter: able to take a designer's quite rough drawing and create a workable typeface from it, glyph by glyph, on the end of little pieces of steel. As a result, Zapf says his drawings for the brilliant punchcutter August Rosenberger, with whom he worked for many years, were much rougher than he needed to produce for mechanical production. I believe the same is true in digital type design, especially when one is making one's own outlines: it is not necessary to produce perfect drawings if one develops the ability to interpret rough drawings directly with the computer tools.\n\n"

I refer to \"Script\" forms who imitate writing and so on, generally all fancy lettering stuff. Just try to draw directly on screen something like Zapfino, ex Ponto, Sanvito, Caflish Script...   \n   \nThe best, is to know perfectly the limitations of the tools you use (because you know them), and use the most adapted to your whishes rather than trying to do something with a tool who make your life more complicate.   \n   \nTo comeback to non experienced designers.

For example, when you're drawing an italic, there's no use normalizing the angles on paper.   \n   \nOn the other hand, certain types of designs (like highly irregular ones) might benefit from \"finished\" drawings.   \n   \nI use paper myself, but really only because drawing software isn't very good (yet).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "All of the above seems true. There are good arguments for all these points. Everyone finds their own way that works best for them.   \n   \nI think, as a beginner, drawing has more freedom and can help to identify clear objectives about what one may want out their design. Experienced designers might be able to draw directly on the computer because they know where points should land after having placed thousands of them. The beginner does not have this in their arsenal yet. So I still see scanning as a good way to start even if it is necessary to interpret these to accommodate for scanner distortion.   \n   \nIs is necessary to draw every character perfectly before moving to the computer? No. But but defining clear characteristics of your design does seem important to me. After these characteristics, such as a serif for example, are discovered, defined, whatever it is easy to copy and paste these in the computer from glyph to glyph. But do not do this for everything. You don't want your \"m\" to be two \"n\"s stuck together.   \n   \nHenriko, however you start, start with the words \"hamburefonts\" or \"handgloves\".   \n   \nStart with lowercase then move to the uppercase.   \n   \n-smc\n\n"
