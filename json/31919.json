  "content": "Does anybody know of a font similar to Trump Medieval that might fix my predicament? Or maybe just offer a suggestion. I’m trying to squeeze this letters together really tight, and it’s causing some unappealing results. I’ve circled the parts in the attachment that are bugging me. I can break it apart, and tweak it in Illustrator, but I have some other places where I’ll be using the same typeface. I would like them to come together easily for a straight kind of “bridge” effect with the text, if you know what I mean. Thanks a bunch!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090611090543im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bridge_5349.gif)\n\n",

Another typeface with bracketed serifs. If all else fails, I’ll just keep it the way it is. I don’t feel like changing all the R’s.\n\n"

When the transition from the stem to the serif is “curvy” and gradual, then the serif is said to be _bracketed._ When the transition is abrupt, as in a design like Trump Mediaeval, then it is said to have _unbracketed_ serifs.\n\n— K.\n\n"

      "content": "I think Trump Medieval is quite interesting. It’s not the square serifs alone but also the proportions of the letterforms: narrow B E R against wide D G.\n\nCouldn’t you just modify the R’s end (lift it up) and cut off the G’s bottom serif (or lift it a bit so it sits higher than the E’s serif) in Illustrator?\n\nEven if you space versals tightly: BR is too close, and RI too wide. As to DG, I would overlap the curves completely. (I have no image at hand, but if you go [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090611090543/http:/www.kltf.de/kltf_litteratra.htm) and then click on “glyph set” in the top right menu, there are DO OC OG ligatures which may illustrate what I mean.)\n\nKarsten\n\n"
