  "content": "Hello guys et gals—\n\nSo Neue Helvetica is the operating system font that replaces Lucida Grande. Let’s hope the Apple Helvetica variant has glyph compatibility with Lucida Grande (similarly extended) and is properly hinted.\n\nOh and it would be really nice if Apple made some architectural improvements to the OS type engine too.\n\nDiscuss amongst yourselves,\n\nMikey :-)\n\n",
