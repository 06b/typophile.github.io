Also I know that before using this font, McDo old lookalike font was: \"Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk\"\n\nThis one is much more modern.. the capital R, is straight.. looks great. Thx for the help!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701130744im_/http:/typophile.com/files/whatsthisfont_4988.jpg)\n\n",
