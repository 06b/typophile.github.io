Quantico is an angular typeface family that was inspired by old beer packaging and military lettering. It utilizes 30 degree angles and completely straight lines to form unique character shapes. Equally at home in text or display settings, Quantico includes 3 alternate characters as well as several ligatures.\n\nBuy and preview it now at [Youworkforthem](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127032151/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0103) and [Myfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127032151/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/quantico)\n\nAnd don't forget to stay tuned to my latest efforts via [www.madtype.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127032151/http:/www.madtype.net/ \"www.madtype.net\") and my recently implemented blog.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [quantico.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127032151/http:/typophile.com/files/quantico.pdf) | 306.36 KB |\n\n",

It will be the same PDF that Myfonts uses for their \"gallery\" image.\n\nThe fonts have a full character set (pretty much everything here sans some of the mathematical characters: [http://www.alanwood.net/demos/macroman.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127032151/http:/www.alanwood.net/demos/macroman.html \"http://www.alanwood.net/demos/macroman.html\")). The Myfonts character set viewer does not currently support referenced characters in OT fonts, so you won't be able to see the accented characters there yet on their site. But they are there. Myfonts has informed me that it will be a couple of months before that is fixed.\n\nP.S. I think the lowercase g makes the font also. Be sure to check it out in the PDF.\n\n"

It's more about the underlying simplicity and elegance of something that may be regarded as violent or rudimentary at a glance. :-)\n\nI would call this genre Blocky Sans or Geometric.\n\n"
