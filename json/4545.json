Instead I decided to opt for a typographic solution.   \n   \nI played around with Avant Garde and came up with the idea of using the registered trademark symbol to symbolise a golf ball.   \n   \nIt is a work in progress, it is in black and white for the moment.   \n   \n ![First Idea](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143311im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34745.gif)   \n   \n ![Second Idea](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143311im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34746.gif)   \n   \n   \nWhat do you think??

I like nothing about it.   \nI have seen some interesting Golf related logos over the years and the most memorable was a golfball shaped like an egg (oval). I do not recall what it was for. Perhaps it was something about a nest, or what came first the....or ...   \nSomething clever in that direction would be worth trying.   \nBtw. I am guessing the L you have is supposed to look like a club with the tilt it has? A bit of a stretch for most folks I would guess.   \nYou could try simple type with a club replacing the L. not a tilted L., or how about no O just the dimples from a golfball.\n\n"

      "content": "Geoff:   \n   \nThis is the first time in a while that I think Avant Garde is an appropriate choice for logotype. As you indicated in your original post, this is a work-in-progress, and as the rest of the posts indicate, you still have a lot of work to do.   \n   \nI like Avant Garde because it is a clean typeface which is appropriate for the golfing community. I also like the implications of balls (we all know what I mean here) created by the circular letterforms. I would suggest exploring more subtle approaches to manipulating the type than what you have done, thus far.   \n   \nThe \"W\" with the \"R-ball\" implies a bouncing ball, which I don't think is the most beautiful shot to highlight. If I was showcasing a shot I think it would either be a long drive, or a perfect putt. The drive would require an arc and the putt would require a hole. I don't know if either of these would work into this logo, but you might sketch out a few ideas.   \n   \nThe \"L-club\" looks much more like a hockey stick to me. That starts alluding to Happy Gilmore, which albeit is a classic in my eyes, but I don't know how the more serious golfing community views that one.   \n   \nProbably the most simple solution is to put some dimples in the \"O\" and call it good, but my guess is that the \"O\" in golf has been used as a golf ball hundreds of times over (but I can't support that with any research at this time). As I mentioned above, I like the concept of implied balls and subtle letterform manipulation.   \n   \nGood luck! I'm anxious to see what you come up with.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

I want to find an unique, original solution to this problem.   \n   \nHmm, although Golf is considered an upscale sport, alot of people dont consider it upscale.

This gives it some purpose (clarifying the tee of the mark) vs. just repeating the existing mark in a weaker fashion. If you did this, you might also try typing golfweb really small and repeating it across the bottom edge of the card so that it is like grass. Also, centering it isn't very interesting.   \n   \n2 Maybe you can type golfweb really small and repeat it so that it floods the card (grass), except for a round circle that represents a golf ball. You can even make the type get a little larger from top to bottom representing perspective.   \n   \n...just brainstorming thoughts.   \n   \nAloha!\n\n"

I'd suggest moving the logotype 'golfweb' to the info side of the card (leave the icon on the back). And then do \\*not\\* use the same typeface for the person's name. Even with the two-side approach, I think using the type for the name dilutes the ID system too much.   \n   \n- while not as critical as the b-card, I might swap sides on the envolope.   \n   \nThe golfball looks great. Overall, this is reallly nice. Great job.\n\n"

I am really really new to typography. Any ideas?   \n   \nIt is early in the morning. Tired, the only thing I can think of at the moment is a nice monoweight old style or a stab serif, so it would contrast the sans serif so they go together with more harmony then a transitional/modern.   \n   \nCheers.\n\n"
