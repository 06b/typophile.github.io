      "content": "Since in many ways a dash functions like a parenthesis, to signal a thought related to, but not essential to the main sentence, does this mean that you also would not start a line with a parenthetical comment?\n\nThe way we use to handle this with TeX was to put in a whopping penalty for breaking a line immediately before a dash, and a small penalty for breaking after the dash -- as you may know, TeX uses a paragraph optimization routine which is programmable. So, if a line broke before the dash -- it started a new line -- we were pretty sure that any other decision would involve a huge compromise.\n\nTo James: if making a line is the only way out of your pagination problem, and that's the only place you can make a line, go ahead & break after the dash.\n\nWhich isn't to say somebody won't criticize it. One of my favorite stories was where an editor marked our proof \"P.E. -- hyphenated last word,\" and \"P.E. -- loose line.\" I assure you, the last word in the paragraph we hyphenated was quite long; over six letters went down. Now, did the editor think that line above was going to set any tighter if we took down more letters (didn't hyphenate)? Oh, and did I mention there were only two lines in that paragraph?\n\nWhat we wound up doing was to take down the entire word, which meant using about an em-space between words in that first line. We also disallowed the PE, & made them take is as an Editor's Alteration.\n\n"

      "content": "I like Bruce's explanation in the thread Florian has linked to:\n\n_I have always gone by the notion that written words are a way of capturing speech and making it live again in the brain of the reader. If the dash is supposed to convey a sense of pause, then it seems to me to be more effective at the end of the first line. This way the reader encounters the pause indicator, then takes a brief moment to move back over to the next line, and the elapsed time is slightly longer. Encountering it at the beginning of the next line comes as more of a surprise. Therefore, in my style book the dash is always best located at the end of the first line, but if spacing conditions make that ungraceful or impratical, then it goes at the beginning of the next line. The tiniest of subtleties, this, but fun to think about!_\n\nQuite articulate, that Bruce.\n\n"

You use two dashes only when the sentence continues after the \"parenthetical\" remark.\n\nThe usual \"rule\" against beginning a line with a dash is not a grammatical one, but typographic: the dash seems to weaken the text edge. What is so often forgotten is that line-breaking almost always involves a series of typographic compromises. If you want to use em-spaces to justify a line in order to avoid beginning a line with a dash, that's your business. Just remember that ironclad rules also have consequences.\n\n"

      "content": "This is one reason to use shorter (perhaps 3/4) em dashes flanked with some amount of space. In the middle of a measure, it might ultimately occupy the same length as an unspaced, full em dash, but when it falls at the end of a line, the right flanking space can be removed, giving you a shorter irreducible unit. Might not help much, but it's something.\n\n"

Compromising is rarely served by a hierarchy of rules.\n\nSo. If you are setting justified copy, you have two main tools for justification. One is to simply vary the word space. The other is to rewrite the copy for a better fit. But if you're a typesetter rather than an author, you cannot rewrite copy -- Ah, but in effect, that's what hyphenation does -- makes two shorter words where there use to be one long one.\n\nIf you don't hyphenate, you're going to have lines with a lot of word space variation. Some of them will be quite loose, some quite tight. Yes, with some layout programs, you can also letterspace or scale glyphs. I am not a fan of either if it shows, and it doesn't take much to show.\n\nBTW, setting ragged just moves the variance of word spacing to the amount of raggedness on the right margin.\n\nAs for the 3/4 em dash on an em body, you have to draw it up. See **dashes**\n\n[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3640659.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154342/http:/www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3640659.html \"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3640659.html\")\n\nBTW, please get the ebook -- I get some royalties for that, nothing for the print edition.\n\n"
