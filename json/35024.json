The files’ modification dates show March 2007, where my older Adobe files show 2003. I don’t want to replace my existing files, but at the same time, don’t want to have issues with older fonts.\n\nI notice that some faces are “new” additions, while some have been dropped; Adobe Garamond Pro, for example, is included on the disk, but only in four weights (regular/italic/bold/bolditalic), while their earlier release (which I think came with CS2) includes the semibold/semibolditalic weights. Nueva Std, on the other hand, includes four new weights: boldcondensed, boldcondensedoblique, condensed, and condensedoblique. And they’ve thrown in venerable fonts like Prestige Elite — I’m hoping the metrics haven’t gone all wonky and will screw up older docs (though I’ll leave the PostScript version on my system just in case).\n\n [‹ Where to post kerning bugs in Adobe fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825142119/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35132 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fontlab and Python versions ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825142119/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35164 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

(I believe this is a common practice among editors/publishers, not necessarily because of eventual metric changes between font versions)\n\n"

I know the range and quality of designs aren’t there yet, but for specific clients (maybe nonprofits who need to repurpose the work for lots of different media, but don’t have a budget to buy fonts themselves), it might on occasion make sense to limit oneself to fonts available under those licensing terms, in exchange for the added flexibility and, dare I say, freedom.\n\n"

If the “Number of Copies” becomes an issue, one can always do the other way around: store text files next to the fonts’ backup, detailing where and when they were used. This practice also has the benefit of helping the font licensor calculate how much return s/he got from them.\n\n"
