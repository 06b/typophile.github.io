  "content": "Hi everybody\n\nI am looking for a font that looks similar to Avant Garde and Futura, but less mannered and feminine. Something bold, plain and geometric, yet distinct. (No trendy bubbles, and no square gridnik)\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nAny new, good fonts that might be a little ahead of the trend?\n\n(It is for a big, effective and experienced company that does indoor plumbing for public buildings and projects)\n\n",
