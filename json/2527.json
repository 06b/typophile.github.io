  "content": "Hi all,   \n   \nFirst of all, a merry christmas and a happy new year to you all.   \n   \nI was browsing the web looking for info about dyslexia. Suddenly I found smth very interesting.   \nNatascha Frensch, a Dutch designer made a typeface for dyslectic people, called 'Read'.   \n   \nYou can find more info here:   \n [http://www.readregular.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013032841/http:/www.readregular.com/)   \n   \nA lot of care is given to 'b' and 'd' kind of problems. People with dyslexia have problems with characters that look alike.   \nSo a 'd' is not just a mirrored 'b' but it needs more characteristics to distinguish it from the 'b'. Same goes for 'p' and 'q' etc.   \n   \nI love this initiative. Maybe some of you have interesting things to say about this. I myself do not design type, I just use it as a graphic designer.\n\n",

      "content": "_People with dyslexia have problems with characters that look alike._   \n   \nThe biggest problem I have with Frensch's project is that it is so poorly documented that it is impossible to tell whether the design decisions actually address anything more than a particular sub-problem of a particular kind of dyslexia. Even if you look at the rather sparse information on dyselxia provided at [http://www.readregular.com/english/dyslexia.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013032841/http:/www.readregular.com/english/dyslexia.html) it isn't at all clear how differentiating letterforms in the way Frensch has done addresses any of the reading disorder symptoms illustrated there.\n\n"
