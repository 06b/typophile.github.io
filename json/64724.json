  "content": "This isn't related to type, but some of you must've dealt with this before. THANKS in advance!\n\nBelow is a spread I'd like to include in my book. The topic here is retro costume influences. I'd like to refer to the silent film era and the Art Nouveau classics of Mucha. How do I find out if I'm allowed to use these 100-year-old images?\n\nOn the left is an image of an obscure (in this country) silent film star with the look I wanted. I found the high-res image posted on a Flickr site that was an homage to the era. I asked the owner where this image came from, if it was copyrighted, and could I print it. Got no response, which makes me wonder if it IS copyrighted.\n\nOn the right are Mucha art images I've seen on several websites, but will printing them high-res (in black and white) get me into trouble with the Mucha Museum, for instance?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022064044im_/http:/typophile.com/files/14-15_6406.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Anything pre-1927 has passed into the public domain. After 1927 things get messy depending on what country you’re in, what country the item was created/copyrighted in, and whether or not the copyrights have been renewed over the years. But there’s a nasty catch—reproductions of the images are copyrighted. For example, you can’t just scan a photo out of a book to reproduce without permission; you would need to photograph or scan a work yourself.\n\nI would be very careful about reprinting the images from Flickr. Sure they might be posted by someone scanning his antique photos, but they could also be Corbis stock photos that got posted to the internet. If you really need to use them and can’t get clear copies, consult a copyright lawyer before you print them. As for the Mucha images, contact the museum; most museums will sell you their images for very reasonable fees that they very much deserve given the cost and effort of preserving and photographing.\n\n"

It's always a joy to see something like that popping into my mail box -- I always zoom in on every tiny detail, to really appreciate individual brush strokes from up close. Not something you could pull off in a museum, peering over paintings with a huge magnifier.\n\n"

Maybe not! Especially since they are black & white, only 2 inches high.\n\nThe film star is not one of the well-known Hollywood names like Theda Bara. She is Russian, and I haven't found that picture anywhere on the Internet except that one Flickr page. I wonder: if I posterize the image, would it be diffent enough from the original to not even count. Consult a copyright lawyer? I would rather delete the image from the page, it's not crucial.\n\nThanks everyone.\n\n"
