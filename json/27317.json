It might need a horizontal line (instead of a curve) on the bottom, to serve as the beginning of the N. You could try minimizing the S more. Make it thinner possibly. You've got to play with the form of that bottom piece so it conveys the N more instantly.\n\nOtherwise, it's a pretty good integration. A few tweaks and you should have it.\n\n"
