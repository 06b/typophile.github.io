  "content": "I've reviewed other threads here about using Python scripts for generating compostes efficiently; I use the scripts and they have saved me a lot of time. Well, I have been using them, except now that I'm in FLS5, I find my old standby script is refusing to actually place references for base and accent shapes in the small cap positions. It goes through the motions of filling the glyph slots, but they end up empty. All my files (alias.dat, encoding, and python script) agree as far as glyph names, and I'm using the same name convention as always for my small caps (a.sc, b.sc, c.sc), so nothing has changed on my end, except the FL version. Is there some new method for assembling composites, other than using anchors? I've even been able to correctly position the accents in y over small caps in the past using this script, and it still works (sometimes) in FL 4.6, but I'd like to keep working in FLS5. Any ideas?\n\n",
