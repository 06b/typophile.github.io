When I select from the ot palette in adobe illustrator, for instance /r.alt/r.alt/ and then select something different like r.alt02 then instead of getting: /r.alt/r.alt/r.alt02 I get: /r.alt02/r.alt02/r.alt02 so it changes all alts before it. Another way might be /p.end/p.end and the selecting q.swsh instead of /p.end/p.end/q.swsh I get /p.swsh/p.swsh/q.swsh\n\nI’m guessing that I set up the aalt feature wrong?\n\nsub r from [r r.alt r.alt02 r.start r.end r.startswsh r.endswsh];\n\nIs this not correct? - Jess\n\n [‹ fontlab question contours don't close/connect](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121135804/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49980 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Building a Unicase/Allcaps Opentype font with multiple alternates ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121135804/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49948 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The aalt feature should give you little arrows in the glyph palette by each glyph that has alternates and clicking the arrow produces a submenu of those alternates. The aalt feature shouldn’t be in the opentype menu at all. There is a salt feature for Illustrator there, but that’s different.  \nWhat features do you have in this font?\n\n"

      "content": "k.l, I don’t have InDesign so I can’t say.\n\nStephen, Yes, the glyph palette in Illustrator. Exactly, it’s not in the menu it works just like your explaining.\n\nThe problem happens when two or more alts are selected together for instance: I spell Betty and highlight the two t’s and select from the pop out glyph menu the extra swashy t\\_t. That works so I decide to change the y to the extra swashy ending y from the pop out menu and when I do that the y is fine but the extra swashy t\\_t behind it turns into t.alt So it’s now Bety. Since I have removed all other features but the aalt from the font, the only explanation can be that the aalt feature is doing this.\n\nI’ve created many opentype fonts with the aalt feature but usually with just one or two alternates to choose from. This font I’m working on, one glyph can have up to 5 alternates.\n\nfeature aalt {  \n sub A from [A.alt A.alt02];  \n sub B from [B.alt];  \n sub K from [K.swsh];  \n sub L from [L.swsh];  \n sub M from [M.alt M.alt02];  \n sub N from [N.alt N.alt02];  \n sub Q from [Q.swsh];  \n sub R from [R.swsh];  \n sub a from [a.startswsh a.endswsh];  \n sub b from [b.startswsh b.endswsh];  \n sub c from [c.startswsh c.endswsh];  \n sub d from [d.startswsh d.endswsh];  \n sub e from [e.startswsh e.endswsh];  \n sub f from [f.startswsh f.endswsh];  \n sub g from [g.alt g.startswsh g.endswsh];  \n sub h from [h.startswsh h.endswsh];  \n sub i from [i.startswsh i.endswsh];  \n sub j from [j.startswsh j.endswsh];  \n sub k from [k.alt k.startswsh k.endswsh];  \n sub l from [l.start l.alt\\_end l.startswsh l.endswsh];  \n sub m from [m.startswsh m.endswsh];  \n sub n from [n.startswsh n.endswsh];  \n sub o from [o.alt o.startswsh o.endswsh];  \n sub p from [p.startswsh p.endswsh];  \n sub q from [q.startswsh q.endswsh];  \n sub r from [r.alt r.alt02 r.start r.startswsh r.endswsh];  \n sub s from [s.startswsh s.endswsh];  \n sub t from [t.alt t\\_t.alt t\\_t t.startswsh t.endswsh];  \n sub u from [u.startswsh u.endswsh];  \n sub v from [v.alt v.alt\\_startswsh v.startswsh v.endswsh];  \n sub w from [w.alt w.alt\\_startswsh w.startswsh w.endswsh];  \n sub x from [x.startswsh x.endswsh];  \n sub y from [y.alt y.alt02 y.startswsh y.endswsh];  \n sub z from [z.alt z.startswsh z.endswsh];  \n} aalt;\n\nThe reason I didn’t set up the swsh feature for the lowercase letters is because it’s just too much, it’s better if it’s used sparingly and selectively.\n\n"

So I did sub r.alt from [r.alt02]; and that fixes the problem for that, although the fact that it is a problem is puzzling. Having the swsh feature listed makes more sense. Maybe if I move the start and end swashes to a stylistic set it will fix that problem too. - Jess\n\n"
