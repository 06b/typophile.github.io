  "content": "\\blocklyn.jpg {blocklyn copyright (c) Per Ekengren}   \nI wanted to make a typeface by blocks. But not too oblique as a square pixelfont, just a little bit more \"curved\" (you read sexy ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016002442im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) )   \n   \nI know some of the letters are totally wierd when looking at the whole typeface. But just drop me down with your critique.\n\n",

I don't think anyone has done \"kitchen-tile\" dingbats before; that might be a good direction.   \n   \nAs far as the font itself goes, I think I've seen so many grid-based typefaces (and created more than my share!) that it didn't turn my crank so much. My favorite non-dingbat glyph was the zero, and if you could do a whole character set utilizing those spiked forms, that would be pretty neat.\n\n"
