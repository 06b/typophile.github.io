  "content": "Hello there guys, i'm really wanting to purchase Doyald Young's books, but they aren't the easiest to find, especially in Europe. I found this website, and they have the boxed set for sale: [http://www.doyaldyoung.com/DYC01.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130816232648/http:/www.doyaldyoung.com/DYC01.html \"http://www.doyaldyoung.com/DYC01.html\")\n\nHowever, there is zero contact information on the site, and i'm a little wary spending $300 when I don't even know if i'll get the item, I don't see the boxed set for sale anywhere else like Amazon. For this type of purchase I would want to track it and insure it, but there are no options for that.\n\nDoes anyone know if the site is legit? Or if there is anywhere else I can buy the boxed set?\n\nThanks!\n\n-Josh\n\n",

      "content": "I found two of the books on ebay. All three of the books (not as a set) can be found at various booksellers on abe.com (owned by Amazon). You could save a few dollars, especially on shipping, by buying the individual books on abe.com.\n\nAlso on abe.com is one listing for the boxed set, but it is $350.00. If you contact the bookseller and point out that the retail price is only $300.00 new they might match it, and you might save on shipping.\n\nOn both sites I used the keyword search term \"Doyald Young\". FWIW, I think the site you mentioned is legitimate.\n\nHTH\n\n"
