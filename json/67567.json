  "content": "I understand the usage of the tilde character for various glyphs. What I don't understand is why the asciitilde and the tilde are two different sizes. What is the point? Is there some usage for the asciitilde that is not already covered by the tilde? Sign painters sometimes use the asciitilde as a hyphen, but somehow I don't think that is it's intended usage.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n[[http://www.thefontry.com/|_from the Fontry_\n\n",

It is sized and positioned to sit above alphabet characters.  \nThe ascii tilde sits centered on a line in a position aligning with math symbols like the equals sign. It is sized to match well with figures. It is used as others have said, in coding and as a symbol, (perhaps in linguistics?).\n\n"

(You probably have to be a programmer to appreciate the difference.)\n\n"
