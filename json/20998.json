The sign industry has little if any glamour to attract lots of talented people. Good paying sign design jobs are rare. If we really care about the visually electric nature of our commercial streets we should be willing to invest more in them.\n\nThere is a small minority of talented artists doing very good quality work in the sign industry. They know \"storefront personality\" matters. They know the responsibility they have in their work, knowing if they sluff off uninspired dreck they'll be reminded of it everytime they drive past it, possibly for many years to come. At the same time they must fight from growing disillusioned by all the poor quality sign work they see others doing.\n\nToday, most sign designers have no formal training, no art degree and are often terribly lacking in talent. But there are legions of such people who are willing to work for little pay. To most of them, it's just a job until they get something better -probably something not even art related. Since most business people still believe computers and software are creating the artwork they feel there is no need to pay extra for someone armed with an art degree and competent portfolio of work.\n\n"
