If you look at the [gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20101024061722/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/gallery/) at Letterheard fonts you'll many samples. Perhaps people at first tried using different pointsizes to mimic the gradation but realized that it wasn't working and so simply decided to use to caps on either end. Maybe?\n\n"

(especially when it is in large signage or poster format that everyone must see) or better yet why is it accepted practice by designers. both are easily asnwered questions i guess, but ya know we have to have something to complain about here every now and then :)\n\nw|m\n\n"

      "content": "I think burried within all of our comments is a chief reason why many current designers lack sensitivity on typographic balance.\n\nMany of us might recall the great debates about typography that ensued in the '90s during the transition from high-end proprietary digital typesetters to open-ended PostScript imagesetters.\n\nUp until that point, whenever you required type, you generally marked up the copy and sent it to a type house. Getting typeset copy and composed headlines was not cheap! Therefore, any designer that didn't comprehend type spec-ing (sp?) caused unnecessary expense and needless delays.\n\nAlso, many professional typesetters would tweak photo headlines and galley type output in spite of poor markup (especially if it was a good client). The sins of the graphic designers were often corrected by typographers.\n\nOnce the front-end PostScript devices were put into the hands of graphic designers and copy writers, the need for professional typographers and typesetters went the way of the town blacksmith.\n\nWe often argued that most graphic designers had broader training and that typography was highly specialized. But as frequently happens, tight budgets prevail.\n\nOne of the main reasons why I left the type industry and moved on to multimedia and Internet publishing was that the market was dwindling for dinosaurs such as myself.\n\nI'm happy to see that many members of Typophile strive to maintain the craft and art of typography.\n\n------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I'm back in style!\n\n"
