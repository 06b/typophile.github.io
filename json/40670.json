  "content": "This question might rub a few of you wrong, but if you have an answer please share.\n\nI'm trying to add a drop shadow to an object in InDesign CS3. (Object\\>Effects\\>Drop Shadow), I know this much. The object is a vector graphic imported from Illustrator. I'm curious if I can change the resolution of the drop shadow, much like you can in Illustrator (hence the Document Raster Effect Setting reference in the title). Currently when viewing the design at high quality, the drop shadow looks very bitmapped. I'd like to change the resolution if I can, but I don't know where to start.\n\nAny help will be appreciated. However, please refrain from sharing your opinions for or against the use of drop shadows, they will not be appreciated.\n\n",
