Your poor users won't be able to select italic the usual way, only with using software that support stylistic sets. Changing some text containing italics in another font to yours won't change the italics to yours. And the italics variant will not show up in any font menu.\n\n"

So you would need to offer the same behavior in an 'ssXX' feature too, at least.  \nI consider it as a convenient way for fonts whose italic lowercase are accompanied by upright uppercase, and have used it for both Litteratra and the OpenType version of df Rialto.  \nSince not all applications support OpenType layout tables, it makes sense to provide a separate italic font too ...\n\n"

It enables one to build an East Asian font with a relatively small Latin subset, for e.g. Japanese Romaji, without needing to duplicate the entire Asian glyph set in multiple fonts for different styles of Latin letters. The 'ital' feature is, I believe, supported in the Asian versions of Adobe applications.\n\nI would say this feature is not only East Asian-specific but also CFF-specific. It solves a problem that, in TrueType, would be solved by making a TrueType Collection (TTC) font.\n\n"
