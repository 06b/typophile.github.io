  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI am a final year student at Nottingham Trent University, desperate for some primary research for my dissertation on typography.  \nI was wondering if anyone could offer their opinion on any of the following questions...\n\nIs typography a craft?  \nHas the quality of type design been affected by digitization?  \nAre all new typefaces just an imitation of existing designs or is it still possible to achieve original type design?  \nHas the internet become saturated with poor quality type design?  \nIs it possible to avoid?  \nWhat defines good typography?\n\nAny help or comments you may give will be extremely helpful and much appreciated.  \nThank you,  \nSophie Metcalfe\n\n",
