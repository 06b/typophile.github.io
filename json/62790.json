  "content": "I've been spending the last few days trying to decide on a font for a company I am starting. It's an apparel company where we focus our focus is simple and elegant experiences. Right now the logo I've designed is very simple so I need a typeface that goes along with it. I want it to be simple and elegant. By that I mean simple but looks really good. It must be both, the elegant fonts are not going to do and simple to is too broad.\n\nI really liked Avenir but a friend of mine whose opinion I trust turned it down quickly. He said I would like Chalet, which I do but I was wondering if any of you have any other suggestions?\n\n",

Maybe also check out Whitney or Verlag by [H&FJ](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102022626/http:/typography.com/)\n\nThe Chalet family has a lot of different styles ranging from Bauhaus to Helvetica-esque. I'd just try to avoid Chalet London 1980. I think it ends up looking cheesy most of the time (especially if you use a lowercase t).\n\nI think [Neutraface](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102022626/http:/www.christianschwartz.com/neutra.shtml) is a very elegant looking sans serif. It's often times used to look a little Art Deco if that's appealing to you.\n\nJust out of curiosity, what was wrong with Avenir?\n\n———————————————————-  \n [Read Between the Leading podcast](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102022626/http:/rbtl.us/) | [Pixelspread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102022626/http:/pixelspread.com/)\n\n"

Interesting fact: both were designed to mimic the characteristics of famous architects handwriting and/or lettering (Richard Neutra and Frank Lloyd Wright).\n\n———————————————————-  \n [Read Between the Leading podcast](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102022626/http:/rbtl.us/) | [Pixelspread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102022626/http:/pixelspread.com/)\n\n"

      "content": "Hi rhyde,  \nIt seems you have an aesthetic in mind. When I'm at that point, I tend to do some freehand sketching in place of the font. I get a few scenarios to work with so I can see the graphic & imagery as a whole. At that point, I look for something that can be applied to what came naturally.\n\nIf all your work is currently on the screen, output your graphics and try sketching on overlays to determine good positioning & weight.\n\nMike Lee | ReadyType™\n\n"
