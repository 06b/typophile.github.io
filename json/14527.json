Now I feel I should do so.\n\nI did an identity a while ago for one of my customers for a cobranding initiative \"canon professional center\" - a sort of one stop print shop featuring exclusively canon equipment. As I exchanged mails with canon brand manager for Romania, I mention what had been on my mind for a while at the time, the typeface issue. The answer I got at the time was that they were using a \"customised\" typeface, however loose that answer might have been.\n\nThe samples provided as reference are way too small to be of any efficient help, but if you check any of the [downloadable PDF brochures](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009103056/http:/www.brochures.canon-europe.com/getFile.php?productid=8071&languageid=1) they provide on the site, you'll get a mention of the contained typefaces, and the only one who stands out is \"DendaNew\". The italics are awfully close to those of JFPorchez's LeMonde Sans Italic, and the upright versions have a feel of Formata and Stella, but if I were to guess, judging by the overall look and feel, I would credit either Mario Feliciano (Stella) or Michael Abbink (Kievit) with the typeface, with a slight prefference for the latter, given his involvment in identity programmes.\n\n"
