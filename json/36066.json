  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI've looked through the FL manual but can't find anything mentioning a autotrace feature, but I was sure that FL had one, am I wrong\n\nI bought a copy of FL's Scan font but I've never been able to get it work. I click the ScanFont icon then click the install button and then accept the license agreement, but then I always get an error window saying - \"Installation interrupted - can't create destination folders' tree\". I tried contacting FL about this matter but never got a proper response. I'm using a Mac OSX 10.3.9.\n\nIf anyone could help with the Scan font problem then I wouldn't need a autotrace in FL and that would be great.\n\nRr.\n\n",

Then I used Tools \\> Background \\> Trace. The results were less than spectacular.\n\nUnder Tools \\> Options \\> Trace Options I made some adjustments and got much better results as far as following the contour. Unfortunately, there were way too many points, and the cleanup was too time consuming.\n\nI didn't spend much time on it, so there is probably a way to tweak it to get even better results, but drawing it manually seems like the best way to ensure a quality result.\n\n"

      "content": "You may find BitFonter 3 (which is a sort of ScanFont on steroids) giving the best results when it comes to autotracing. I agree that the tracing in FontLab Studio may be suboptimal. One trick is to convert your image to black-and-white and try different pixel sizes. In FontLab Studio, more does not always mean better. The autotracing of an image that is 800 pixels high may give you better results than of one that is 3000 pixels high.\n\nAdam\n\n"
