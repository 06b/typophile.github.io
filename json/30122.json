  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've just updated an old logo for a project I'm in.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019020500im_/http:/typophile.com/files/zap_logo_2_5568.png)\n\nThe aim of the project is to provide free wireless access in Québec city.\n\nThe look I'm aiming at is a mix between 40's illustration style and web 2.0, so something humanist with a modernist twist, or the other way around. Actually the less the modulation, the better I guess, but I still want some. ;)\n\nThe type in the logo is handmade, and I'm looking for a font to go with it.  \nSo far there are my choices after a bit of research:\n\n• ITC Johnston --- Like it but unsure.  \n• URW Grotesk --- Dinka like this one too but I just dislike the \"a\" and I'm not sure it would read well.  \n• FF Din --- It starts being a bit far from the logo but it would be interesting to use it.\n\nSo far my favourite is Johnston.\n\nIf you have any ideas, go for it.\n\n",

      "content": "Johnston is a little more friendly than Grotesk, so I'd pick that one of the two. It also feels a little more municipal, it seems like something I'd see on buses or subway trains. FF Din is cool, but it don't get either 40s or Web 2.0 out of it, so I don't think it fits with your design scheme.\n\n"
