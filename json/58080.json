Today even though I had this unchecked it would still allow my cursor to select metrics. I expanded the panel and hit the lock on horizontal metrics and that stopped auto selecting. Then I tried the same with vertical metrics, but it still allows auto selecting even when locked. Is there a fix for this or am I dealing with a bug in the program?\n\n",

It was helpful in some ways because I had never made so that it required a key command to select the background before. That makes my work much easier not having to double click it back off all the time. I'm so used to using a wacom tablet which is way over-sensitive for FontLab.\n\nStephen\n\n"
