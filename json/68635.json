However, it was too much of a temptation to design a hairline variant, and this exploration gave the family’s lighter weights an elegant, graceful feel. The script was modified further to use connected letterforms as the primary glyphs. With its unique swirled ball terminals, this versatile script draws immediate attention. The face glides and flows across the page and the swirling ball terminals provide an interesting diversion to the flow. The lighter weights have an almost spencerian look.  \nSildetas includes six weights and is a very unique script face. Lighter weights can be used for elegant invitiations. Sildetas can get the job done for many unique design tasks.\n\nSildetas includes many useful OpenType features, including a set of non-connecting and titling alternates, ligatures, and two types of end swashes. Opentype features include simplified swashed stylistic alternates without ball terminals, swash endings, ending contextual alternates, discretionary ligatures, ligatures and five different stylistic sets filled with alternates. In total, there are over 60 alternate letterforms.\n\nOpenType-capable applications such as Quark or the Adobe suite can take full advantage of the automatically replacing ligatures and alternates. This family also includes the glyphs to support a wide range of languages.\n\n[Sildetas is 33% off for a limited time!](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104063056/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sildetas/)\n\n",
