  "content": "Hi there, i'm researching the style of a particular lettering style of a Maori prophet (in New Zealand, obviously). The lettering stlye seems to be of some european inspiration... celtic, maybe? It looks quite familiar, but I can't quite pick it. It is quite inconsistent, but I recognise some character designs, and would appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction for other source material.\n\nRegards,\n\n- Chris\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415103210/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_2.pdf) | 175 KB |\n\n",
