It's nice, but like Stephen says, it's murder on your hands after a few punches.\n\nSeriously, if you have a lot of corners to round, hit up the printers, they'll either have a slab press that have a corner rounder thing on it, or they might have a small appliance that's operated by foot pressure and they'll probably let you do the work.\n\n"
