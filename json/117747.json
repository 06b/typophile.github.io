  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m trying to figure out what some typefaces are related to two different images from the inside of Playbills:\n\nIn the first attachment, I’d like to know what typefaces are used for “PRESENT” and “AUDRA MCDONALD” or “BY” and “LANIE ROBERTSON.” “PRESENT” and “BY” look a a little like Sweet Sans, but don’t think that’s it. I don’t know what’s used for “AUDRA MCDONALD” or “LANIE ROBERTSON.”\n\nIn the second attachment, it would be great to know what typeface is used for “ACT II,” as well as the info below it related to the the Scenes, Scene Names, Characters, etc. They all look to be the same typeface (bold and roman being the only difference) and I think are standard across most Playbills but don’t know what they are.\n\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Lady-Day-at-Emersons-Bar-and-Grill-Apr-13-14-1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901231335/http:/typophile.com/files/Lady-Day-at-Emersons-Bar-and-Grill-Apr-13-14-1.jpg) | 163.91 KB |\n| [acs-scenes-2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901231335/http:/typophile.com/files/acs-scenes-2.jpg) | 1.06 MB |\n\n",
