It is a recent photograph of a sign that was created close to 30 years ago. The \"R\" is rather unique, but I can't seem to find a typeface that matches. Caslon and Jenson are close, but not quite right.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nBill\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Revival 565 \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114456/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

I converted the image to grayscale, upped the contrast, then inverted it to make the letters easier to read. I'm thinking it's not a standard print typeface, but something the sign makers had in their repertoire.\n\nRevival 565 looks pretty darn close (though not quite).
