Sovba is useful for a look that is uniquely casual, fresh and smooth. Sovba simplifies character forms down to their basic characteristics, and has a strong, silky smooth forward motion.\n\nSovba includes more traditional optional alternates for a number of characters, including the E and F, OpenType alternate characters, old style figures and small caps. Sovba is a fine choice when you require a versatile upright oblique for logotypes, headlines or short blocks of text.
