  "content": "Greetings from late-night design questions,\n\nI'm just curious to find out how the Featured Faces (Displayed in the forum topic titles for instance) are displayed, or embedded(?) I'm in the beginning stages of redesigning my own site, and am looking to explore some new possibilities.\n\nI've discovered some proprietary solutions for Internet Explorer as well as some others, but I'd really like to replicate the quality of the display as shown here at Typophile. How is it done? Are there any computability issues across browsers?\n\nAny direct help in terms of coding programs or links to useful material would be greatly appreciated.\n\nbest,  \nBrock\n\n",
