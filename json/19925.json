  "content": "Okay, potentially stupid question: Does anyone know the history of the use of the baseline grid? Is it something that has been in use throughout the history of typography, or just something that was popularized by programs like Quark and InDesign, which make its implementation easy? I’ve read numerous books on typography, design, and their related histories, and none of them make any mention of baseline grid at all. Google only seems to turn up tutorials for page layout software.\n\nIf anyone could enlighten me or point me in the direction of enlightenment, I’d be very grateful.\n\n",
