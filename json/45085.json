Letters speak, and if you remove them from the constraints of sentences and even words, they  \nhave a language of their own.\n\nMyType uses the craft of typography to find new ways of speaking  \nusing fonts famous and unknown including Helvetica, Avant Garde and  \ntypotherapy creations like Tomeri and VWmobile.\n\nFor more information visit: [www.keep6c.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123102806/http:/www.keep6c.com/ \"www.keep6c.com\") and [www.toronto.ca/fad](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123102806/http:/www.toronto.ca/fad \"www.toronto.ca/fad\")  \nFor more new modernist design genius, visit: [www.typotherapy.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123102806/http:/www.typotherapy.com/ \"www.typotherapy.com\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MyType-1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123102806/http:/typophile.com/files/MyType-1.jpg) | 117.02 KB |\n\n",
