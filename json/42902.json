I am finishing the font and have noticed that there are lots of yellow nodes, which indicate where I have two points on top of each other. (see image)\n\nMy question is how do I get rid of these double points?\n\nIs there an automated way of doing it, as there are lots throughout the entire font?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [double points.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906210429/http:/typophile.com/files/double%20points.jpg) | 88.44 KB |\n\n [‹ font syncing](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906210429/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42923 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Kerning Missing From Truetype Using Fontlab 5.0 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906210429/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42382 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
