This is why this site humbles me.\n\nBut, the example is from Bon Magazine, so the problem is I wouldn't expect them to squoosh fonts, unless it's a custom made squooshing they've ordered. Here are also a few more examples where I think at least 'j', 'c' and 'y' are different to Franklin?\n\nThe font is also used throughout their website [www.bonmagazine.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224080657/http:/www.bonmagazine.com/ \"www.bonmagazine.com\").\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224080657im_/http:/typophile.com/files/justice_5735.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224080657im_/http:/typophile.com/files/handsome_5255.jpg)\n\n"

So I surprised myself when I realised that it was the first thing I stumbled upon - embarrasingly not recognising the cut. Maybe unconsciously I am not yet ready to give up on Franklin, it has served me well.\n\nBut, the remaining problem is that on the text setting Franklin seems too rigid to me now.
