Henning, Paul Melzer. Lots of interesting writing (and some illustrations using the writing techniques/drills) by people that had more patience than I could ever have... they tell how young Platt Spencer saved and saved for one sheet of paper and up until that day he had been practicing his writing on bark! It's out of print but worth checking out if your library has it or you find it at a good price.\n\n"
