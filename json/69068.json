  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am trying to decide on a typeface for a 8x8 inch publication. It is still very much a work in progress, and is intended to copy Aspen Magazine - the Minimalism Issue, 1969. I have attached two images of it.\n\nI chose to go with Franklin Gothic: Franklin Gothic Condensed medium for headings, and Franklin Gothic Book for the bread. I usually try to match sans serifs with serifs, but want to this time get as close to the original as I can. I also tried a version where I had Franklin Gothic Condensed for bread and heading. Attaching images of both. Is it too boring?\n\nPlease let me know if I am on the wrong path! Thank you!\n\nSara\n\n",
