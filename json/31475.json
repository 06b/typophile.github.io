The Renaissance is a wonderfully clear face, with character, but not too much. Aldus has a lovely hand woven feel to it. And Weiss is such a deco beaut, but again, very clear and unfussy.\n\nAny thoughts as to why we seem them so rarely??\n\nJohn\n\n",

AND it has a different name, so its readiness may not always be apparent, AND it was never mass-bundled, unlike Palatino itself.\n\n(…AND their is no \"Aldus Sans\"…)\n\n"

I agree with the other respondents here that Aldus and Zapf Renaissance were simply outshone or out-marketed (depending on your degree of cynicism) by the rest of the man's prodigious output. And Aldus may be underrated, but that 'one weight only' thing does get in the way.\n\nWeiss may be unfussy, and may be quite like [Bernhard Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014013625/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/atf/bernhard-modern/familytree.html) in terms of its elegant proportion, but I recall using it as a business report text face and it appears very pale – a bit spidery really, on the page.\n\n"

I believe I dropped $300 or so on it back in 1996 or thereabouts. I bought it from Fonthaus, who was distributing it for Scangraphic. I think Scangraphic's collection was later absorbed by E+F or Linotype.\n\nIt could use an overhaul. There were some metrics and kerning problems with the version I bought.\n\nThe complaint about the absence of a [bold verison of Aldus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014013625/http:/www.linotype.com/109964/aldusnovabookbold-font.html) and [its corresponding italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014013625/http:/www.linotype.com/109961/aldusnovabookitalic-font.html) is now answered with the Aldus Nova release, but for now it's only available as part of the large Palatino Nova package bundle. Sadly it will be a while before I have the $999 to spend just to get to those two new weights. Palatino Nova is also missing Palatino Heavy, which I was always fond of. I also miss the look of the foundry versions and the alternate extenders, and the original Palatino Italic swashes. Seeing those is still a rare treat.\n\n"
