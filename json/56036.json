  "content": "Hello all,  \nI am tasked with designing a logo for a bicyclist outreach campaign for a non-profit in New York City. The targeted audience is both seasoned cyclists and those contemplating shifting modes to cycling as a form of commuting.\n\nIt shouldn’t be too esoteric (ie. not using bike parts that only real bike fanatics will be able to read).\n\nUltimately, the goal of the campaign is to highlight both safe cycling as well as the upside of biking.\n\nThe logo should be friendly, inviting and slightly playful.\n\nWe’ve been though a million iterations and the consensus has been to follow in the direction attached below. If anyone has any suggestions for further font, color or layout directions, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sketches.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203911/http:/typophile.com/files/sketches.jpg) | 194.69 KB |\n\n [‹ Can anyone tell me about this logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203911/http:/typophile.com/node/56253 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Blu loyalty card ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406203911/http:/typophile.com/node/56120 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I agree with both other postings. You have accomplished exactly what you didn’t want to do. While your design is stylistically attractive, it looks geared for the extreme mountain biker, not a seasoned NYC cyclist nor someone new to biking as an alternative means of transportation. It does not say “safe cycling”. Step back from it for a little bit and look at it with fresh eyes. I understand you’ve been through tons of versions already but ask yourself the question Does this logo really say what we want it to say, or does it just look cool?\n\n"

      "content": "It seems to me your target market - those most likely to consider cycling to work - are the environmental greenies. You know, the type that believes if we all rode bikes instead of cars, it would bring about world peace AND bring John Lennon back to life? To that end, if I were you, I’d go walk through Whole Foods and look at logos. This logo is more grungy dirt biker than enlightened urban hippie.\n\nOf course I could be characterizing your target market entirely wrong?\n\nAlso, at first glance, the ring immediately evoked a steering wheel on a sports car; and, don’t tell anyone, but I consider myself and enlightened urban hippie...\n\nOne more idea; have you considered an “alternative to a taxi” concept? Perhaps a campaign built around why bikes are better than taxis?\n\n"

You could simply work on making this concept look more “enlightened urban hippie” than “grungy dirt biker” as Alaskan put it. Changing the texture and the colours could give it a completely different feel.\n\n"
