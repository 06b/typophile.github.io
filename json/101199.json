      "content": "> Now just got find $175 :( Thats expensive!!\n\nThat's really depends on what you need exactly. If this is for commercial project and you definitely believe it is the perfect one, it's worth $175. But I understand if you only need one weight, it's a shame to have to pay for the all package (same problem with Hoefler and Frere Jones fonts). I don't know if it could work but you could try to ask gently to House Industries to sell you the weight(s) you need. You could also try to convince your client this is the One and to buy it for the project.\n\n> Don't suppose anyone has an alternative. Mmmm\n\nChalet is very close to Helvetica so if you have time and skills, you could try to customize it to fit your needs. You could for instance start from [Helvetica Textbook](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016063225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/helveticatextbook-roman) or [FF Schulbuch](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016063225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-schulbuch) to get a single storey /a. But still a lot of work on /t, /y... There's also [Coolvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016063225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/coolvetica) and some freebies like [Clemente](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016063225/http:/www.dafont.com/clemente-pd.font), [Lane](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016063225/http:/www.dafont.com/lane.font) or [Walkway](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016063225/http:/www.dafont.com/walkway.font). But they could never be considered as substitutes. They're simply \"close to Helvetica\" as Chalet.\n\n"
