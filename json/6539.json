  "content": "\\<font class=\"dontLookLikeCrap\"\\>I really could use some help -- I'm having problems with a font I bought earlier today, and I've run out of ideas.   \n   \nThe font is [Wade Vernacular](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110142142/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/aboutype/wade-vernacular/). It comes as a set of four versions (solid, shadowed, shaded, outline). I bought it as Windows TT, even though what I really needed it for was a project I'm doing on my Mac (the fabled zine), because Win TT is supposed to work under OSX, and I haven't had any problems doing that in the past, and I wanted to be able to use it on my Windows computer (e.g. it has a better printer).   \n   \nThree of the four versions are working just fine (solid, shadowed, shaded). The fourth, Wade V. Outline, is doing some really bizarre stuff in my Adobe programs. It works fine in everything except InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. This is what it looks like:   \n ![Outline big](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110142142im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48254.gif)   \nThis is what is should look like:   \n ![Outline textedit](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110142142im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48255.gif)   \nFor comparison, the other versions, which look fine:   \n ![Solidshaded](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110142142im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48256.gif)   \n   \nEven more bizarre than the first image shows, the distortions change as you change the point size. For example:   \n ![Hs](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110142142im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48257.gif)   \n   \nI've tried resinstalling, converting the problem font from Win TT to Mac TT with a Mac program (TTConverter), with a PC program (CrossFont), and rebooting, with no luck. And this version (outline) was most of the reason I bought this font instead of some other slab serif.   \n   \nAnyone seen anything like this before?\\</font\\>\n\n",

I think I just assumed, really for no reason, that they'd be meanies and say \"That's what you get for buying the wrong format.\"   \n   \nThomas, I tried it in Word (v. X) and it's doing the same thing there. So if it's a bug, it probably isn't an Adobe-specific one. And I also just discovered that the distortion doesn't show up in PDFs exported from Indy. Go figure.   \n   \nThanks for the suggestion Stephen, sorry if I seemed a little panic-stricken everyone ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110142142im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "The designer was kind enough to send me a copy of the font, and I couldn't find anything wrong with it (other than the exclamation mark being in the slot for the space character, but that's another issue). Path winding order looks good. There are a few unnecessary control points, but nothing terrifying.   \n   \nMy best guess is that FontLab's TT auto-hinting is messing things up a bit. I would hardly even blame it; an outline this complex is \\*really\\* poorly suited to TT auto-hinting. But who'd want to manually hint something like this, either? If I needed a TT version, I'd be tempted to leave it completely unhinted. But that's just me.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
