  "content": "Article about \"Euroface\" at Mr. Bil'ak's site:   \n   \n\"The research included continuing reevaluation of existing   \ntype designs (Helvetica, DIN Schriften, Universe etc.) The   \nresults are revealing. For instance: Helvetica failed in all the   \nlaboratory tests, obtaining only 0.4 ISRU. Consequently, the   \nEuropean Committee for Uniformity of Type Design and   \nType Safety decided to abolish Helvetica for the 21 century   \nas absolutely non-functional and dangerous for the new   \n generation. As we have emphasised, this total systems   \nviewpoint is necessary in order to avoid proliferating design   \nwhich, whilst independently effective for regional problems,   \nconflict with the current overall system.\"   \n   \n [http://www.typotheque.com/articles/euroface.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825175554/http:/www.typotheque.com/articles/euroface.html)   \n   \nhehehe. Helvetica is dangerous for the new generation!\n\n",
