But i’ll answer you questions a well as i can. most of them seem to be pdf and prepress related  \nType area: This is may be defined as a safe area for type thats inside your trim. Have seen it before but can’t remember where/when.  \nPrint Marks: Dunno  \nInk Weight: This means that you artwork has more than the total allowable ink on certain parts of an image. ie 100C 80M 90Y 60K, this can cause problems on the press. You need to do your RGB to CMYK conversion using the correct profile in photoshop.  \nKnock Out (overprint): are you preflighting you files before putting them into quickcut? some pdf preflight software will automatically set black to overprint. might want to also try some different ways to output your pdf. Generally the best method is to print to ps and then distill.\n\n"
