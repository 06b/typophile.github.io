  "content": "INTRODUCTION   \n   \nVan is a Sans-Serif typography with a geometric style.   \nThis version is expanded and don´t have contrast between the   \ndifferent types of strokes, giving a uniform esthetic and visual in   \neach character, word or a column of text.   \nThe family of van typography that is constitued by two different   \nwidth: normal and condensed wich one have the versions: Ultra Light, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold and all the respectives italics versions. I designed and plannificated this   \ntypography to use as text and display but I think that they must be   \ncorrected to use as font screen because some caracters have more   \nvisual impact that others like for exemple LC-V, E, M, Z and SC-a, y.   \nFigures 5, 6, 9. All the critics are welcome to corrected and fininshed the work.GIF / JPG:   \n ![Text Description](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414160929im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/236.jpg)\n\n",

The only glyph that I didn't like was the lc \"g\": although the open-bottom bicameral \"g\" is my favorite form of that letter, I think the head needs to be bigger, to match the style of the lc \"a\" and lc \"e\", for example.   \n   \nKeep it up,   \nHrant\n\n"

      "content": "Van seems to be coming along nicely. It has some nice nuances. I'm liking the condensed regular italic a lot.   \n   \nThe particulars of the face aside, however, I've been thinking about some advice I once heard that might be useful--depending on how complete your font is I guess.   \n   \nThe gist of the advice was that it's best not to pursue multiple weights of a face until you have the main weight completed and polished. And only when it's complete would you translate it to other weights or widths (bold, light, condensed, etc.)   \n   \nI'm curious. Would others agree with this advice in general? Would you agree in the case of Ricardo's Van? If you were planning a font with lots of weights and/or widths, would you start with the regular weight?   \n   \n//joe\n\n"

      "content": "Joe,   \n   \nIn general, yes because it's a pain to fix multiple faces if you decide after the fact to make changes. Shouldn't the purpose of the typefaces dictate their development? For instance if you're designing a display face with a corresponding text version, doesn't it make sense to not go too far with either one before working on the other?\n\n"

      "content": "In fact you are totally correct, in this moment it's the way that i prefer to work starting by regular and italic versions to create the others weights (form/space). But Van was a special case, I had to draw all weights because the limits of the letters round - like I show in this last exemple.   \nIf I created the other weight from the regular version using Fontographer, all that round properties would be destroyed with the transformation, so I prefered to make myself all.   \nDid you notice any strange differnces between the weights?   \nThank's for attention Joe / Hrant / Objeckt   \n   \nBest Regards\\_Ricardo   \nGIF / JPG:   \n ![1,Text Description](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414160929im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif)\n\n"
