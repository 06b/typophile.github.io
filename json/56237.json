Is there anything I don't see? (I see the crap kerning.) I'm particularly interested in opinions on how I've handled the nonLatin alphabets. I know there is something inherently perverse about making Greek into a biform unicase, but Cyrillic takes to it quite naturally, and I hope it's as successful as I, an anglophone, think it is. Are there any unacceptable transgressions? And, if you hope to use this font yourself, no matter where you are, are there any characters you would expect to use that are conspicuous in their absence?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cerulea09.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044534/http:/typophile.com/files/cerulea09_0.pdf) | 394.55 KB |\n| [cerulea10.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044534/http:/typophile.com/files/cerulea10_0.pdf) | 394.52 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Yes, I've heard of fonts having several thousand kerning pairs, I think...  \nThis is pretty neat. I like the quirky way you have serifs blended with cut-off terminals (like on the G or between the S and T for instance). I love the caps especially. There's a kind of uncial feel going on in there too, which is surprising considering the sharp edges. The AKMWY are my favourites. I find the lowercase letters less successful and the curves look less polished. I find 2 unbalanced (always my hardest glyph by far!) and the regular e somehow distorted up close. I think £ could have a lower crossbar like the F? There's something wrong with the bottom curve of a in the bold and black, where it retroflexes back down to join the stem.  \nYour italic ampersand is fascinating. Bold and black somehow look better to me than the regular, not sure why. Can't say anything about the nonlatin glyphs I'm afraid.\n\n"

      "content": "Nice work, seems like the Cyrillic/Greek really outshines the other letters for sure. The latin characters \"e\" and the R's could use a bit more work but the rest are pretty consistent.\n\nAs far as the kerning issues, normally if I have kerning issues, the font is not spaced properly. Spacing is 99% of making a font look good also. Kerning really cements the fine details but if you are having to kern one letter a lot more than the others, its probably a spacing issue.\n\n"

It looks really elegant.  \nI love the italic variable, it is so fluid over text.  \nI think the minuscule \"a\" of the regular latin version is a bit overweighted, but just a bit, it may be because of its top part which is a bit thicker than I think it should be.  \nThis is my opinion, only my opinion.  \nI strong believe that your font is superb, so keep it up!  \nBest,  \nMaximiliano R.

      "content": "Thanks very much; I've made adjustments benefiting from just about all of your comments, plus some others from my friends (the s was lacking overshoot, for instance). See the new pdf.\n\nThe missing pairs were caused by putting multiple alphabets all into the same kerning classes. I've separated the classes out, but I still need to sort them into their language categories.\n\nCan you help me decide: The crossbar of the regular Latin capital A is really low, originally owing to the face's concept of big spacious counters wherever possible. I raised the crossbar some in its Greek and Cyrillic equivalents lest they be too easily confused with Δ and Д. Should I also change the Latin A to match, or is it okay that way?\n\n"
