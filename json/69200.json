I tried Indent-i-Font and the other three or four automated sites and they couldn't nail it either.\n\nThoughts? Thanks!\n\nGary\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Colonial Text.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100415211900/http:/typophile.com/files/Colonial%20Text_0.jpg) | 37.98 KB |\n\n",
