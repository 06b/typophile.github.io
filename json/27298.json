      "content": "_“Ooooooooh, nice one , Mike! Brilliant ID.”_\n\nThanks, Yves, but it was really solved by a tool. All I did was use the a, b, and e in the [Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013084241/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php) and pick it out of a visual lineup of 28 fonts that had those features. It’s my ’secret weapon’ for Serif fonts. It’s a bit tricky to use, because the 12 key letters are not always easy to match with the choices, but it often gets you into the right styles if you don’t try to use the ’shaky’ letter choices.\n\nMaybe you think using a Tool takes the challenge out of the ID process, but I think our goal is to make the ID first. (Besides using this tool can be a challenge too.)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I’ve always been the first to say that all’s fair in war and love when it comes down to nailing an ID. We are dedicated to providing a positive identification as fast as possible, not to being gloryhounds or ego-strokers. Furthermore I use the same method when looking up stuff in Rookledge’s. ;^)\n\n"
