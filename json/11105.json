I do happen to have a fetish for designs that combine the mechanical and the organic, but Oban (great name, btw) really is class.   \n   \nStephen's suggestion for the numeral \"4\" is right on, but for the UC \"M\" I think it needs more than just a lower middle: it needs a curvier middle. Also: the \"K\" is imbalanced, the \"Q\" is amazing, the \"X\" too wide.   \n   \nIn the lc, \"k\" and \"x\" have the same problems as above, but overall I'm salivating to see some text.   \n   \nNon-alphanumerics: The exclamation/question color needs help, the dollar sign is the only one with a double bar that I've ever liked, the ampersand rocks, the BP is too stiff, the Pilcrow is great, the Euro looks forced.   \n   \nMore, please!!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The whole alphabet is very exciting and has enormous potential.   \n   \nThe lower leg of the K seems a bit thin, and the round corners of the Z seem inconsistent with the way you've handled similar junctions.   \n   \nAs for the punctuation, the letterforms seem close - I think I'd need to see the punctuation in context to judge their compatibility.\n\n"

It's hard to believe you're   \njust starting out in type design when you have   \nsuch a great grasp of form and consistency.   \n  \nI like the base shape, the rounded corners and   \nthe angled terminals. I'm sure this face will   \nlend itself well to a bold weight too.   \n  \nTwo small concerns:   \n  \n- The 'M' distracted me immediately. I'd like to   \nsee the middle come down a bit to match the   \nother caps.   \n  \n- The '4's counter is much smaller than any other   \nglyph. Maybe an open topped '4' is in order.   \n  \nIt's very cool overall and there is certainly   \na market for this look. Peter Bruhn of Fountain   \nmight be watching this critique closely. See his   \n [latest](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414194630/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/mayo.asp).   \n  \nStephen\n\n"
