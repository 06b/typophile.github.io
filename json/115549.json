The other one is not a text face like this one, and it might not be entirely original, but to me it looks closer to something people would want to use.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "My main impression is a certain inconsistency in weight distribution: The thin parts of letters don't have the same optical thinness from one letter to the next; the same is true of the thick parts; serifs and terminals vary in size and weight from one letter to the next; that sort of thing. Up close, there are also some issues with detailing (rare but exaggerated ink traps, coarse curves) and proportions (e.g., the /c is too wide compared with the /e).\n\nDon't despair: This reminds me a lot of my first typeface on Typophile... it was an attempt at a text face, too, and it had much more serious problems than yours. Like you, I had a second project for a modern-style display face going. People recommended I concentrate on display fonts for a while, and that was very helpful. Display fonts are less harsh in terms of requirements and they have more room for \"quirkiness\", so they're a good place to refine one's skills while still having fun and being productive. After more than a year of display faces, I am now back to my original text face, and it's going much better now. :) Hang in there!\n\n"
