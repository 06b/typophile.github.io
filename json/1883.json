  "content": "Breaking the Rules in Typography   \nCALL FOR ENTRIES   \n   \nDeadline: Aug. 16, 2002   \nEntry form: [http://www.howdesign.com/typographybook.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015021419/http:/www.howdesign.com/typographybook.pdf)   \n   \nAt last year's HOW Design Conference in San Francisco, type guru Allan Haley delivered a lively presentation titled \"Bombshell Typography: How the Best and Brightest Break the Rules.\" In it, he took basic cannons of typography and provided examples of how the rules were broken, not only successfully, but elegantly. As a result of the positive feedback from this presentation, HOW Design Books has asked Mr. Haley to enlarge it into an equally educational and inspirational book.   \n   \nThis is where you come in. We're looking for examples of great typographic design that breaks the rules. If you've designed something within the last year that breaks one or more of the rules of typography\n\n",
