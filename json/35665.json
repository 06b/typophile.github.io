      "content": "Here's a tip for identifying a font that you suspect is being SIFR'd onto the page. If you use FireFox with the adblock extension, click on the adblock button in your browser to load a list of all the adblock-able scripts, objects, and images in use on the page. (The idea is that you can use one to create a filter for excluding content originating from servers you don't like).\n\nWhen you use SIFR, it's common practice (though I don't think it's required) to name the Flash SWF file after the font it contains. So when you load the adblock list, look for a file ending in .swf with \"object\" category that has a font-like name. In this case, it's beorcana\\_titling\\_medium.swf.\n\nAlternatively, you can always view source and hunt for \".swf\".\n\nEDIT: Actually, just viewing source probably won't work since SIFR now pulls in the entire object/embed code via javascript. You'd have to \"view generated source\" or work your way through the DOM inspector.\n\nhth\n\n"
