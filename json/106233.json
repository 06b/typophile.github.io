The \"Brands of the World\" website has very little background info and states that the designer is unknown, but a scalable vector eps of the logo is downloadable from here:  \n [http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/gola-0](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115040452/http:/www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/gola-0 \"http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/gola-0\")\n\nAs for an actual font that it may be based on, the only idea I can come up with is - maybe have a look at Koloss and any similar typefaces, available @ [www.identifont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115040452/http:/www.identifont.com/ \"www.identifont.com\").\n\nAs a customer, maybe you could even contact Gola direct via:  \n [http://www.gola.co.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115040452/http:/www.gola.co.uk/ \"http://www.gola.co.uk/\")\n\n"

      "content": "Agree with Doghouse. Definitely custom (and not a good one in my opinion, /a looks terrible). Koloss might be a good choice for a customization. You might also consider [Bodoni Poster](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115040452/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/bodoni+poster). /G could be created with /O, right cutting and adding a crossbar to it. The rest is really easy. Keep /o, a vertical bar as /l and recreate from scratch /a (basic geometric shapes), just needs to keep /o counter shape.\n\n"
