It appears that embedding one of those typefaces into any document makes it subject to the GPL.\n\nSome of the comments were particularly interesting such as this one:\n\n`by dr.badass (25287) on Sunday April 17, @11:04PM (#12266364)\nI have to agree, the largest failing of Linux (and Java for that matter) is a good set of fonts. Why not make a bunch of truely Public Domain fonts so everyone can use them?`\n\n`There are plenty of public domain faces out on the web, but they're mostly of the novelty variety, and aren't really terribly relevant. Excepting them, here is why this hasn't happened yet:`\n\n`1) Good type design is pretty hard.\n2) Good type design for all-purpose screen fonts is really hard.\n3) Tools are either expensive or crap.\n4) Good type designers cost money.\n5) There just isn't much incentive.\n6) Open source community attitude toward design issues generally sucks.`\n\n`It's a good idea, but the people to convince are professional type designers and foundries. Bitstream Vera is a (the only?) example I can think of like this, though it's merely under \"generous copyright\".`\n\n",

      "content": "Fonts occupy a strange place between software and graphics; Misunderstanding about how they actually work is rampant. I offered a number of fonts that I'd designed (and packaged) to Debian five or six years ago -- I even offered to license them under the GPL, unmodified. The only thing that came of it was a heated discussion among the Debian developers over whether TTF or PFB files counted as source code or binary.\n\nThat said, the situation on Xorg has gotten much better lately, with the excellent rasterizing by [Pango](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415230118/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Pango)/XFT/Cairo (not sure exactly which one does the heavy lifting) under GTK. In my opinion, fonts render better on Xorg than in OSX or Windows. And a number of international fonts, in addition to the Bitstream Vera family, are included by default, at least under Debian and Ubuntu.\n\nThe [FontForge](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415230118/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontForge) home page lists a number of open-source font development projects: [http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/index.html#font-devel](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415230118/http:/fontforge.sourceforge.net/index.html#font-devel \"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/index.html#font-devel\")\n\n"
