A good trick is to angle the letters one way for the upper case and in the opposite direction for the lower case.  \nGenerate a couple of extra fonts with the letters at different sizes and a some variation in detail. For output, mix the fonts and cases, and you are about as close to informal lettering as you can get within the limits of digital font making.  \nDon \n"
