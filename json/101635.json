I can bring at the moment only 2 more similars: [Heroic Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025154509/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/heroic-condensed) and [Trump Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025154509/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic)  \nBTW, what's the sample origin? That could make the search easier...\n\n"
