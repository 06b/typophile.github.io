Kind of like enlarging something only meant to be viewed tiny only to find you like the details too. It really is original in so many ways, but you might also like [Eldorado Micro](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115073910/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/eldorado_micro/) for similar reasons. It isn't as stylized, but it has some of the exaggeration due to be designed to be used at small sizes.\n\n"

It has qualities that at first reminded me of kontrapunkt or cholla slab, but then the serifs added to its uniqueness in a very strange way. I have found fonts similar to kontrapunkt and cholla slab, but not Freight Micro.
