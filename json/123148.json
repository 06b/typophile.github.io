  "content": "The pics are of a piece of paper I used to do a rubbing over an engraved plaque on the front of our sailboat. I used a black crayon to rub over the letters. The boat was built in Taiwan in the 70's and I believe was delivered to England in 1976. The name of the boat is \"Seance\" and I think it was named and registered in England. So, I imagine these wooden plaques with the engraved name where made at that time. We have purchased 2 more sailboats and I'd like to have similar plaques made, using the same font but I can't figure out what it is. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks : )\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [image.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073416/http:/typophile.com/files/image_249.jpg) | 1.14 MB |\n| [image.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073416/http:/typophile.com/files/image_250.jpg) | 1.22 MB |\n| [image.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073416/http:/typophile.com/files/image_251.jpg) | 752.61 KB |\n\n",
