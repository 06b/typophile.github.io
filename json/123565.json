At the moment it's looking like I'm going to have to make a list of all of the humanist faces and then check which have the necessary glyph support -- not an especially appealing prospect!\n\nDoes anyone have a suggestion of a better way to carry out my search -- or possibly even firsthand knowledge of a suitable font?\n\n",
