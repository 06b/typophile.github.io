  "content": "Hi all,  \nI've been working on a new script font named dearJoe 5 and I am encountering a problem I've never seen before: After manually kerning the whole thing I am now testing the font (in Photoshop etc.) and I notice that in some letter combinations, when they overlap, the letters are not displayed correctly. Where the overlap is, the color is inverted: what should be black shows as white. When not overlapping all characters seem fine.  \nNow I could not find the solution myself and I hope it's something simple like a problem with the contours but really I couldn't tell.  \nSo my question is: what could cause this problem, how do I solve this and is there a way to check all characters at once for this error?\n\nThanks a lot for helping me out on this.\n\nAll the best,  \nJoe\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [dJ 5 overlap.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150403064335/http:/typophile.com/files/dJ%205%20overlap.jpg) | 31.62 KB |\n\n",
