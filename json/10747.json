  "content": "JH: _\\>I think we're too focused on whether the weight matches the letterpress, and not considering the more basic question: is the digital Electra too spindly to work as a text face in typical offset printing situations? . . . I've seen numerous books set in 11pt Electra that I would not want to read on account of the weakness of the type. . . . [T]his is something that can be judged soley with reference to the digital type as printed offset. Personally, if I intended to use Electra for anything printed offset, I would probably spend a couple of days beefing up the outlines in various ways._    \n   \nAgain, John had expressed it well and I agree with his assessment.   \n   \nHHP: _\\>But would you also make the outlines somewhat bumpy, and the baseline somewhat jumpy?_   \n   \nNo and maybe.   \n   \nAB: _(Was the original Specimen brochure on coated?)_    \n   \nThe original specimen of Electra (more of an elaborate announcement, really) was printed on a laid-finish book paper. All of the individual specimen books for Dwiggins's types that I have seen were printed on book papers.   \n   \nI believe that Dwiggins and Griffith would have been striving to balance the performance of the type on both uncoated and coated papers; that is why they proofed everything on several different papers. The aim was to hit the weight and contrast so that the type was neither too dazzling on coated, nor too sluggish on uncoated.   \n   \nI find the digital Electra too dazzling even on uncoated.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n",

If I were going as far as editing a font to make it more useful to me, I would make whatever alterations _I_ thought beneficial. My point is that this approach is quite different from conducting a 'revival', which obliges one to refer to the original and to conduct oneself with some respect. What I'm talking about is a kind of pragmatic sacrilege.\n\n"

If you can imagine what that's like.   \n   \nSome answers to belated quiries. Yes overinking is the norm. I'd say you could almost define fine printing as a noble attempt to prevent this.   \n   \nFuzziness in letterpress is usually the result of paper dust accumulating on ink residue on the beard of the face. Constant wiping of the form will eliminate this but in long edition runs it will be more common. Tends to be more of a problem with photopolymer because of the shallow relief surface.   \n   \nI notice in the Linotype specimen book, yes, printed on calendered stock, that almost all the very small text sizes exhibit baseline shifting of certain characters. This is also a characteristic of Monotype. I'd say this may be deliberate, for legibility, but I can't recall that I've ever noticed it in foundry castings. It always looked wrong to me. When working with Monotype, in which the matrix position is adjusted by the operator, I always suspected incorrect alignment. I'd say the same with Linotype but the specimen was produced by the firm so I doubt that it was a mechanical aberration.   \n   \nTiffany, its an old saying. From an instructor. Never put words in the mouths of those from different times and different places was the explanation. I think that is good advice.\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant   \n   \nI misunderstood your fuzziness question. Impression is a technique to facilitate correct inking. Given all the various factors that come into play during presswork there is only a variance of about a thousands of an inch that will provide you with a consistent pattern of inking based on impression. Too little impression and you will be consistently overinking to compensate. Too much impression and you are encouraging inkspread no matter what the pattern of inking. The feathering you are seeing is ink growing (forced) into the paper fibers. Traditional oil-based letterpress inks dry by absorption, so there is a tendency for them to want to travel.   \n   \nSo, to answer Tiffancy, IMHO overinking and underinking is not a matter of taste, impression is a technical consideration. If you want to have clarity of letterform, inking and impression have to be coordinated.   \n   \nOn difficult stock, many fine printers would deliberately print \"gray\" with a \"kiss\" impression just to preserve this. Since a lot of graphic designers today want the crunch and splat look, a lot of contemporary letterpress folk will accomodate them. In that regard, taste is everything. You wouldn't want to see dear Electra that way though.\n\n"

Would you   \n\\>incorporate such \"misalignment\" into your own work? On what grounds,   \n\\>by what degree(s), and with what techniques?_      \n   \nI have contemplated this very thing. An early version of Whitman had a fairly large overshoot on some characters and looking back at early proofs, I think there was a certain vitality that this may have lent to the line in text sizes and I am faintly sorry that I was so quick to regularize it out. At the least, I think it bears some more exploration and I will likely revisit the ideas in my next design.   \n   \nWhen I am able, I hope to ascertain whether or not Dwiggins deliberately designed these apparent inconsistencies in alignment into his types and to what extent. I have no concrete proof now, but it wouldn't surprise me if he did. I say this based on other elements that he and Griff consciously allowed to be inconsistent. In a letter from February 1931, regarding early proofs of Electra, Dwig wrote to Griff: \"There is a variety in the weights of stems and in serif details. I think this is not bad -- better than if they all measured exactly the same. Might it not be good to keep these varieties -- differences in serifs, in weight and shape of stems (as between 'i r j' for example; and the long stems of 'b d k h l') rather than to adopt one particular stem or serif as standard and bring them all to that one?\" Following this, in his typescript dossier on the project, Griffith appends this annotation: \"[This is the essence of good design, little understood or slothfully disregarded by the best of designers. A notable example of the effect of such variety of detail on the movement of letters is to be seen in the cutting of Linotype Monticello.]\"   \n   \nFrom this I am lead to believe that in examining Dwiggins's types, idiosyncrasies and irregularities are not to be automatically discounted as imperfections of the mechanical processes. That is not to say that every slant and wiggle is intentional and should be slavishly followed, just that they must be considered carefully.   \n   \nFor one thing, a digital font, like it or not, will be used at any number of sizes. As a type gets larger these inconsistencies become more visible and no longer contribute the desired effect. In a note on the uncompleted project for a 24-point Electra, Dwiggins observed: \"The details of serif, etc., begin to be seen in 24 pt., and need to be more uniform than in 12.\" And also \"The slight concavity of the stems needs to be uniform throughout for the above reason.\" So even if inconsistencies were designed into the 12 point master, it might in fact not be feasible to incorporate these into a contemporary font, given today's practices and aesthetics. I have no conclusions yet, just an interest in delving deeper into the matter.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

In fact, one could even explain why the smaller sizes have more variance than the larger: readability versus aesthetics.

I read this a long time ago, but remember it distinctly, because at the time I thought it was a surprising concept. He said something about too much regularity inhibiting readability. I've been looking for it for the last couple of days, because this keeps coming up in this thread, but have not found it yet.   \n   \nDigital Electra: what Dwiggins was desiging towards was not the patern drawings or the metal type itself, but the inked image of the type on paper. His pattern drawings were not the finished product; they were what would give him the letter forms he wanted when printed. This is something completely different than desiging a face that looks like it was printed via letterpress.   \n   \nElectra italic vs. cursive: the italic is interesting to see in mass, because its almost exactly like the roman in color. The cursive, because of all the rounder shapes, has a different effect. An single italic word in a sentence set in roman is nearly invisible; there is not enough contrast for it to stand out clearly, while the cursive contrasts well.   \n   \nHrant: if you want to play with blurred letters, just put a fine gray stroke around them. Pretty much any page layout or drawing program will let you do this. This gives the effect of a slight blur. It's a trick I use a lot when doing illustrations; an outline in about a 25\n\n"

By Moxon's time (1683), they were using a number of standard colors. The reds he mentions are Vermillion and Red-Lead. Usually paper would effect the color. With current standardization of colors (PMS) there would be no signifigance difference between any method. There are transparent whites and opaque whites, however, that when used with colored pigment will provide variance of opacity. Don't really know how to answer your question though.\n\n"

Most likely Electra may as well have met with consumer resistance when it was issued as a metal face for the very same reasons for which you are now rejecting the digital. It wasn't exactly the most popular face of its time period. Given only the minor discrepencies between the two specimens I furnished Hrant, I'd say, that with a font-editing program, you could easily adjust the digital to that of the original. That would not solve the problem though. It would still be even more spindly. Since there was a bold version issued in metal as well as digital, I'd also suggest that a meatier version (demi-bold) could possibly be put together using Fontographer's or FontLab ability to interpolate between two adjusted masters. Then you'd have the color you prefer, without the outline disturbance of inkspread, as in the earlier specimens shown here.\n\n"

And the italic would be a separate purchase per size, as would the bold. A sizeable investment. One of the reasons the idea of offering sizes during the photofilm years was abandoned was because the consumer resisted buying extra sizes when they could just as easily photographically enlarge the one size they did buy. The same resistance would be met with today with digital type. The onus is less here on the manufacturer than it is on the consumer. Monotype, for one, did try to offer various sizes or a font during the photofilm years and it was an unsucessful effort. There was no good market reason to continue this practice with digital type.   \n   \nIt would be even more spindly because my reading of the metal and digital specimens indicated that certain strokes and crossbars on the metal were actually thinner than the digital.

Which is why I try to be very careful to qualify my opinions and to provide as many primary source citations as possible -- to show how I arrive at my interpretations.

We can only speculate. Indeed, one of his later typefaces, Arcadia, was intended as a very light face -- \"round and crisp -- like the new moon one day out -- a trimming of Diana's toe-nail . . .\" If I'm calculating WAD's dimensioning correctly, it would be about 60 em units in stem width at 12 point -- slightly lighter than Joanna. But it had less contrast than the digital Electra.   \n   \nReturning to that. Dwiggins's own comments in the introduction of Electra include this statement: \"The face, as may be seen from this specimen, falls within the 'modern' family of type styles, but it is drawn to avoid the extreme contrast between 'thick' and 'thin' elements that marks most 'modern' faces.\" I'm not sure this applies so well to the current version.   \n   \nIt is an excess in this contrast -- the ratio of thicks and thins -- that I interpret Dwiggins to mean when he refers to \"dazzle\" in this assessment of an early proof of the 24-point Electra experiment: \"The 2/17/37 experimental l.c. seems to me to have a 'dazzle' due to too much variety of color. . . . I have kept close to this stem weight, but have tried to iron out dazzle by getting the range of color more uniform as you can see from the thin-papers marked 'revised'.\" [\"Thin papers\" refers to Dwiggins's working drawings.]   \n   \nA screen-resolution scan may not fully convey this, but the contrast ratio in the letters that WAD refers to is less than that in the digital Electra.   \n   \n ![Electra 24 pt proof](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019145136im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7572.gif)   \nElectra no. 55, 24 point experimental proof   \n   \n ![digital Electra](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019145136im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7573.gif)   \nDigital Electra   \n   \nIf Dwiggins felt that the 24-point proof was too dazzling, I imagine that he might have thought the 12-point digital to be even more so. I certainly do.

And we are surely looking with different eyes. It is probably time for us to agree to disagree. I remain a little puzzled, however, -- and forgive me if I am misrepresenting you -- but your statement seems to imply that the way that the type was presented to the public by the manufacturer when it was first introduced was not the way the manufacturer intended, or that the way the type was presented in projects designed and printed under the direction of the type designer were somehow less accurate representations of the typeface than the showing in Big Red. I am not trying to denigrate the showing that you are referring to; I'm just not convinced that it necessarily lays a greater claim to the ideal representation than other examples.   \n   \nBTW, when was the big red book published?   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

I haven't addressed the issues you mention (the initial presentation, Dwiggins' direction, etc).   \n   \nBut you are comparing the digital to Dwiggins' 24 point, which was never produced. I believe my point was that the specimens in Big Red were (produced). And the digital is a near match for the 14 point. And the specimens are very clean. I think that's about it.   \n   \nDwiggins' intentions are obviously of interest, and you've brought that out very well, but the history of type design is full of intentions fouled up by the economics and production practices of the manufacturer. The digital face evolved not from these intentions, that's clear to both of us (I think). My \"goal\" here was simply to find out where it did evolve from, for better or worse.\n\n"

Most of the great \"fat\" specimen books appeared in the 1920s to early 1930s (ATF, BB&S, Linotype, Monotype, etc) but did not necessarily carry date of publication, copyright or whatever. These were all published presumably before copyright became a significant issue and the Depression was reality.\n\n"
