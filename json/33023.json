But what would our monthly newsletter be without the fonts themselves? This April, we are proud to announce the release of a small sans serif family from Adrian Frutiger and Akira Kobayashi that has long been in the works: Nami. Also, we shine a spotlight on a little-known gem from the 1950s, Aldo Novarese’s Fluidum.\n\n[Read the rest of the Linoletter at Linotype.com!](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911194239/http:/www.linotype.com/38-21664/issue200704.html)\n\nOr, [subscribe to the Linoletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911194239/https:/www.linotype.com/newsletter.html), and get the information delivered every month directly to your mailbox.\n\n",
