I guess I'm just in the mindset that after becoming quite proficient with the pen tool, primarily vectorizing letterforms which require fairly anal precision, it's just not right unless I do it by hand.\n\n"

      "content": "The main thing to bear in mind is that the higher resolution the scan the better autotrace will cope with it (albeit slowly and with too many points). There's a lot to be said for high resolution greyscale tiffs of pencil drawings rather than vector graphics, you will never achieve the same texture by tracing manually or by machine. That said, it is worth looking at the options for live trace in the drop down menu you can get very different results. If the drawings are intended to be smooth and untextured you are better off beziering by hand over a placed scan as trace creates compound paths which to my mind hamper revisions. Magnus' example looks good on screen at that size but zooming in tight there will be all sorts of marks that aren't pencil-like.\n\nI miss Dimensions (and to a lesser extent Streamline), I use it at home in classic mode.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "Live Trace and Live Paint can both be really powerful tools, if you throw the right kind of artwork at those filters.\n\nI never liked Adobe Streamline and have played around with it through several versions, starting with the one that shipped with Illustrator 4.0 back in the early 1990s. The problem is vector trash in the resulting conversions.\n\nVector trash isn't really all that bad if all you intend to do it send the artwork to print or post it on a web page. I work in a large custom sign manufacturing company. For my purposes, the artwork needs to be really clean or at least consist of all closed paths. Streamline would generate lots and lots of little, stroked 2 point line segments and lots of other open path segments which were absolutely useless.\n\nI agree about the comments on manually digitizing artwork. IMHO, Photoshop has the best pen tool and combination of keyboard shortcuts found in any program capable of making vector objects. Once you get used to the keyboard shortcuts it's fairly easy to accurately digitize sketches and other line art. However, if the artwork is technical in nature and not so \"organic\" it will be easier to do the work in Illustrator (or Freehand or CorelDRAW).\n\nPhotoshop's \"Make Work Path\" command can do wonders on quickly creating vector artwork from high contrast scanned images -and do so by creating paths which are usually always full closed loops. Naturally, you'll need to tweak the brightness/contrast settings and perhaps even use a few blur and sharpen passes. If the artwork is clean enough, fire up the Color Range dialog, play with the fuzziness slider and then create a selection. Then execute the Make Work Path command and export the resulting path to Illustrator format.\n\n"

Adobe did not develop Streamline and did not have rights to the code, they just distributed it.\n\nDavid,\n\nWhen you refer to \"Auto Trace\" (which you've done in multiple posts), do you mean the Live Trace feature in CS2, or do you mean the Auto Trace tool in earlier versions?\n\nThe two have very different capabilities, so it would be good to know which you mean, especially when making comparisons to Streamline.\n\nI agree that hand-tracing will always give the cleanest results. Personally I would not use any automatic tracing function of any program for letterforms or simple logos or other designs that should have precise geometric contours. Live Trace is at its strongest for posterizing photos or very complex but not precise images, where hand-tracing would be prohibitively time consuming, and some degree of impressionistic distortion is a desired design goal. Which probably is not the most relevant application to a typophile discussion.\n\n"
