I’ve realized that to me, it’s not about saving the few bucks, it’s about staying myself in this world, staying independent, handling my own emergencies “manually”. And I’m certainly not one to shun communication; it just seems to me that any communication done by telephone (mobile or landline, actually) can almost never be really relevant - and I hate wasting time.\n\nIf I ever get a mobile phone, it’ll be to observe the lowly but proud  \nfootsoldier that is the bitmap font in action, in the trenches.\n\nhhp\n\n"

It’s just too bad America only marketed the phones to business men and missed the boat on bring communication to places like China where it’s too expensive to put in land phone lines. Many people use their phones as a main phone in Europe and around the world.\n\n"

I don’t always take it with me. I like the convenience of it. I hate the installed ring tone choices and the fact that you have to pay if you want a different one (none of which are much better). I hate the ergonomics of the phone I got. Just about everything about the way it’s designed is ridiculous. Next time I will choose more wisely.\n\nI miss the old Bell Telephone models.
