Another option is peer recognition; competitions, awards, and the like. So, with apologies for any I may have forgotten, the TDC has awarded:  \nNassim by Titus Nemeth,  \nTisa by Mitja Miclavcic,  \nCalouste by Miguel Sousa,  \nMaiola by Veronika Burian,  \nNoam by Adi Stern,  \nGentium by Victor Gaultney, and  \nRayuela by Alejandro lo Celso.\n\nThe Creative Review also awarded student projects: Veronika's Maiola and Malou Verlomme's Ficus.\n\nNot strictly an answer to your question, but laudable nevertheless is the work of Tim Ahrens, which has garnered considerable recognition while Tim is a part-time student.\n\nAnd, attempting foresight, I am sure that David Cabianca's Cardea will turn many heads when it is eventually released.\n\n"

This may be further limited, as the glut of new designs made even the best school projects drown in the many-to-be-marketed by around 2000, (2000 - 22yrs.old - 2 yrs. marketing to make famous font = 1976 birth). bringing the range of possible fame in fonts in school to but 16 possible graduating classes. On the other side, one could not study with a public type design product until 1987 at the earliest, (- 22yrs.old - 2 yrs. marketing = 1963 birth) bringing the possible years down to 13 for anyone who adopted Fontographer as early as 1987...\n\n...so I'd be interested in how many you find.\n\nCheers!\n\n"
