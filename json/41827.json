  "content": "Hi All,\n\nOne of the students that works in my office asked for my help putting a certificate of appreciation together, and I wanted to get some good typophile input first. I've seen plenty of such certificates, but none that were actually thoughtfully put together.\n\nSo what kind of typography is appropriate for such a certificate?\n\nThanks for any thoughts on the matter.\n\n-Casey\n\n",
