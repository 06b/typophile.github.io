      "content": "Mid Victorian style. Not certain if typefaces or engraved. Three styles. Top & bottom lines seem to match a widely used 19th century typeface -- Lightface Celtic. You can decide for yourself based on the attached specimen of the full character set.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141228194051im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LghtFaceCeltic@PhillipsOTTBp16@20percent_3715.jpg)\n  \nI can't find a digitized font that matches, but there may be something under another name.  \nAs for the fancy font, again I can't find a digital match. The base font is sometimes called Roman Rimmed.  \nThe Roman is a somewhat more nuanced version of the Fatface fonts of the early 19th century, of which several are digitized, e.g. Normande.  \nRimmed refers to the fine line around the core of the font.  \nThe fill of horizontal lines was a fairly common technique. The use of two sets of lines makes it an interesting variation.  \nThe fancy font could be made as a bespoke font.  \nDon \n"
