  "content": "Hello, I have an assignment for my fundamentals of Graphic Design class to design a postcard. I need help with the typography. Mainly the logo position. This design already went through a critique at school and the professor thought I could do better. Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nBy the way the second .Jpeg was my original placement, the professor suggested maybe putting the logo on top. I donâ€™t like it there.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20091129144004/http:/typophile.com/files/1_26.jpg) | 87.42 KB |\n| [2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20091129144004/http:/typophile.com/files/2_27.jpg) | 87.37 KB |\n\n",
