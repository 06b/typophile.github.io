If you guys could provide some input and suggestions I would really appreciate it. Anything helps I what to really improve it for the month of April. One of the challenges is that it has to be bi-lingual so it’s kinda hard to do diferent layouts.\n\nIt’s in pdf format this is the direct link:\n\n[http://vidanueva.cc/spanish/recursos.../Feb%20NLC.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911194156/http:/vidanueva.cc/spanish/recursos.../Feb%20NLC.pdf \"http://vidanueva.cc/spanish/recursos.../Feb%20NLC.pdf\")\n\nI really want to improve my typography skill specialy since I found this site.\n\nThanks for your help\n\n [‹ Caslon page](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911194156/http:/typophile.com/node/18703 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Wedding Invites crit ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911194156/http:/typophile.com/node/18484 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Try to cut down on all the different fonts - consistency doesn’t have to be boring.\n\nEven on the cover if you could take out one of the fonts and re-use one of the other ones, it would eliminate some of the clutter that is facing you in the rest of the project. You could also turn the March & April section into 2 columns and fill that space while opeing up the rest below for more white space.\n\nAnd watch out for that white on yellow stuff, I can barely read it and that’s on the computer, it won’t get better when printed.\n\n—-\n\n"

I rally feel the need to improve on a personal level.\n\nAbout making two colums of the future events I thought of that but I wanted both March and April as sudheads and their weren’t enough dates for April.\n\nAny suggestions on the body text I should use or anything like that?\n\n"

      "content": "Kristian,\n\nThe reason most people don’t like it is because it’s a MS knock-off of a solid sans, you may know. HELVETICA. MS decided they didn’t want to pay menial licensing fees to use it, so they commissioned someone to make something nearly like it.\n\nThat being said, type should be designed for need, or specific use in the aesthetic realm. Getting around licensing fees isn’t considered an aesthetic need,therefore it is considered weak. There is a bit of difference, the tops of the t’s are chopped off, the leg of the R is different etc... I think part of has to do with overuse, I just prefer to use the real thing. Set a block of text in Arial and then in Helvetica, and see which reads better.\n\nGaramond in good body text. I’d have to agree w/ Nick on the too many fonts end. Do you have any kind of budget in the printing dept. you could talk into buying nice display family? I think if you get a nice modern sans with a bit more character that Arial/Helvetica.\n\nEric\n\n"
