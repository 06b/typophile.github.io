  "content": "Hello my name is James leahy and this is one of my first fonts. I am trying to take inspiration for the Russian style of serif type with its sharp corners but I wanted to bring this in the san serif style and soften it up a bit in order not to look so harsh. The typeface is unnamed and I haven't started working on the spacing yet but I would really like to hear if there is anything wrong with the design or opinions about the design and style.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Untitled.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100247/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled_29.jpg) | 187.04 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hi James,  \nsome of your characters are rounded, some are made up of straight lines with sharp corners; some are skewed, some not. The proportions and line widths of the characters also do not match. You should stick to a common style for your letters.  \nMy advice is to first draw simple letter forms as a beginner before you try to design a typeface with a lot of idiosyncrasies.\n\n"
