Does it sort of work? Any suggestions?\n\nI am a _complete_ newbie in this area, so be nice :-)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/Electra1_4207.jpg)\n\n",

I think it will work better left aligned or centered over the longest line of the poem—something Bringhurst mentions.\n\nIs the title’s font Univers? I would think that something more ‘flavored’ might work better. Just Electra in a heavier weight or larger size may work very well, depending on the nature of the poetry. Using all the same typeface will give a quieter effect.\n\nAlso I don’t know about the grey. If you want grey you will probably have to up the weight of the title so it balances with the text.\n\nOn tracking: Since you said your concern is how it will look laser-printed to send to publishers, you would best experiment with its effect on the printed product. How it looks on screen is not reliable, as the laser printing will thicken it, and screen always looks different anyway.\n\n"

      "content": "I wonder if it might be worth trying to output your pages with an _inkjet_ printer. My Epson 900 (PostScript, quite old now) and Epson 2200 (bought in 2004, not PostScript) both make the color of the type significantly darker than my Apple LaserWriter 360 (13 years old and still going strong!!!). The LaserWriter is truer to the digital original, but in the case of what you desire for the Electra, you don’t want faithfulness, you want fullness!\n\nAs Patty said above, the digital version of Electra is pale and skinny compared to the original metal version, I think in large part because what’s missing in the digital is the effect of the ink squeeze that would always be present in letterpress printing on uncoated paper. Let me be clear about results, too: this is with digital type fonts output to an imagesetter and printed by offset, vs. brass matrices used to cast lines of type which are then printed by letterpress, well printed and not overinked.\n\nBelow you will find a comparison between the original 12-pt. Electra set in metal, and a digital version also set at 12-pt. The scan of the metal Electra was carefully made and was not altered to make it look heavier. It comes from the actual booklet released by Mergenthaler Linotype to announce the type in the 1930s.\n\nNo wonder you think there is a difference!\n\nSo I’d say if you like Electra (and it’s a wonderful type!), play around with different papers and output devices to see if you can gain some body weight in your final printed versions, even if the type looks too scrawny on-screen. After all, the only thing that matters is the appearance of the final printed result in the hands of the reader, not how you got there.\n\nHope this is of some help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/electra_letterpress_digital_6605.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "\\>Yes, obviously there were subtle changes whenever any font was adapted from metal  \n\\>to film to digital, but for some reason the digitization of Electra is particularly anemic.\n\nI suspect that this is because, while metal fonts were designed to be point size specific (10pt was different from 12pt, which was different from 24pt, etc.), photo and digital fonts tend not to be. Often, the new digital font is based on **one** of the older specific sizes only.\n\nElectra’s digital version has both text and Display cuts ( [http://www.linotype.com/363/electra-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20070403074000/http:/www.linotype.com/363/electra-family.html)). I know that even the text is light, compared with the metal version. I don’t know much about the birth of the digital version. I think it was prepared at Mergenthaler Linotype in the US, while there was still a design office there, in the early 1990s.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>tracking work proportionally to font size?\n\nGenerally speaking, large sizes need to be tracked tighter, unless they are ‘optical sizes’ designed for that size.\n\nThat’s why the screen is unreliable, and proofing highly desirable: at large screen sizes—necessary because of low screen resolution—what will look good will be too tight in a 10 or 12 point print out.\n\nBecause of the lightness of Electra (a fault in the digital type), Bob may well be right that it benefits from tighter tracking at text size. From a type designer’s point of view, at text sizes the designed spacing should work well as a default.\n\n"

That means at a given nominal size it will be blacker and reduced contrast—and so resemble more the print, though I don’t know how closely. However, squashing the extenders (especially the g) seriously changes the look of the face.\n\nMaybe some of the Dwiggens experts can tell us more about the history of Elante.\n\nedit: looking a McGrew’s “American Metal Typefaces”, I don’t find it. So it was never available generally in metal. I am guessing it was a modification for phototype, as in that era they \\*loved\\* the big x-height. There are probably other differences, but the extenders was the first thing that hit me.\n\n"
