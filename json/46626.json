      "content": "_You shouldn’t stay in the same position for too long._\n\nThe way the industry is structured and positions set up, it isn’t possible to stay in any one position for too long. I work on a contractual basis for an agent who finds me work. I don’t hold an actual position or job as such. I’m given jobs to do for numerous clients. My agent sends me in, I go in, do the job, get out real quickly. I ams da semantic hitman. Much of it I do from my desk at home. The hardest part is getting paid.\n\n_If it’s good, it transcends language._\n\nYes and no. Some ads I’ve worked on are “good” by industry standards, but they don’t transcend language. Others kick arse in a purely visual capacity with no use of verbal or written language at all, but they still involve semantics, and in that sense are transcendent.\n\n_Working in the industry will affect your family life at some point._\n\nYes, but so what, working in any industry will affect your family life.\n\n_It creates careers for art-school dropouts._\n\nYes, most definitely. I never bothered finishing art school because it was packed with wankshafts, most of who I now compete with on a professional basis.\n\n_The same concepts are endlessly recycled._\n\nOh spit yeah. But it’s a high-pressure industry. It eats people and devours ideas.\n\n_You fast-forward through the boring stuff._\n\nWho, ad people or consumers?\n\n_The Internet took it to a whole new level._\n\nYes it did. Some people ask me why I don’t have an online portfolio when I’m an ad writer/concept guy and the internet surely is cutting edge for self-promotion in that line. The answer is — I don’t need one, my agent gets me all the work I can handle. The same people ask me why my agent doesn’t have a website. The answer is — they don’t need one either. They use the traditional tools of the trade; a paper notepad, an eraser pencil and a phone. Job sourcing and media buyers use the internet only sparingly to promote themselves. The business really doesn’t work that way. Everything that happens is a foregone conclusion predicated on existing relationships between people who are “in the business”.\n\n_It’s hard to transition out of._\n\nYes, very hard. I’m a failed filmmaker so I took the next best thing. Now I want out but it’s hard, very hard to get “out”, so wish me success with my type designs because I’m a lot like an actor — I don’t know how to do anything else, and I’m gettin’ old.\n\n_They both have weird self-congratulatory award shows._\n\nYepp. The internet awards shows are much wierder and self-congratulatory than anything I’ve seen in advertising.\n\n_Only the people who create it are delusional enough to call it art._\n\nI don’t call it art, and most people I work with don’t pretend it’s art either. It’s soft soap (industry term). I’ve met people who create it and call it art, and those are the people I avoid working with.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
