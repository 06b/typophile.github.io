  "content": "Hello Typophiles.\n\nI'm currently finishing up the International Studies part of a Visual Communication/International Studies double degree, and have been living & studying in Bordeaux, France for the past 9 months or so.\n\nThe deadline for my final research project -- a 5000-word research project on an aspect of France or French society, of your choosing -- is a few months away now, and what I've decided to do is explore/investigate the links between traditional Basque lettering styles (mentioned [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020192749/http:/typophile.com/node/19079) on Typophile, and here's a [cursory](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020192749/http:/flickr.com/photos/neregauzak/5738933/) [flickr](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020192749/http:/flickr.com/photos/neregauzak/5768745/) [search](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020192749/http:/flickr.com/photos/adamrice/272394970/)) and concepts of Basque nationalism.\n\nWhile there's a wealth of stuff on Basque identity and nationalism in its various guises, I've struggled to find information on the Basque lettering/type in journal databases and magazine archives and [this post on Social Design Notes](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020192749/http:/backspace.com/notes/2004/10/10/x.html) was almost all Google would give me). So if anyone could point me in the direction of books, journal articles, or even people that might be able to shed some light on this, that would be great. I'm open to resources in French and English (and I have some very basic Spanish).\n\nAnd an aside, while I've got you here:\n\nI'm hoping to maybe do a few comparisons -- any tips on other contemporary or historical connections between type and national identity? I ordered a copy of Shaw & Bain's \"Blackletter: Type and National Identity\" the other day -- a contemporary Basque country/WWII Germany comparison seems like it could be quite interesting both visually and ideologically, but off the top of my head that's all I've got so far, and it's been written about so many times before in theses etc.\n\nAnyway. This is getting a little longwinded. Love to hear your thoughts/ideas!  \nAnd I've attached one of the flickr photos I linked to above, just in case you're unfamiliar with the style (although there can be quite a bit of variation).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020192749im_/http:/typophile.com/files/272394970_e9bad05ed9_3941.jpg)\n\n",

Contrasting with the way Uncial type is used to denote Irishness might be more apropriate? The bonus would be the research involving various Irish pubs in your area.\n\n"

I might try and get in touch with the guy who runs that site.\n\nHrant & Sii, I think you're both right here: the Germany/blackletter thing was just the first thing that came to mind when I started thinking about type & nationalism. I might still mention it in passing though.\n\nThe Uncial/Gaelic script options do seem like better ideas.\n\nWondering though: has a lot been written on Gaelic script? This could turn very niche very quickly -- especially since I'm writing this for an arts/sociology-type degree, not my design one. Also wondering if the political associations are as strong here? This is all pretty uncharted territory for me.\n\nAll this said, I'm not sure how big the \"comparative\" part of my piece is going to be, given that the whole thing is relatively short.\n\n"
