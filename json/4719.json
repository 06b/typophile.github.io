These typefaces can be found in the May edition of the [Veer Visual Elements Catalog](http://web.archive.org/web/20130916195837/http:/www.veer.com/ideas/catalogs/) and on our web site.   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Jukebox Stephanie Marie](http://web.archive.org/web/20130916195837im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/35646.gif)   \n   \n [Stephanie Marie](http://web.archive.org/web/20130916195837/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?Image=JBT0000067) by Jason Walcott **{ Jukebox }** They say lower loops in handwriting indicate sensuality. No wonder new Stephanie Marie is so attractive. A lively, brush-style script font, named after a dear friend of the designer. Contains several alternate characters and ligatures. One weight.   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Jukebox Fanfare](http://web.archive.org/web/20130916195837im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/35647.gif)   \n   \n [Fanfare](http://web.archive.org/web/20130916195837/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?Image=JBT0000066) by Jason Walcott **{ Jukebox }** Drum roll please... Fanfare marches out with jubilant style. A happy, shiny headline typeface reminiscent of game show and situation comedy titles from the late 60s and early 70s. One weight.   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \nFor more information regarding these new type products, contact:   \n   \nJacqueline Wallace   \n403 313 4942   \n [media@veer.com](mailto:media@veer.com)\n\n",
