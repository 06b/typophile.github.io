  "content": "So I snagged this from the latest HOW magazine; it’s a sample of “Market Icons” from Publix Super Markets. I tried identifont and WTF to no avail. Thought I’d serve it up to the experts... also, if no one knows the exact font I’d be interested in recommendations for similar fonts; I was really attracted to the lowered X height and the simplicity of the letters.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234811im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_4656.jpg)\n\n [‹ a little sister for the urw++ saa?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234811/http:/typophile.com/node/39863 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help with this font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234811/http:/typophile.com/node/40020 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Really.\n\nNeutraface is a very popular face!\n\nP.S. I removed Bogie’s photo — this one is of Ollie with Lauren. He’s almost 9 months old.... they grow up fast.\n\nP.P.S.

They ask a million questions about characters you rarely use like Q and J and fail to ask some very basic questions about the type of font it is, that might narrow things down a lot further.\n\nWhatTheFont wouldn’t get this either because MyFonts doesn’t carry House Industries fonts. They only search their own database.\n\nI find Bowfin can be useful for this sort of thing:\n\n[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234811/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html \"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html\")\n\n(edited, so will fall out of order...)\n\n"
