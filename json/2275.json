As a former Boeing employee I was aware of that because they told us that formal documents had to use it for certain pages, in certain contexts.   \n   \nThere are probably a number of heavier weight squared sans serif fonts, such as Font Bureau [Agency Wide](http://web.archive.org/web/20130409202944/http:/www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FB00000234P1), that could resemble this if they are slanted properly and spaced somewhat tightly.\n\n"
