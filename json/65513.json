  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nI was really hoping there would be a way to justify lines by automatically adjusting their font size. I have searched for hours to find a solution, but the only solution I can find is ye olde 'do it by hand' method.\n\nCan somebody please help me?\n\nTo be clear, here are some examples of what I mean:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kua_annual_report_08_4944.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/house_girard_book_10_6565.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/museoslab_2_6653.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/aiga-wrap-full_6396.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-lrg_6320.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/9976_6022.gif)\n\nI hope someone can help.

      "content": "I'd love to know if there is an automated method, too. When I do a type treatment like this, I set each line to full justify and stop resizing when the line's spacing seems about right. Of course, this can produce slightly irregular spacing if you're not careful.\n\nSomeone could probably write a script for InDesign to do this automatically, but I doubt there's one floating around out there. You can check the [InDesign Secrets](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025509/http:/indesignsecrets.com/resources/plug-ins-and-scripts) scripts page if you want to look for one.\n\n"

(Don't forget to put guidelines where the optical margin should be.)  \nAnd if you need to finetune the left margin, insert a thin space before the first character and kern against that.  \nTakes time! :)\n\n"
