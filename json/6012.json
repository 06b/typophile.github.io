My dilemma is this: do I hang the bullets outside the margin or not? Opinions on this matter are appreciated!   \n   \n [http://www.stereotypography.com/bullets.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825210133/http:/www.stereotypography.com/bullets.jpg)\n\n",

It is absurd have a page full of bullets, as they no longer highlight anything. I think they will look bad wherever you put them.   \n   \nI think the bullets need to go. Then you can try a variety of solutions, such as having the titles bigger or bolder and the list as is, indented without the bullets, with items separated by extra leading. Or have the lists with hanging indents, no bullet, etc.\n\n"

Bullets used like this typically distract from the content.   \n   \nAll that said, when I use bullets, they don't hang outside of the main body margins.
