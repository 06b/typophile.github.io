  "content": "I was at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston this past weekend, and all of the titling for the Miwa Yanagi exhibition was printed in huge letters on the wall in this typeface. It looks like a phone book typeface (given the ink wells), but I don't know any phone book typefaces besides Bell Centennial (which it is very obviously not). Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115065819im_/http:/typophile.com/files/publication_4213.gif)\n\nI'm sorry I don't have a bigger picture, but I think you can get the idea.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I can't find a picture, but the y was especially strange. The tail started straight down from the center (with an ink well to either side), then slanted left.\n\nHere's a (poorly drawn) example:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115065819im_/http:/typophile.com/files/y_6323.gif)\n\n",
