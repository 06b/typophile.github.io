  "content": "G'day people,\n\nI have a copy of Archive Lightface extended and I can't figure out where I got it from and whether or not it's legit. I can't seem to get any font info on my home PC (no font managment). I'm wondering whether anyone knows if it has been bundled with any Adobe products / MS products in the past.  \ncheers\n\n--N\n\n",
