For the rest, it looks like some sort of [Bauhaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107072115/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus) stencil.\n\nEDIT: unfortunately, even the stencil version of [Blippo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107072115/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/blippo-lt) does not have the right stencil. Another good base font would be [Pump](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107072115/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pump-lt).\n\n"
