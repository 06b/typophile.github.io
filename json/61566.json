  "content": "My Laserjet P2015 does 1200x1200 dpi. The text looks very crisp and clean.\n\nI'm testing a Brother HL 2170w (non-PostScript), which costs far less than my Laserjet, yet it boasts an \"HQ2400\" dpi of 2400x600.\n\nText printed in this 2400x600 mode looks quite a bit thicker and darker, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing. Frankly, I think this 2400x600 feature is rather dubious, and I often see it on low-cost/budget lasers.\n\nThe odd thing is that the Brother's 600 dpi output looks nearly the same as my Laserjet's 1200 dpi output, although the Laserjet's text looks slightly cleaner. Mind you, OS X HP drivers have never been stellar.\n\nWhat's this gimmicky 2400x600 dpi all about? I also noticed that a couple of sites seem to understand it as 600x2400.\n\n",

It's only available through \"page setup\" in the actual application.\n\nWhen I print a .pdf, however, I do get the option in the printer pane.\n\nIn either case, the text looks the same.\n\n"

One of my favourites is 2400dpi that turns out to be 4-colour 600dpi.\n\nThe only thing to do is to get test pages printed, preferably from a document you prepare so you can directly compare results.\n\n"

In any case, this is what you get for $120.\n\n"
