  "content": "This is a typewriter inspired typeface I have been working on when things are slow at work. I would appreciate any advice on how to tighten the whole thing up. I realize that the kerning is abysmal, I think I should get the characters working first though.   \n   \nWhat I'm trying to accomplish is a typeface that is instantly recognizable as a typewriter font, but at the same time is 'cute'. I don't know why I'm compelled to do this, but lately I've been obsessed with typewriter typefaces.   \n   \nI feel the uppercase T and Z are pretty weak, but am uncertain how to tie them in better while still retaining a little cuteness (or maybe this is the problem - they shouldn't be cute).\n\n<!--attachment: unnamed-11001.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*13.4*Unnamed+Typewriter+Font+SWF+file*unnamed%2eswf --><!--attachment: unnamed-11001.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*13.4*Unnamed+Typewriter+Font+SWF+file*unnamed%2eswf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074611im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">Unnamed Typewriter Font SWF file<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074611/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/unnamed-11001.swf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>unnamed.swf</b></a> (13.4 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n",

I would study Goudy's faces, including Goudy sans, as he was the master of the softer look without getting overly cute.   \n   \nI think the stem of the m, n should rise higher, and the i j be taller. They looked squashed below the x height.\n\n"

Here are some samples of it in a more complete state, with the T and Z worked out.   \n   \nOriginally I had the stem on the m and n higher, but it disrupted the flow of the words when reading it, it seemed too jarring, hence the lower version that you now see.

Tardiness aside, I'd like to encourage to follow bj's advice and chat with us folks at Veer about distributing your faces. I am really digging the friendliness and quirkiness of Babbage. Can't wait to see the bold weight. Any plans to tackle an italic version? You could do a lot with those undulating horizontal elements combined with the slight diagonals of an italic.   \n   \nAnyway, contact me if you're at all interested in chatting further.\n\n"
