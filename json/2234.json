I have put the link for the page that shows all the themes they use to categorize their fonts. The SciFi theme has at least three candidates for your sample:   \nNu School Militia, Space Marine and Venus Rising. I did not look through the 22 pages of 'Various' Techno styles, but you might also want to do that if none of these is what you want.\n\n"
