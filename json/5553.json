Using Bickham Script for prologue, quotes at beginning of each chapter, and first letter of chapter alternate capitals.   \n   \nQuestion: Have chosen Caslon as the main book font - will be done using Quark. We had originally decided to use Caslon Pro by Carol Twombly, but the designer already has Caslon 540 in her inventory.   \n   \nIs there a significant difference between Caslon 540 and Caslon Pro?- Would 540 be appropriate for book publishing?   \n   \nThanks,   \nZoe.\n\n",

It had optical compensation for each size so it was designed for text in the smaller sizes. All the digital Caslon 540s I've ever seen appear to be modeled after one of the larger metal sizes. It's especially noticeable in the italics.   \n   \nYou can't really see what text looks like in low res screen graphics very well, but here's 10-point Caslon 540 at about 400%:   \n   \n ![caslon540](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051607im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40355.gif)   \n   \nThe top is Caslon 540 from a 1941 ATF catalog, the bottom one is Adobe's digital version of Caslon 540. To really see the difference, it's best to look at printed samples.\n\n"
