When you find an ad from the collection that is indeed a 1950s ad you have a good chance of duplicating the fonts in it. Some of the word logos on major cigarettes, such as Marlboro, have been made into fonts. By the 1950s much of the display lettering in ads used fonts rather than being hand lettered as in earlier decades. If you do not recognize the fonts in a particular ad, I suggest you send a request, with the image, to the Font ID forum at [http://typophile.com/typeid](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317193046/http:/typophile.com/typeid \"http://typophile.com/typeid\")  \nDon\n\n"
