  "content": "Hello\n\nI'm a graphic design student at the Danish School of Media and Journalism and I'm doing a bit of research on behalf of my school before our visit to TypoBerlin. We do have three days before TypoBerlin where we'd like to visit some relevant studios in Berlin and I wondered if you have some ideas?\n\nWe have though about MetaDesign, EdenSpiekermann, Node Berlin and the Vitra museum, but any ideas would be very helpful.\n\nThank you very much in advance,  \nJulian Hansen\n\n",
