I'm not calling it a typeface because it doesn't have a full character set, so I'm calling it an ornament font which happens to contain letterforms. I've been developingthis thing with Ross Mills for a while now. I think he announced it at aTypeI in 2004, I announced it again at Typecon in August of this year, and we're finally done. We're selling it through Tiro Typeworks at [http://www.tiro.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123204834/http:/www.tiro.com/), and you can see/read a bit more about it at [http://www.bantjes.com/index.php?id=174](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123204834/http:/www.bantjes.com/index.php?id=174).\n\nIt's either extremely useful or completely useless, depending on your point of view, and it comes with instructions. Seriously.\n\n",

So that seems like a no-brainer. But what about the rest?\n\n-marian\n\n"

      "content": "Marian,  \nI think the issue is that your lovely artwork/font has so much of your own self in it that, as a logo, it would be hard to make it work for someone else. Someone would be giving over their identity to become you if they used it. If they made enough changes to make it their own, chosing your art as a basis would make no sense. I would imagine a logo would need to be less you and more whatever the brand was about.  \nFor tshirts and jewelry, you have a real case though. Their is no brand involvement, only the visual appeal of the elements. Your work has plenty of visual and artistic appeal which is clearly part of your being and rightfully so. I think the issue is that this is not so much a typeface as a conceptual work of art who's parts can be rearranged in verbal or just textural patterns. By billing it as a typeface, you open yourself to the weak copyright protections of typefaces in general. You may want to promote it as artwork in the form of software instead. I would talk to a good lawyer like Frank Martinez about it and get a more professional opinion.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

If you have purchased the font(s) license for use on a large scale campaign such as in the course of entertainment promotion, advertising, corporate identity design, product packaging, store signage or in any way that requires the multi media (television, internet, print or other) output of the font(s), an additional license may be required.\"\n\n"

Maybe a restaurant will pick it up & use it'...\n\nSo I was immediately anticipating a prohibited use with no Malice in my heart. Really!\n\nNow I see that's not your intention I confess that I see how you might feel that way. Especially not being a font maker most of the time. But I am not sure if it's an advisable position because unless you make the unusual terms of the EULA extra-clear you could end up spending too much time litigating and not enough time having fun.\n\nMaybe you should allow the currently prohibited uses by making a clear path to an explicit special license for each kind of use. That would be 'rights managed' photo model of licensing.\n\nI don't know though. That's just my 1st reaction.\n\nWhat do you think of this idea?\n\n"

Restraint isn’t the most useful typeface when it comes to serious commercial applications—unless the application happens to be trying to get the look of a Marian Bantjes design without actually spending money on an artist. Type design is not your primary source of income, so it makes plenty of sense to let people know up front that they can’t just go the cheap route and use your font to cash in on your popular work.\n\nOn a related note, this font seems to be catching on with design students including you in their thesis/dissertation work. I already know more than one person who purchased it just for that.\n\n"

I just think that practically speaking people generally expect to be able to do & not do certain things with a font. At least I do. I expect that I may or may not be able to modify a font I license. I expect to be able to use it for one glyph or to print a book. But I really don't expect to be told not to use it in an ID or logo. Unhappy surprises are avoidable. So why not avoid them with a special notice of what is an admittedly unusual EULA?\n\n<cite><br>\nRestraint isn’t the most useful typeface when it comes to serious commercial applications<br>\n</cite>\n\nIt depends. For a computer services company - probably not. But for a Bar, Restaurant or Quilting store or even Soap packaging. It could be legitimately & seriously used.\n\nI also think it could be hard in some ( not all ) circumstances to say if the font is or is not the 'main' element. I mean, who is going to decide? It just seems messy to me. I don't know though. Maybe Marian want to review all the pieces that use her font/design. If it was me I would not.\n\n"

      "content": "I had very mixed feelings about the EULA, because as a designer I had never even read an entire EULA. When I had a studio, I used to skim to find the part re. number of computers & output devices, and that's it. For that reason I have made the unusual exceptions as up-front as possible: they're listed on my web site, again in the instructions and highlighted in red in the EULA. (I will see if Ross can provide a link to the EULA from the site.)\n\nThe vast majority of applications are not problematic: magazines, menus, packaging etc. If someone did have a problem with the EULA, I would question their intent: so you \\*did\\* want to plaster it all over billboards or make jewellery? And in such case I feel justified in feeling indignant. And we do say \"Please contact us for additional licensing.\" Despite my unease, in the end I thought \"\\*\\*\\*\\* it, do I care if Designer X decides not to buy it because they wanted to use it for a logo?\" I don't care.\n\nMessy, unfortunately, yes. There are problems that Ross and I may have to untangle one day.\n\nBut in a bigger sense, I'm curious about the question of what is a [digital] font? Is a font a delivery system of artwork? Or is it a thing in and of itself with inherent or implied rights, or lack thereof?\n\nWhen teaching typography I have sometimes made the analogy between a typeface and a piece of music, where the typeface is the music owned by the artist, and the font is like the CD: a delivery system of that music. You own the CD, but not the music. But even with a CD (or digital file) there are restrictions on how you can use it: but most people understand that while they can play the CD at home or at a party, if they want to use it for their radio commercial, they need to pay more: usually a lot more.\n\nP22's licensing is interesting in that they make a distinction between the dingbats and the letterforms. Presumably this has to do with the long battles over copyright in typeface design, but it's interesting to me that at some point there is this distinction between what is licensable art, and what is not.\n\nThese larger questions of art vs. letterforms and what it means to create a Font are much more interesting to me. Is Restraint art that we can understand should be licensed accordingly, or is it a Font that essentially has no rights, or very few, once the purchase price has been paid? And if so, why? These are largely rhetorical questions, but things that I've struggled with over the past few months as we've hashed out the EULA.\n\n-marian\n\n"

I suppose that the word identities has a very specific, limited meaning for real designers, but being a layman, I'm not too sure where normal use ends, and identity begins.\n\nIf I used Restraint to set my company letterhead, that would be an identity use, right? So I can't use it for business forms like invoices, can I? Okay.\n\nNow, if I wanted to use it in a brochure advertising my new puppet play, I would probably want to use it throughout the material for the show, i.e., the teacher's guides, info sheets, programmes - but then, am I not using it to create an identity for the play? If I can't use it throughout, won't it look rather out of place where I do use it? Hmm ... then purchasing the font would seem like a bad idea. I'm not sure when I could use it.\n\nOr am I just not understanding the word \"identity\". If so, maybe you could gloss it in your EULA.\n\n"

      "content": "Allow me, if you will, to add a few comments on this.\n\nI am perfectly aware that some of these clauses in the basic EULA may cause consternation amongst some. I am perfectly aware that these clauses may well not be legally enforcible in some jurisdictions.\n\nAlso, I am not suggesting that the fair use clause be applied to all other fonts. It is included due to the unique nature of this particular design.\n\nThe usage restrictions that apply to the basic license are an issue of fairness. Fairness both to those who have become accustomed to purchasing font licenses at industry-average prices which under-value the work of living designers. Fairness also to us as creators of both a tool and intellectual property. Or of course to those who are just obtaining some entertainment value from the font.\n\nIn the case of Restraint, nowhere have we said that you absolutely can not use it as a principal design element or identity. What we have said is you can't necessarily do it for $45. No where have we said you absolutely can not modify it (or have it modified). We have simply requested you ask first and give us first refusal. And if any of the terms are unclear to you, you can exercise your fingers by sending us an email, although I realize that some find it easier to complain to the aether which isn't enabled to help them with their complaints. And for those that have a problem with the legality of the agreement, well then we will have to start charging a hell of a lot more to be able to hire a lawyer who can then write a nice long convoluted license agreement which no one will read and then we're back at square one.\n\nSo, given these issues, we welcome constructive, thoughtful feedback on how the license may be improved or clarified.\n\nPart of what I would like is to re-establish understanding between us and our (retail font) customer. The EULA is an agreement between us--a base contract which serves both you and us. Like most any contract, it is open to reasonable discussion; it is not a blind or brick wall, but a starting point. We have a limited, fair license fee and so therefore also have a limited, fair license. The fair use restrictions, which are unusual in the font world, are indications that if you intend to make obscene amounts of money off the basis of our work that we would like to be compensated. Likewise, if you ask 'can I use this for my puppet show?' under the basic license, chances are we will say yes. It is a pretty simple concept in the face of so many click-through agreements.\n\nIf someone ignores the intent of the license agreement that is on their conscience. We will either give them the opportunity to give us fair compensation or revoke their license. Or any number of other possibilities. We do not want to vet every instance of use. And as Marian says, if someone thinks they can't use it for a logo and decides not to buy it, I'm not going to sweat it for the loss of $45. If re-entering the retail font business becomes too onerous by virtue of those who find the terms unfair or intellectual property valueless or price too high etc., then I can do without it. I hope that won't be the case and that those who like and respect what I have to sell will continue to be served well by it.\n\n"

I am surprised that more foundries don’t take an approach like that. I guess it’s easier for stock photo resellers to pull this off than font foundries—piracy of their stuff is far less common and/or easy, and the big photo houses have the money to sue, which most type vendors don’t.

It's been in the works for several years, and Marian's star as an illustrator and lettering artist has risen greatly during that time. They could have opted not to release Restraint at all and Marian could stick with custom lettering projects which offer more lucrative compensation and less potential for headaches than single font sales accomplished over time.\n\nA reasoned argument or suggestion on clarification is helpful and leads to a positive dialog that informs and assists everyone in the type business and those who use type.

This is a small detail that Ross has set up for his own reasons.\n\n\\>if a font is designed to make “type art” it’s a bit silly to discourage it.\n\nNot even remotely. Make as much art with it as you want, just don't sell it for profit without negotiating compensation with me. With Restraint you can make fancy borders or shapes or headlines for magazines, brochures, company stationery, CDs, band posters galore. You can even make tiles for your own personal fireplace, but if you want to sell \"art\" that is actually my art, I deserve a cut in that.\n\nSome people here, and some people not here have looked, or will look at the EULA and say, No Way. Not only am I not concerned, I'm happy to have turned those people away. I really don't need their $45 that badly. For those who want to use it in good faith, have fun with it, and make some clients happy I say Hello and Welcome; I'd love to see what you make and how you found working with the font.\n\nI have to say, as a font it's piles of fun. Once you get the hang of the system, it's highly addictive. Myself, I'm still discovering the possibilities.\n\nBut hey, Check It Out! I made the top of the Hottest list on Typophile! Too bad it wasn't all slavish devotion, but the discussion has been interesting. I've always had a fascination with issues of copyright.\n\nOh and one last thing ... wouldn't it be cool if my EULA prompted future font buyers to actually notice and read their EULAs? Because I can tell you, right now they don't. The vast majority of people in the design community don't even know what a EULA is, even when you spell it out.\n\n-marian\n\n"

Or not. But irrespective of how it turns out in the end I respect Marian's right to try new models of Font licensing. Perhaps it will be a useful lesson to us. Hopefully we will pay attention not simply to the EULA itself but to the way the buyer experience is crafted.\\*\\*\n\n\\* That is of course why I suggested going well out of the usual way to point that out to a buyer before they buy.  \n\\*\\* If that sounds creepy then - tough.\n\n"

Anyone who licenses it will know that too. \"Hey we can't afford to have Marian do some work for us, let's just license the font and ask about extended licensing.\"\n\nMore and more type designers are having to decide how to charge for their work.

I once argued for a single EULA, but I know after doing more reading and delving deeper into this black art that it just isn't possible. Why? Because you cannot separate the typeface designer's perceived value from the actual value. They are one in the same. Font A will never be the same as Font B. Even Wedding Font A will never be the same as Wedding Font B. Foundries value and price their fonts differently. If the people shopping and licensing aren't saavy enough to understand the differences it isn't the foundries fault.\n\n"
