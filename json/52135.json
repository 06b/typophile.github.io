  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI've been designing a font for a while and it seems to be an on/off project. Mainly because I find more and more (wacky) ways of writing it, use it as a graphic element, etc. I'm a fan of optical illusions so I tried to get this font working as a hommage to Reutersvärd and Escher. Well, I managed to get quite a bit of impossible figures into it (it's most obvious in the B), though not in all of them. My focus was the outline of the characters, I tried to still make them legible even when not filled with the 'shading'.  \nI'm happy with it now and actually a bit proud to have managed to squeeze a font in the most restricting three dimensional grid possible.  \nEnjoy!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317205214im_/http:/typophile.com/files/stakk4web_4176.jpg)\n\n",

(They want me to sort it out...) To my knowledge, all fontdesign programs are adding the characters on a horizontal line. This font was initially made to write from top to bottom but playing with it, I found more and more interesting ways of displaying it.  \nI thought about writing a webapplication for it, but lack in skills. I would appreciate any ideas and/or technical hints that would help making the font available to the public.\n\n"

It needs to be done on a case-by case basis to make it legible. Another point is that any charakter is underneath the overlapping part of its predecessor. I don't know if fontdesign programs support layers (and are smart enough for the kerning).  \nAt the end of the day: Is it worth to go through all this pain? I guess noone would ever use it as copytext...\n\nIt's still good to design some mastheads or other products with it. Here are some skis I designed recently:  \n [http://www.kingswoodskis.com/home/skis-designs-klaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317205214/http:/www.kingswoodskis.com/home/skis-designs-klaus \"http://www.kingswoodskis.com/home/skis-designs-klaus\")\n\nP.S.: will post a picture later\n\n"

This happens if choosing the direction to write in a 30 degree angle upward direction meaning I have to set one letter behind each other, thus making it hard to follow. My intention was to provide a sort of a starting point to lead the viewer in in order to let him 'see' the font later. (unfortunately sacrificing readability)  \nHowever - if I start setting the font in a 30 degree downward direction it is way easier to recognise as such and readability increases. The characters still obscure each other but the mind seems to fill in the gaps. I'll post a sample if I find the time…\n\nCheers, Klaus\n\n"
