      "content": "The sp and ct ligatures in Deva feel very clunky to me, and fight against the elegance you seem to be aiming for. There's also a misspelling in the sample graphic on your blog. (The third 't' is missing from \"interpretation.\")\n\nI join others on this board in encouraging you to slow down a bit and pay more attention to the details of fit 'n' finish (and spelling).\n\n"
