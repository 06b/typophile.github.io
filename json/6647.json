There are fonts very similar, but I haven't found the same. Maybe it was a custom modification?   \n   \nThanks anyway.\n\n"

I think not much relation to present day fonts, which are much higher resolution.   \n   \nDo a search at MyFonts.com with the word 'Blackletter', and you will see many similar digitial fonts, of much higher quality.\n\n"
