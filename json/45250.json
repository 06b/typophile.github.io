Also would love here opinions on the pros cons of rubber/wood, and ink (think pads at staples) versus something perhaps more paint-ish.\n\nthanks much!\n\n [‹ Boomer font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063112/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45302 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Disadvantages to using Gill Sans in Wayfinding ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063112/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44995 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Is one easier to handle than the other?\n\nDoes a goofy/ornate handle improve stampage in any way?\n\n"
