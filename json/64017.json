And of course, where the design would look good and legible, not just weird. Traditionally the M is, as far as i know, always constructed with thin stroke first, followed by thick one, then thin again, etc.\n\n",

      "content": "I think this 'tradition' comes from baroque type design, as seen in typefaces like bodoni. These typefaces are based on geometry and drawing. Before that, the letters where based on the writing with a broad nipped pen. This means that both the 1st and the 4th stroke om the M have equal width.\n\nThat typeces which break your aforementioned tradition look weird to your eyes is in my view purely because we are not used to seeing them, not because they are illogical or counterintintuitive. That said: type design is a notoriously conservative discipline, so there might not be too many typefaces around that break these unwritten rules.\n\ngreetings Jeffrey  \n [infraordinaire](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417042625/http:/www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress)\n\n"

I've linked to the bold cuts because the contrast scheme is easier to see in them – it's not very strong, but the pattern is there.  \nBTW, sometimes (but not always) these same fonts also have a nontraditional contrast scheme on the \"N\" (with the diagonal being lighter than the stems).\n\nFWIW, for sans look at Bell Gothic/Centennial.\n\n"
