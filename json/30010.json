  "content": "Im starting some inital brainstorming on an Identity adjustment for an existing Archaelologist Consultancy based in Arizona and San Francisco.\n\nIm wondering if anyones got any typeface suggestions in terms of perhaps a sort of historic sort of initial arrangement for the company’s acronym “WSA” pairied with a modern and corporate lineale.\n\nIm also considering a series of marks for different aspects of the company and to be used primarily on the web.\n\nIf anyone actually give two expletives you can see the web site at [http://www.williamself.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070126001941/http:/www.williamself.com/)\n\nThe main design issue is that they are not really willing to spend the money to completely rebrand all at once. Their logo was cheaply built and works, but is generally disliked by the staff. However the new logo must sort of honor whats existed for the past 15 or so years. So to keep jabbering, its gotta find a way to phase in or look the same as what they currently have only it will contain a much more organized hierarchy and graphic standard.\n\nCheers and thanks for your time\n\n",
