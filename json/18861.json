  "content": "I know that alot of you are concerned about the quality of printed matter. I also know that some of you are Mac users. I just replaced my PC (more or less) with a 17” imac core duo. I couldn’t be happier, but for the printing.\n\nWhen I hunted for the print quality settings, such as “normal, better, best” etc., I couldn’t find them. I couldn’t even find settings to adjust the dpi. I installed Mac drivers for my HP Deskjet 5150 from the HP site, and this allowed me some more flexibility in terms of settings to tweak in the printer prefernces area. But only 300dpi printing. I noticed that I could choose some sort of GIMP-tuned driver as well from a drop-down list. I tried that (they’re all the same) and found I could now select 600dpi printing, but no 1200. In any case, when I print with these supposed highest settings, I can tell that my printer isn’t slow enough to be printing in high quality. And the output looks rather grainy. Correct me if I’m wrong, but when an inkjet prints in high quality it’s supposed to make several passes over the text. Mine does not seem to be doing that.\n\nAny help?\n\nThanks\n\n",
