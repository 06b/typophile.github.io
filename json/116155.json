But what's puzzling me is that the show was made in 1970s, and URW [say](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317152652/http:/www.urwpp.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/source/schnellsuche_e.htd?searchchar=artgothic) that ArtGothic was designed in 1995.\n\nSo I'm wondering if this is really another font, or if ArtGothic was based on an older font. It looks quite old in style...\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Art Gothic \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [donshottype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317152652/http:/typophile.com/user/205259 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-04-29 at 17.03.02.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317152652/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-04-29%20at%2017.03.02.png) | 510.24 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Your impression of old in style is correct. Art Gothic seems to have been originally produced by the Central Type Foundry of St. Louis, Missouri, in the 19th century. As is noted in the info provided with a digital version made by HiH [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/art-gothic-hih/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317152652/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/art-gothic-hih/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/art-gothic-hih/\") The reference to 1995 for the URW version refers to when it was digitized for URW.  \nDon\n\n"
