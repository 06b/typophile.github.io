  "content": "hi, guys.  \ni came across this poster and i’m wondering what your thoughts are. at first i was certain the type was Underground, but it doesn’t quite match the sample in myfonts. perhaps a more original version? i was also curious if anyone would venture a guess on date. i’m fairly confident it’s from the 30s, but if anyone had more specific info, i would appreciate it.\n\nthanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907164313im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Underground_6329.jpg)\n\n [‹ THE ACADEMY IS...

Most in this style are actaully from the 1920s but this could be ’30s especially as London Zoo’s fantastic art-deco penguin pool was opened in ’34.\n\nYes, it is hand lettering but based on Edward Johnston’s Underground typeface. [wikipedia info](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907164313/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_(typeface))\n\n[P22 do various weights.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907164313/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=p22+underground)  \nThey’d need a bit of tweaking to look more like this particular poster. The crossed W is an alternate in them. The M in that poster is slightly flared, more like Futura.\n\n"
