In fact, I don't give a flying  through a ring donut whether trapping is a real phenomena, or a fantasy.   \nWhat is blindingly obvious though, is the connection between the previous debate and Hrant's image. In the previous debate you refuted the idea of ink trapping by (among other things) suggesting that the pantograph was not capable of cutting the sharp details required by Hrant's trapping theory. The caption on the new picture from Hrant shows that the fine detail was not in the hands of the pantograph operators, but was left to hand-cutters.   \nIf you can't see the connection then you are either being deliberately stupid, or you are...well...just stupid.\n\n"

Would you rather have your type cut by an expert hand punchcutter, or by an expert Benton Pantograph punch cutter?_   \n   \nAn expert hand punchcutter.   \n   \n2.) And why?   \n   \nFirst of all let me say that this has absolutely nothing to do with ink trapping or whether the pantograph can get a sharp inside corner or not. I would prefer to have a punchcutter cut my type by hand because it would remove several stages of the industrial manufacturing process: no precise and scaled drawings, no card patterns, no brass patterns. The pantograph is an industrial tool that enables a technician to reproduce as a punch a design by a type designer; this is not to say that the technician is without skill or that operating a pantograph is easy, but it is something that large numbers of people were successfully trained to do. In order for those people to be able to do their work, type designers and/or drawing offices had to produce precisely drafted outline drawings of type at large sizes, from which patterns could be derived. Meanwhile, the hand punchcutter can sit down with just the designer's rough-and-ready drawings at any size and produce a typeface. I admire the directness of this process, and the non-division of labour it implies.\n\n"

You may have noticed I am kinder than you on this punchcutting room. But that error would never have passed inspection at Lanston, or Monotype or either of the Linotypes.   \n   \nThis same punchcutting room repeated the same error in a different point size. \"That sir, is most strange.\"   \n   \nAnd I am not convinced, as the picture is poor, that the galley nearest is one of punches, it could be just type!   \n   \nMaybe you could send me a clearer picture!   \n   \n.0001   \n   \nGerald Giampa   \nLanston Type Company\n\n"

Even people like JvK have trusted the master punchcutter.   \n   \nBut the rub is that it's too rarified/slow/expensive, and we'll very rarely get what we \"want\". So what's a good balance between having the pantograph cut all the sizes from one set of exact drawings versus pure handcutting? For one thing, some characters in some faces can be mathematically derived to satisfation (like the \"n\") while others (like the \"s\") can't, at least not without some amazing algorithm. So to me a selective use of the pantograph with subsequent/parallel handcutting is a realistic ideal.   \n   \nIn this scenario, handcutting can be used to sharpen corners (and add traps), since the pantograph was unable.   \n   \nNote also that ATF used to have complex methods of automatically scaling master drawings to different sizes, to great satisfaction, thanks to the mysterious Benton \"cutting slips\"...   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

If I may though....   \n   \nIn regard to your statement \"Remember that Arion Press and Pennyroyal Press and most of the fine presses of the UK use Monotype. Nobody could exist if they had to have Stempel type.\" The recent Pennyroyal Press Bible and many of the Arion Press books are done with photopolymer and, while the UK is somewhat of a holdout, many of the fine presses there are now turning to photopolymer, as have many in the US and elsewhere. The reason is as you stated. Nobody could exist if they had to have Stempel type... but today that would also include Monotype. I could not survive as a letterpress printer without photopolymer. The economics of metal, which includes the labor factor, are quite difficult to work with.   \n   \nI don't have a problem with metal, I still have tons of it, but I can't afford to stay in business if that is all I have. Since my concerns are primarily typographic (mainly book typography), I will readily admit I am enamored with, and thankful for, the opportunities the digital era has brought with it.

That their punch cutting departments monumental task of manipulating typefaces with great sensitivity should be admired.   \n   \nI say that knowing that all typefaces are not equal.

Unfortunately my books are in Vancouver or I would show for you an example. But, I think it would not be hard to find that example of Linotype Caslon Oldstyle. There is dangers in saying much bad about it, because I could surprise you with something. The \"Caslon Challenge\" was not my idea.   \n   \nThe difficulty in mechanical typesetting was no easy feat and that many fortunes were lost trying to make typesetting quicker.

It also had the constraint of being unable to perform any kerning.   \n   \nMonotype had the constraint of a unit-width system. I am not as familiar with Monotype's matrix grid, so I may not have a grasp of all the details, but: due to the arrangement of the grid, I believe, certain characters were required to have the same unit value. This was the source of the 18-unit system, although it's unclear to me whether all Monotype models conformed to the same system. I think there were a few different configurations developed. See McGrew, page 294, for a diagram of one such arrangement.   \n   \nSo, in creating Sabon, Tschichold had to contend with both the Monotype unit system and the Linotype duplexing and nonkerning.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

I would provide a bio of his credentials, however I feel that his reputation is well enough known for his work at Linotype. Parker and Mat Carter were both founders of Bitstream, presently Parker is working as a consultant to the Font Bureau.   \n   \nGraciously Mike sent me this material because I asked him to clarify the Linotype unit system. Also I have a note in uppercase which is not his words. The text is in its entirety with the exception of materials at the end which were edited because they do not pertain to the Linotype question but are personal arrangements for the two of us to meet.   \n   \n\"Dear Gerald,   \n  \nNormal Linotype matrices were machined to the appropriate width of the pair of characters to be placed one above the other on the matrix,typically:   \nroman & bold roman 'a' for 10 point Excelsior with Bold, roman & italic 'a' for 10 point Excelsior with Italic, or bold roman & bold italic 'a' for Excelsior Bold with Bold Italic.   \n   \nTo obtain the normal character the matrix sat on normal alignment. To obtain the auxiliary character the matrix was raised a fixed amount, placing the auxiliary character opposite the mold, correctly   \naligned.   \n  \nThe Linotype problem in preparing each character was to design the roman, italic, bold and bold italic versions to all fit on on the same width (without, of course, permitting any character to kern off the matrix).\" (NOTE,GERALD GIAMPA: LINOTYPE FIT WAS SLIGHTLY WIDER BECAUSE OF MATRIX CONTSTRUCTION.)   \n  \n'During the nineteen forties Teletype driven Linotype machines came into existence. The idea was to replace linotype operators with faster tape drives. In order to justify lines predictably, each character had to have a predictable width. Fairchild established a standard width for each character expressed in a single fixed set of eighteen units to the set width em to be used for all typefaces regardless of typeface design. The wider the column width, the larger the eighteen unit set width required.   \n  \nThe Associated Press and United Press International distributed their stories in printed form accompanied by punched paper tape containing codes for characters, word spaces, and line endings. You would hang the tape on a teletypesetter-equipped linecaster.   \n   \nSlugs would emerge at a great pace as long as the machine was equipped with a TTS font with characters cut to the appropriate TTS set widths for the column width.   \n  \nBy the 1960s the most popular newstext font had become 9 point 8 set Corona with Boldface No. 2. The most popular classified font was 5 1/2 point 6 set Spartan Book with Heavy. These two fonts were produced in huge volume, along with others like them, perhaps leading some folk to wrongly believe that all Linotype fonts were cut to the eighteen unit system.   \n   \nMike Parker\"\n\n"
