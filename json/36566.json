From my count, Typophile might possibly be the last bastion of civility on the Internet. That takes a lot of will-power, people. Of course our record isn’t exactly spotless, but we do make attempts at keeping a pretty clear head before running the mouth off because of personal tastes or disagreements.\n\nOpinions and ideas are exchanged freely and without persecution or prejudice here and that’s a marvel in this age. Granted, there aren’t many heated debates that end in fisticuffs when related to typography.\n\nSo, I wanted to take a moment and thank everyone for being intelligent, patient and making Typophile a beautiful place to share thoughts and ideas without (too many) worries. It’s what keeps me coming back .\n\nBravo.\n\n [‹ What Happened to Kabel Regular?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202191523/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36576 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Remarkable ‘value’ for money ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202191523/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36591 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Typophile has the advantage of being actively threaded, so you can avoid the contentious threads if you’re not feeling that way inclined on a particular day, harder to ignore when the stuff floods your inbox.\n\n"

(shining example right here) I do find it disappointing when people resort to insults and bias but the worst thing that happens here is condescension. Typophile is for many kinds of people with different skill levels and educational and economic backgrounds. We need to keep this in mind when we see posts that have naive questions. Also, if there is something that another person is saying that is creating disagreement - ’attack’ the issue not the person.\n\nI encourage those that have had a bad experience here to keep on posting and asking questions. Ignore the bad (people) and keep on learning.\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"

Even I’ve had moments when I thought, is this guy serious? Then, I’d refrain from posting what I really thought of the 5 minutes I wasted reading their request and just answered the damned question. On other sites, I might not have been as patient or understanding. Typophile definitely has a calmer, gentler social community.\n\n"
