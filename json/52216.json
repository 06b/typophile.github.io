  "content": "Hi, i'm new to the site, and to graphic design & typoghraphy.\n\nI'm currently designing a four page brochure in indesign. The client has informed me that the printer used will be a 'xerox hard ink phaser'.\n\nI am presuming that the colour set-up should be rgb for this printer? Can anyone confirm this?\n\nAlso, this piece doesn't use any photos, but does use artwork that i have created in illustrator and brought over to indesign. Does this mean that dpi is not an issue? If it is then what dpi should my illustrator images be set to?\n\nThanks for any help and please excuse my newbie-ignorance.  \nJonny\n\n",

Virtually every desktop printer also works internally with CMYK. However, because the printer mnf know most people cannot be bothered to learn color conversion (and use Word, which only _has_ an RGB mode), the internal RIP is actually optimized for its own RGB-to-CMYK conversion. That depends on a lot of things, such as ink color (inks are never a pure color) and ink density. I have seen in practice that printing an image directly from Photoshop in CMYK mode gave a poorer result than the same image in RGB mode. That's just because the printer internal conversion is better than Photoshop's.\n\nPerhaps you should just try, and bet on RGB first, as that probably comes out better than CMYK.\n\n"
