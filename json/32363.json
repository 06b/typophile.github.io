  "content": "I'm typesetting my (philosophy) dissertation in Adobe Jenson, and I need to use a few lowercase Greek letters (probably only phi and psi). Could someone please recommend a typeface with Greek lowercase letters that will look good alongside Adobe Jenson?\n\nThe closest I have access to are Minion Pro and the free Garamond Premier Pro that came with my copy of InDesign. Here's what they look like alongside Adobe Jenson:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111225033950im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Greek%20Test_4211.jpg)\n\nI used Greek phi's from Minion on the top line and from Garamond Premier on the bottom line. The second phi on each line is set in italics; I can't decide whether I prefer it that way.\n\nMinion's x-height is significantly larger than Jenson's, so I had to shrink the Minion phi's to 11.2 pt (against 12 pt Jenson). That made them too thin, though, so I switched to the Caption optical size. For Garamond Premier, the first phi is just the Regular optical size at 12 pt. The italic phi at the end of the line is from the Caption font, reduced to 11.4 pt.\n\nWhich of these four phi's does everyone prefer? Any other suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nMatty\n\n",
