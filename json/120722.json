  "content": "Greetings everyone. Love some advice on type treatments for price lockups that look elegant on screen. Have a client who employs Helvetica Neue (licensed) as it's corporate type face and I'm struggling to create an elegant system for displaying potentially verbose number amounts. Example: $329.87 looks fine small but at larger sizes gets clunky. Any thoughts or comments appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Satellite\\_Card\\_Lrg.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317130815/http:/typophile.com/files/Satellite_Card_Lrg.png) | 6.31 KB |\n\n",
