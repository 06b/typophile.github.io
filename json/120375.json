Could be bespoke and exclusive for the brand. Reminds me of [Petala](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075435/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typefolio/petala-pro). Pro version has a single storey / [a](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075435/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typefolio/petala-pro/bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/593980/306) and / [g](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075435/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typefolio/petala-pro/bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/593980/286) available as alternates though OpenType features which should get you pretty close (only remaining top small spike). Other option, out-of-thebox but less close to me: [Flex](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075435/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/flex_bold_monday) (backslanting italic /a and /g)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415075435im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_4329.png)\n\n"
