  "content": "A client of mine uses TF Arrow as an identity font. They have a version purchased in 2000 that has no italics or small caps. Also, it is REALLY tightly spaced and dies at small sizes. Is Tracy faces still around? I am trying to contact them for EULA info about modification and to see if they have extended the family by now (or if they would let me do a set of small caps). I can’t find them. Anybody know if they live? or if the name is spelled wrong?\n\nChris\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080414234116im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tfarrow_4705.png)\n\n [‹ Jack Daniels Package](http://web.archive.org/web/20080414234116/http:/typophile.com/node/30813 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Foti Cleaning Services fancy script - Polonaise ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080414234116/http:/typophile.com/node/30902 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
