  "content": "I'm designing a serif typeface, and I'm wondering what's the acceptable amount of latinization for the mu (µ) glyph? I'm talking about the µ in the Latin-1 Supplement block—the one used for typesetting \"µm\" & stuff, not the mu in the actual Greek block. Most fonts I've seen do the same for both glyphs, with no serifs, a curved spur and a blob at the bottom of the stem. But I don't know how well that blends when set next to a latin 'm'. I've seen many fonts where the microns just looked horrible. I guess the same issue comes up with the IPA lambda and phi.\n\nIs the following design acceptable?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417123054im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screenshot%20034_5306.png)\n\nAlso how would you deal with the black spot at the intersection of the 'µ's bowl and the stem?\n\n",
