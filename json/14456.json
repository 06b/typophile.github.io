The best part about these fonts is that they come with a little application that links all the letters correctly—kinda like OpenType, but this little app can run within MS Word. My mom prints out all her kids’ names each year and puts them at the top of their desks so that they can see how to write it out in cursive properly. I higly recommend these fonts.\n\n"
