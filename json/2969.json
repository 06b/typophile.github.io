Though the reason I used it -- that if anything the identifier would be that straight middle on the S -- was undercut by the fact that I was looking for the wrong glyph. In the end, neither the upper- or lower-case s had anything to do with the id. So I got extremely lucky.   \n   \nBy the way, given my responses to Identifont's questions, Coquette came up as a better match than Luther. Thought you'd like to know.\n\n"

Identifont's data base is an eclectic selection (to put it nicely), and some choices are rather subjective calls, even if you have the whole font in front of you, which is rare for ID'ing.   \n   \nI'm not trying to suggest that maybe the database is skewed towards affiliates/sponsors ... well, yes I am!\n\n"
