It's a logo from a coffeecompany, but I don't know if the logo is handmade or it is a real font.   \nIf it's handmade maybe I would make a font out of it. I like it.   \n   \n ![Blanche Dael](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124311im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28978.gif)   \n   \nThanx,   \n�en�\n\n",

Leslie Cabarga has done a number of these connected 'machined' scripts, but Nick Curtis's [\"Lakeshore Drive\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124311/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg5.html) is the closest I know to this style. You can see the others I've collected, in that section of the Script Guide.\n\n"
