  "content": "Hi everyone.\n\nI am new in the typography world, so I'm still learning new stuff.\n\nI started creating Arabic font and I need all knowledge you are willing to share :)\n\nI created design for each letter in every form and imported them in Fontlab Studio 5.1.  \nI still need to define final, initial and medial form through OpenType features (and ofcourse mark positioning).  \nI don't know what to type, what code, so if you know some good 'instructions' for this please let me know :)\n\nAleksandra\n\n",

      "content": "Hi  \nDefining the features and lookups is a very technical and time-consuming job.  \nAs far as I know the only free example for VOLT was made by SIL for Sheherazade font - but it did not work for me, and I had to ask an Arab professional.  \nThere is an excellent booklet pdf that may be helpful to you:  \n [http://www.khtt.net/page/31753/en](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114152/http:/www.khtt.net/page/31753/en \"http://www.khtt.net/page/31753/en\")  \nI think you have to join [http://www.khtt.net/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114152/http:/www.khtt.net/ \"http://www.khtt.net/\") to access this.  \nGood luck  \nVladimir\n\n"
