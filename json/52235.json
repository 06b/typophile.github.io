The logo is one day old and I was maybe too hasty in posting it in this forum but I do appreciate all your feedback.  \nLet me add this in defense of a not-overly-stylized (“snack-y”) solution: the logo is intended for corporate audience (the Lufthansas, Frito-Lays and Wrigleys of the world); the snacks that are passed around on the plane will naturally carry their own visual branding.\n\n"
