  "content": "While working on my Joy Division Closer font (see [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212054/http:/typophile.com/node/41650)), it was suggested that I support Cyrillic and Greek letters in addition to the Latin.\n\nSeems simple enough, pop in the right encoding, add the characters that are missing because Hey Cool! Half of the letters are the same as in Latin!, and voilá, Greek and Cyrillic, just like that.\n\nBut in reading the [Greek All Caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212054/http:/typophile.com/node/15982) thread and the [Greek](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212054/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Greek) Wiki it appears that it's not that simple.\n\nFirst of all, is there any precedent in a Roman inscriptional style upper case Greek, either an actual inscription or a font? I know that there was inscribed Greek, that's not what I'm talking about. But more like a TRAJAN-LIKE IMPERIAL inscription. Something grand and imposing. Something like the Romans would have done had the Romans done Greek.\n\nSecond, if I continue with this foolish errand, is it necessary to add all of accented character feature coding if there is no lower case to convert from? I'm guessing that there would still be some contextual programming involved.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Pre-Rome, the Greeks themselves did not carve large monumental inscriptions… their stone-carved text was very small and to the point. While these letters were often beautiful, they do not stylistically align with the Trajan Column's letters.\n\nIn their Empire, the Romans did in fact carve large monumental inscriptions in Greek, at least on occasion. If a Greek would find these letters Greek enough is not for me to say.\n\nAnd now I'm gong to speculate, with no feet standing in the realm of my own factual knowledge: Perhaps the Byzantines, who were not Romans at all even though they regularly called themselves as such, made some monumental lettering. They did think that they were good Romans after all, and it was the Romans who did that sort of thing. Except that the Byzantines (at least after a certain point) spoke Greek instead of Latin. So…\n\nAs for Cyrillic, after the second World War, the Russians did carve a lot of imposing monumental Trajan-like lettering. I mean, why wouldn't they? I bet you would, too, if you had been them. Moreover, their client-state artists did as well… so East Berlin, for example, has some odd stuff. I bet that Poland and Hungary do, too.\n\n"

      "content": "There isn't an absolute distinction between Romans and Greeks - by the second century CE, and even more so in the third, it's probably fairer to say that some Romans wrote natively in Latin and some Romans wrote natively in Greek. Or that in the third century BCE very few Greeks were Romans, whereas in the third century CE most Greeks were Romans. The biggest and most monumental of inscriptions tended to be in Latin, because that was the official state language, but even imperial inscriptions were often in Greek in the Greek-speaking provinces.\n\nSo Greek inscriptions of the Roman period are Roman, but they're also Greek at the same time, and entirely a part of the Greek cultural tradition. For this reason, in fact, the exact style of monumental capitals used in Latin, like on Trajan's Column, isn't found much in Greek lettering of the same period; in general, the Greek lettering style tended to be somewhat more square, and the serifs are treated differently (often more angular). But the elements of the Latin monumental style were derived from Hellenistic Greek inscriptions, so it's all related. Byzantine inscriptions have a quite different style, looking \"medieval\" rather than \"Roman\" (think Russian icons, for example).\n\nTo get back to the original question, yes there were grand and imposing monumental Greek capitals, especially in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. No, they do not look exactly like Trajanic lettering, but they are culturally related and thus similar in various ways. You can see a ton of examples, big and small, of various periods, at the [Aphrodisias inscriptions site](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212054/http:/www.insaph.kcl.ac.uk/index.html).\n\nHow all of this is perceived by modern Greeks is another question entirely, and one I wouldn't know the answer to.\n\n"

Historically, one finds smallcaps with and without accents, so there is a matter of preference, which recommends a mechanism by which the user can choose to display accents on smallcaps. So Adobe is, like other developers, using the feature to contextually supress the display of smallcap accents, allowing the user to turn off this feature if they decide they want to see the accents. Now Adobe have a policy of providing one-to-one glyph name to character mapping, so that if Acrobat needs to reconstruct text strings from raw glyph IDs it can do so accurately. This means, among other things, that they include e.g. /A.sc/ and /a.sc/ as smallcap variants: duplicate glyphs with different names for use with different layout features. The Greek smallcap glyphs with and without accents are another instance of the same policy, i.e. a smallcap Alpha with no visible accent or breathing mark may still need to be mapped back to a diacritic character, not to a plain Alpha.\n\n"

      "content": "Is it worth noticing what the little bilingual inscription is telling us? The Latin text, using lowercase, is _Tituli heic ordinantur et sculpuntur aidibus sacreis cum operum publicorum_. Books on inscriptions do not insult their readers by giving translations from Latin. At any rate I have not seen one for this inscription, although we are told that it is bad Latin (and Greek). So here is my very cautious attempt: ‘Inscriptions are prepared and cut here for sacred and public buildings’.\n\nSome of the words are easy. _Titulus_ is a common word for an inscription. _Sculpere_ means ‘cut’. But what about _ordinare_? Does it mean ‘we write the words’, or ‘we put the words in order and choose the letterforms’? Is it the earliest advertisement for a specialist in the layout of texts? And does the Greek help us with _ordinare_?\n\nThe frustrating thing is that books on Latin inscriptions, like Giancarlo Susini’s _The Roman stonecutter_ (English edition 1973) talk about the text without showing the inscription. The only picture of it that I know is a pale halftone in a good little book in Italian, Ida Calabi Limentani, _Epigrafia Latina_. (I have the edition of 1983.) She mentions another advertisement in the Vatican and suggests that it is probably for memorial inscriptions: _Titulos scribendos vel si quid marmorari opus fuerit, his habes._ Something like ‘You can have inscriptions written here and cut by our workmen’?\n\nThe image of the Palermo stone in the post is the best I have seen.

The sole ones to retain are for the vowels with dialytika (diaeresis). Would polytonic or monotonic alter that? Not one whit. Of course an absent accent means one can't rightly tell, without context, whether \"ΜΑΛΑΚΑ!\" was to mean \"μαλακά!\" (softly!) or \"μαλάκα!\" (wanker!), but that's another matter.\n\nFrankly, I've never seen Greek set in smallcaps _with_ accents apart from some ugsome adverts produced for the Greek market by a foreign firm. But I've seen (and set) plenty of smallcap Greek _without_ accents, quite independent of whether the text was Katharevousa (Purist), Archaic, Koine, or contemporary Demotiki.\n\nIf this sounds dismissive of the \"two-option model,\" well, yes, I guess it is. Just can't see the point of it, since one can either read the text or not.

I was one of the people from whom Adobe sought advice, and while the discussion was lively it wasn't really contradictory. Most of it resolved around the best way to implement the historically observable options\\*; there wasn't a lot of disagreement about the need to support those options. I think at several points in the discussion Adobe were on the point of giving up on the whole idea of polytonic smallcaps, as they realised the amount of work involved in getting the casing rules implemented correctly. Its a testament to their commitment to quality typography that they stayed the course and that Arno is as good as it is.\n\n\\* Or at least, the major options. Once one starts looking at the full range of Greek typography, one encounters all sorts of strange practices that are well beyond what became the (relatively) standard norms of polytonic setting, e.g. accents after letters instead of before them.\n\n_A little off-topic, but should “correct” fonts now include two sets of small cap glyphs? — one for substitutions from caps, one from lower case?_\n\nYou mean in the general sense, i.e. not Greek-specific? Adobe obviously want to encourage it, but I don't think they would use the term 'correct'. They recognise that it is a choice that depends on how much effort one wants to make in supporting Acrobat text reconstruction. Given than more and more PDFs are being produced using software that embeds the original character string in the document, the need for such text reconstruction is in decline, but it is still common enough to be a serious issue. Generally, I do not bother, but I always ask my clients how important it is to them that PDFs created from print streams, with raw GIDs instead of character codes, be accurately searchable. So far, other than Adobe, only one client has wanted to pay the extra money for this functionality in their fonts.\n\nRCC: _Frankly, I’ve never seen Greek set in smallcaps with accents apart from some ugsome adverts produced for the Greek market by a foreign firm._\n\nOne sees smallcaps with accents in renaissance Greek printing (i.e. outside of Greece but typically with the involvement of emigré Greeks); indeed, it seems to have been the norm, with smallcaps apprently being treated as a variant of lowercase text rather than a form of all-caps.\n\nIn this, as in other aspects of Greek typography (e.g. the 'prosgegrammeni' vs ypogegrammeni contention for uppercase letters with mute iota) the issues are complicated by the independent traditions of typography for classical and Biblical scholarship outside of Greece. These traditions are not only independent of the Greek tradition, they are also independent of each other: German conventions differ from French conventions which differ from British conventions.\n\n"

Note the petite adscript mute iota. The scan is of the beautiful collotype reproduction in the original edition of Scholderer's _Greek Printing Types._ Where smallcaps are used for a body of text, as here, accentuation is probably more important than it would be in a title or other short use of smallcaps.\n\nI have a theory, which I would need to test against more samples, that the distinction between accenting smallcaps or not depends on whether the smallcaps are understood to represent lowercase/mixedcase text or all-cap text. In Latin script typography, we use smallcaps sometimes to represent lowercase letters, e.g. as a stylistic device in the first line of a chapter, and sometimes to represent uppercase letters, as in abbreviations such as UNESCO, but there is no visual distinction between the two. Renaissance typographers found that they could maintain a distinction between Greek smallcaps as variants of lowercase and Greek smallcaps as variants of all-caps by including or excluding accents. I don't know how consistent this use was, how widespread, or how long it persisted.\n\nHere is another example of Greek cap forms with accents from the Estienne edition of Isokrates of 1593.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212054im_/http:/typophile.com/files/EstiennesIsokratesCaps_6145.jpg)\n\nThis is interesting because the title has the accents dropped, but the subhead has the accents. Although the capital letters in the subhead are technically not smallcaps, i.e. they are full size caps from an intermediate size of type, they are being treated as if there were smallcaps, which to this publisher at least means putting accents on them. But the typesetter has a problem, because accents on smallcaps go above the letter, not before the letter as in regular capitals, but he is using full size capitals from a different font so does not have sorts with accents above caps. So he has to insert the accents after the letters.\n\n"

Perhaps he made the distinction that small caps deserved their own style of accenting, so it didn't look like wannabe lower case, and so that it didn't take up too much vertical space (given that small caps are taller than \"kappa\" height.) And he came up with the \"somewhat after and somewhat above\" style. Note the different treatment of Omicron Varia and Omicron Oxia.\n\n"

He's able to raise and slightly offset the marks over some letters, probably with the help of a file, using mark sorts that were designed to go over lowercase letters. Have you read the analysis of Aldine Greek printing in Peter Burnhill's _Type spaces_? The lengths that renaissance Greek printers went to is extraordinary.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you, John. The images are interesting indeed.\n\nIn the \"Isocrates\" example above, capitalization is all over the map: Δημόνικον set partly in caps and the remainder in lowercase because of a syllable break (ΔΗΜΟΝΙκον — egad!) and Παραινεσεις capitalized in one spot, but the declined παραινεσεως not so a few lines lower. This is truly wild stuff. Doubt an authentic \"pattern\" emerges apart from your comment \"the typesetter was making do as best as he could with what was in his type case.\" Nevertheless, it's fascinating.\n\nYet an unstated question hangs: Though examples from a relatively distant past document such small-cap usage, is there today a good rationale for maintaining what some might view as little more than a curiosity? (More baldly stated: Do you see a genuine market for this? The extra work entailed isn't _that_ hard, but would it likely ever be used?)\n\nThanks again. Love those ligatures.\n\n"

I'm genuinely curious whether anyone is using these forms today for anything short of (potentially) pseudo-authentic reproductions. Would it be, in other words, merely a question of \"perceived value\" — cranking up the overall kilobyte weight by including scads of glyphs no one will likely ever access — or is there a bona fide contemporary need and usage?\n\nI'm decidedly in favor of offering extensive choices to users, mind you, but where, in the case present, is the tipping point at which one's merely adding something that's tantamount to an alien-faced alternate smiley, if you get my drift?\n\n"

It's merely an older form of Pi and, in the example shown, is more \"decorative\" than anything else. One might suppose, at first blush, that it was selected as an initial cap (for instance in ΠΡΟC) but it's also been used in ΥΠΟΘΕΣΙΣ. Rather disorderly — if not to say devoid of apparent logic.

The extra work entailed isn’t that hard, but would it likely ever be used?)_\n\nI don't know. One of the reasons I recommend the 'calt' feature approach is that it means the accents are suppressed by default: a user has to take an action in order to display them (and in some applications this isn't even an option, since they don't provide a UI mechanism to turn off the 'calt' feature). My take on this is that the range of conventions of typesetting Greek is so wide and varied that providing for options is a good idea. I know that I tend to look further back than some people when considering what those options might be -- Yannis Haralambous was surprised, I think, by some of the older material I showed him --; I like being able to say 'Look, this thing was possible once, and now it's possible again'. I'd rather people have the option and decide not to use it than not to give them the option.\n\n"

That is, why not have default smallcap and caps-to-smallcaps behavior for Greek, both mono- and polytonic, without accents (dialytika excepted) and then optionally apply accents to all these smallcaps via a stylistic set? If additional and/or optional typographic \"niceties\" are deemed requisite for said accented smallcap ranges, such could then be applied via a second stylistic set, right? So doing would appear to fulfill your criteria: accents suppressed by default, requiring users to actively choose to display them.\n\nIn fact, this approach seems so straightforward that I wonder why \"contextual alternates\" was chosen as the feature route to follow rather than \"stylistic sets.\" Issues of application UI support, perhaps? Less point-and-click maybe? What am I failing to notice on this count?\n\nThe matter appears to turn more on \"stylistic\" (at least by historic period) rather than \"contextual\" distinctions, but there may well be a Procrustean coding rationale at work in the shadows too. Please explain. Thank you.\n\n"

      "content": "If you use the stylistic sets approach, then you are obliged to include a full set of Greek diacritic character smallcap variants with accents and a full set without accents. If you are following Adobe's approach on supporting Acrobat text reconstruction, then you are already including such sets, but if you are taking a more efficient approach to glyph set size and avoiding duplicate glyphs, then using 'calt' makes more sense. Also, the handling of the dialytika needs to be contextual, e.g. άι needs to be replaced by ΑΪ, and should be linked to whether or not the other accents are displayed, so it makes sense to include these contextual lookups in a contextual layout feature, rather than in a stylistic variants feature.\n\nA further thought regarding use of accented smallcaps: in the Laurentian edition of Apollonius Rhodius, smallcaps are used for the main body of text, and obviously one wants the reader to be able to read such text with ease, and not be concerned about possible ambiguities introduced by the absence of accents. Even if modern typographers choose to suppress accents in typical smallcap use, there may still be circumstances in which they would find it linguistically helpful to display them, perhaps even for individual words within otherwise unaccented text, in order to avoid ambiguity. Your 'wanker' example above might be just such a circumstance.\n\n"
