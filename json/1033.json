That in turn was 'borrowed' by SSi for something they called \"Daniela\" (see sample of El Greco and Calligraphy at [http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script02Pg1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109092935/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script02Pg1.html)). You might be able to use Fontseek to locate a copy of Daniela at a free site.\n\n"
