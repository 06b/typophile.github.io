Is there a few must visit websites you visit each week that does a round up of the week/months releases etc?\n\nI’d love to be able to go to one or two website each week, or be email once or twice a week with the latest releases without having to go and visit every font designers website etc.\n\nAny help would be great\n\n",

Also, once a year we cover the best releases at [Typographica](http://web.archive.org/web/20091012074035/http:/typographica.org/) and I’ll be posting more frequent reviews soon.\n\nJames, I think Raptor was using the word “shop” figuratively. He’s looking for a news source, not necessarily a store. Still, one of the many services resellers provide is exactly this, introducing buyers to goods they wouldn’t otherwise find.\n\n"
