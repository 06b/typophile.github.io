The size ratio change is a good thing, but don't you think something in between would look better?   \nAlso, the design for \"v\" interferes with the instant recognition of the letter, thus making the name itself hard to read. out of all there, the first one is neat and has far more potential to be made into a corporate mark.   \n   \nGeorge\n\n"

Have you come up with any new ideas?   \n   \nI also don't see the necessity of a redesign. Maybe you could add a more natural typeface to it and create a more elegant whitespace flow inside the box...I'd think about how the white-space \"thread\" flows inside the green box. It's too mechanical in yours, which is the problem I see with the original. That \"thread\" (white space in the box, whatever it's supposed to be, I think of a piece of thread for sewing) could flow into and out from the box better. If it's supposed to be a \"V\" then you can make it better.   \n   \nThe type you have makes me think I'm about to walk into a state-of-the-art Oxygen bar or something.

Even straight patterns in textiles have curves once you look up close.   \n   \nI would suggest that you do something to make this feel more human or fabric like. Not so vertical, horizontal, or straight. Make it flow. Push a more freeform, flowing direction, then if necessary, bring in some more gridded design to control the potential chaos.

Some of the illustrations in the link below might help loosen you up a bit, but notice how alot of them maintain a controlled grid combined with free flowing forms.   \n   \n [http://www.chapter3.net/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142245/http:/www.chapter3.net/)   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

It is kind of strange that I haven't seen such an obvious solution. Velana's brand is quite known here in Slovenia, so I think I wasn't able to look at it from the proper distance.   \n   \nSo this is a solution with a more organic flow of the \"curtain\".

I think this kind of lettering reaks of present trends: a monoline where the v=n e=a etc. It does so in the same way that photolettering smells of the 1970s and now looks dated. So be careful with this approach.   \n   \nOne way to distance yourself from this problem might be to use more traditional forms, but keeping the monoline (eg Foundry Monoline). Or you could try a fresh take on an established genre (a neo grotesque, or humanist sans, or a semiserif). How about some of Storm's offerings: Teuton, Sebastian, John Sans, or Dyna Grotesque? Maybe contact Christain Robertson about using Pill Gothic! There's an idea. Good luck!   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

There's still a lot there in the old Velana logo. It just looks a bit stuffy, IMO.   \n   \nI think the type should stay close to its original (in terms of the typeface), and maybe even a similar orientation of mark to type, particularly because it's quite known in Slovenia. Plus, if you keep the same rough proportions, it can be used in ways similar to the old logo. Don't be too eager to violate the brand equity. I do like your tweaking of the logo in the A examples. The B example looks nice, but starts to lose the 'V' quality of the old mark. The dip seems too shallow to me, if you're going to make the curves more exaggerated.   \n   \nBe sure to emphasize to your clients the difference between 'new and fresh', and 'disposable'.\n\n"
