      "content": "Thanks for the critiques. Here is a few of the reasons for the selected choices. The blue is representative of the Mediterranean sea and the colors of the Greek flag. I am designing for contrast, as signage is outdoors and establishment is open till' 2am daily. Lettering used on signage are reflective, as to be more visible at night. Colors are very limited when using reflective, so   \nchoices came down to yellow, white, silver and red. Background colors could not be \"warm\" colors, ie tans, beige, soft greens or blues as reflective materials are not available in these colors. Best match for background colors came down to complementary colors that would match reflective colors. Blue was the choice.   \n   \nI designed a Sans Serif face to match the body type of Harmony. The suggestion of using Jeremy Tankard's \"Sophia\" was a good suggestion, in fact an inspiration for my \"E\" design.   \n   \nI am surprised at how little commentators like the forks. I guess   \nI thought it was clever.They were intended to be more decorative   \nthan iconographic.   \n   \nBesides the post I uploaded yesterday there are other elements   \nto consider. Here are a few more. ![harmony typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108203855im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26255.jpg)\n\n"

But before moving to the signage (which I agree is busy), i want to voice some concern about the execution of MED MIX. It looks to me like it has a light/shadow chisel thing happening. That is nice, though it looks a little inconsistent with where the light would be if it was actually chisled. Check the widths of the white areas too for consistency (could be the gif). You also have a dimensionality to it\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the critiques. Daniel you commented that everything screams for attention. This is true. This is actually intentional. The restaurant is located between 2 bars with heavy, crowded foot traffic especially on week-end nights. Some clients (at these   \nhours) are often inibriated, or in the process of becoming so.In some ways it's important to be a bit loud graphically speaking. The same reason for using reflective materials. As you can tell from menu (prices) this is not high-end, but really great Mediterranean basics at affordable prices. The owner made a lot of good decisions with the location and menu offerings. The result is that often the place is packed with people waiting in line. I think what has become most obvious in all the critiques is that the forks may be too \"obvious\" instead of a little added nuance. The bold type is unusual for menu design but in my opinion appropriate to the clients. I do have a ligther weight which looked classier but was ruled out because it was less legible at a distance. There is no menus on the tables but a couple huge backlit menus with photos of the food behind the counter. I should comment that design should always be viewed in context, which is obviously somewhat limited on a discussion board, as atmosphere is hard to absord as well as antisipating   \nthe interaction clients are having with the design/and or services offered. I sent the typophile link to my client with the warning that people visiting site leaving critiques are pros and   \noften very critical compared to his customers visiting the establishment. He phoned me after reading a few critiques and sounded a bit shocked. He is a great client to work with and has left me with a lot of the choices other than the actual content. A lot of trust- which was much apprciated. So what did I learn from this experience/job. well for starters, most designs can always be improved upon (especially if budget/time frame allows), Example- one of my firms web designs we did for a client last year is not to my personal quality standars, as it could be refined (which we just started on) but with 36 hrs to launch from start to finish- the timing was the priority and not the fine tuning of all elements and text. The solution: do your best. To be honest, this job ran 40 hours over budget (which I ate) due to a miscalculation on the extremely slow process of working at full resolution on the backlit 160\" x 24 menu boards that are over 800 megs (at 240 flattened dpi), with many changes over the   \ncourse of the job. Client ended up getting a bit impatient as things were running late (which is understandable), so where does one quit. Hopefully not untill it is the best it can be. But when exactly is that? A lot of smaller budget jobs do not allow for focus groups, so it becomes a lot of personal choices based on observations regarding the clients target market, objectives, etc...   \nAlways a challenge, but I guess this is why we loved doing what we do.\n\n"

      "content": "Hey Randy. Thanks for the props. Well I am afraid I will dissappoint you a bit, as stated earlier it is only the Logo type that I designed, not the body copy (called Harmony, by designer unkown to me). The reason for choosing the body copy to be set in Harmony vs. all the other choices out there, was that it is readable at a distance, familiar and friendly like the folks that work at Med Mix. As for the Logo type, the chisel effect with a single source of light, was kind of where this was going when I started but then it shifted direction into where it ended up... an eclectic mix of cuts. As for the devits, I confess I was unable in solving the issue with the devits in the M. I tried 4 or five different angles/cuts but nothing worked so with the time running out, I chose the results yoy see. I will post a few other version in a few minutes so you can see process...   \nAs far as the borders. I am not exactly sure what this classic greek pattern is called but it is traditional. I personally like the mix of all the elements but perhaps it is not to everyones liking.   \nIn the mix of feelings people like yourself have about it, perhaps there could be a better choice to go with only forks, or just the border.\n\n"
