  "content": "This ambigram didn't have any specific purpose, more of a personal challenge.\n\nI used Bodoni as the basis. I wanted to make a different amibgram than a blackletter or script, since they seem to be the most forgiving to the form. I thought a modern serif could work & look somewhat unique.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419054018im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tumblr_kptql4Mv2a1qz4tq8o1_500_5509.jpg.jpeg)\n\n",

      "content": "I did try an fi ligature but it ended up hurting the perception of the t. the f ligature rotated 180 degrees is hard to see as 'i t'\n\nthe strengthening of the y tail is also something i tried but it made the initial i look less like an i\n\ni like the idea of the uppercase I in the 2nd and 3rd i. I might try it out.\n\n———————————————————-  \n [Read Between the Leading podcast](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419054018/http:/rbtl.us/) | [Pixelspread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419054018/http:/pixelspread.com/)\n\n"

      "content": "In an ambigram its natural that legibility is slightly compromised, but I have some issues with this. The \"in\" that flips to become \"y\" is not reading clearly as either one.\n\nAlso the \"N\" I realize is uppercase because it needs to flip, but it stands out a lot. Is it a smallcap or is it a shrunken uppercase N? Its stroke seems thin to me.\n\nAt the moment I see an \"N\" encased in characters. I piece together the \"infinity\" afterwards because I have previous knowledge that its an ambigram and thats the word to look for.\n\nI think the various stroke widths and the many serifs are throwing me off most.\n\n"
