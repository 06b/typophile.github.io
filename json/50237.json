An ambigrams can be a word read one way and be rotated 180 degrees to be read as the same word or a different word. Therefore,\n\nRead this word (or type out the letters you see in order you see them) then look at the 180 degree rotation of the word and read it (or type out the letters seen in order seen)\n\nIt is a fun little puzzle if you will for those who take the time to look at it. So have fun and give good feed back if you want. It would be appreciated.\n\nHint: it is a first and last name\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210163334im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ambipic_3445.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210163334im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ambipic2_3719.jpg)\n\n",
