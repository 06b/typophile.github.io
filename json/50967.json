In one of the masters, the start point is different. How do I correct it? 'Make node first' doesn't seem to work. In the one troublesome master, the starting node is at 5/8 [2] instead of 1/8 [1]. The bar is two elements of four points each - - simple as possible.\n\n",

      "content": "By contrast, in Fog, if you have two elements and simply cut and paste one of them, it is automatically no. 2 of the two elements. It would be nice to have a more explicit way of controlling these things in Fontlab, and of course, we need the ability to edit individual masters with more control than we have now. Something like a switch that would just turn all the forced conformity off. Tant pis, if it results in incompatible masters for some users. Nobody will be using it who doesn't know what he or she is going.\n\n"
