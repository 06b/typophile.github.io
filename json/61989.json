  "content": "Hey guys,  \nThis is my first post here, hopefully its successful!\n\nIn school i am creating a Type poster about the space race. There is to be commentary on what was going on in that era (the late 60's) So far the poster has somewhat of an international style. Mainly, it is about the USA vs USSR in the race to space. I am aware that the cold war was going on at this time as well, Also possibly turning it into a bit of a propaganda poster could work as well.\n\nNow, i was wonder if you guys could point me in the direction of some reference material which talks a bit about how design or typography was affected by the space race or the cold war.\n\nAny suggestions would be great!\n\n",

I'm trying to incorporate more of a propaganda feel to it as well. Right now it says, \"better dead than red\" and there is a spaceman falling from a moon shape.\n\nI'll have to keep researching and pushing it.\n\nAny more suggestions welcome!\n\n"
