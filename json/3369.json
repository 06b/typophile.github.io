  "content": "I�m designing the brand for my freelance work and would like to have some comments from the typophle erudite community.   \n   \nI�m aiming for the small bussineses of the local market (Celaya and i�ts surrounding towns) with about 600,000 in population with commercial and industrial activity. There are many designers in town working on small studies whose main offer is creativity and price so I intend to sell the \"Design by Objectives\" positioning. I am willing to do most of the works I get by subcontracting things I�m not good for like illustration and photography, on the future I would like to do more publishing work but there is not much market for it in here.   \n   \nNAME   \nI decided to avoid symbolic names because I want to be directly related to my work so I�m using \"Mu�oz\" alone, maybe I�ll have to add a label to describe the \"Industry\" and positioning I�m at as I found really hard to signify Design.   \n   \nLOGO   \nThe first thing I made was the type on which I�m willing to connotate power, graphics and contundence so I chose geometric, lineal, abstract, bold and angular. After I chose the bow and arrow as symbols to metaphorize the positioning as if I were an archer with very good aim to hit targets, so I tried different options to integrate this to the name in graphic congruence:   \n   \nThis is the logotype   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121355im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27519.gif)   \n   \nThis is the only succesful bow, arrow and type integration I achieved   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121355im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27520.gif)   \n   \nThis is my monogram on a centaur.

I don�t think it�s too aggresive (just enough) but maybe it has some kind of totalitarian \"SS\" look. I�ll try to counteract this feeling with the graphic layouts and color, maybe some type adjustements.   \n   \nMy second choice is the sole centaur, it�s more static and maybe boring but it�s the clearest, I�ll give it a try with color and type, maybe inclination.   \n   \nThe name on the top will accompany the final choice symbol, that�s why I�m concerned of graphic coherence.   \n   \nI�ll post the next sketches with colour in a couple of days.\n\n"

It is a bit darker than the sketch was. There are two suggested variations of it but I think it still works better plain as it is.   \n ![centauro](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121355im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28195.gif)   \n   \n   \nThis is the type, advice on it is the most wellcome. It looks a little odd and I�m not getting a very good integration between the letters.   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121355im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28196.gif)   \n   \n   \nThese are a couple of type and logo integrations, I want the centaur to have lots of space to stand out so I�m favouring the vertical setting.   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121355im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28197.gif)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121355im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28198.gif)   \n   \n   \nFinally these are my color choices, the red is pantone 193 coated and the gray blue is pantone 5497 coated. Both of these colors are different enough from the main local design competitors, as far as I know no one uses red, which I think makes a great emphasis but maybe the gray blue could bring more convenient connotations.   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121355im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28199.jpg)\n\n"

Try overlapping them a little more.   \n2. My preference is the type and icon seperate from each other (play with the proportions one to the other). In this setting I think your spikey capital M is out of place. I think it detracts from the icon, is too tall, and not in keeping with the character of the font. I'd suggest maybe using a slightly taller version of the n and add the extra branch.   \n   \nOk, one other minor thing. Try the tilde as a little lightning strike nestled above the n (more like the z).   \n   \nVery nice indeed.   \nWell done.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

Quadraat Sans fits very well with Nobel (being both from the same designer) and gives my documents a very nice bussiness class look.   \n   \nI made red silkscreened folders with the reversed application of the logo as well as white cover sheets with the folder�s application in red and I�m looking for some cheap cd cards to put my portfolio in. I�ll be building other applications on the fly but I deffinitively discarded doing a shirt and a pin, maybe I�ll make a mug.\n\n"
