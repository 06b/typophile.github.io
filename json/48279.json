Obviously, going to need to be something users from different operating systems are able to see, and as of now would like to keep it around 10 or 11 points.\n\nBasically, it’s a blog on Wordpress by and for student designers, and we’re about to pay so we can edit the CSS. The current template we’re using has Arial strung across it, and I can no longer take it.\n\nSo, body copy suggestion that will work at 10 or11 points? I’ve been going through the fonts on my computer and have some in mind, but am looking for some other thoughts.\n\n [‹ Type on an arc?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122072357/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48381 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [kerning law & uniform type ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122072357/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48371 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The best ones for text out of that small bunch are Georgia, Verdana, Times (New Roman), Arial, Trebuchet, Courier (in my order of body copy preference). I would recommend Georgia or Verdana myself.\n\n"

I’m going to take a look at Georgia on the site now, as I passed it earlier I thought about, but never took a look at it.\n\nWhat is the typeface for the posts in this forum? I can’t believe I can’t just look at it and know. I guess I’d rather ask than make a ridiculous guess.\n\n"
