Lavender Script [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/lavender-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828221243/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/lavender-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/lavender-script/\") and Shelly Script [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/shelley-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828221243/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/shelley-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/shelley-script/\") could also work. Balladeer Light also has a similar feel even though it is not a connected script.

My idea was that if someone wanted to make a replica of the word-mark emblem writing tool details could be blurred out for use in the 3-D printing process. I agree that they would not work properly if used \"as is.\"  \nDon\n\n"
