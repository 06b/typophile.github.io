  "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI'm not sure how active this forum is? As a New Zealander I am currently doing major project, here is my central question:\n\nThe black-letter Fraktur was Germany’s national choice of typeface style, however because it was terminated almost indefinitely by Hitler in WW2 I propose this question: can validity be restored to the typeface style, fraktur, which was defaced and became an index of inhumanity?\n\nHow does everyone see the reputation of blackletter today?  \n- negative/positive etc\n\nWhat i'm really wondering is how can i start restoring validity? How can i design a typeface that is sensitive and honouring its history? One that moves people because of the context it is placed in. My original interest in blackletter was a link through from my empathy to the victims of WW2. Is their a way i can get that kind of empathy into the blackletter? Lots of questions - do i really want to get that empathy coming through (i.e.bringing back the past), like a memorial???\n\n",

They seem to dislike blackletter, mostly because they want to distance themselves from the past, espcially the Nazi past. (Blackletter's hey-day, say 1450–1800, is not a period that modern Germans can associate with either. Almost nothing in their daily lives has anything to do with it. Blackletter was also highly tied up with Religion, especially the Protestant Reformation. As most young Germans are not religious, this is just one more strike against blackletter).\n\nFortunately, the world is much bigger! Even if the Germans never use blackletter again,\\* there are still plenty of other people left to like it.\n\nI think that the reason that Blackletter isn't seen so often anymore is because almost none of the blackletter fonts available for computer users today are optimized for smaller text sizes.

I have had a good look around on the Typophile site and it is good to have that pool of information when it's not necessarily out in books everywhere.\n\n_Blackletter:Type and National Identity and Paul Renner's book_ have been a great kick start for my research. They are full of good information. I have briefly compared Futura and Fraktur/blackletter/ww2 in an essay. However, as the tutor pointed out, I need to consider that these are on completely opposite poles. Futura was the extreme of modernism and fraktur at the other end.\n\n_Validating_  \nThat is a good quesiton. My tutor actually asked me that the other day. Initially I am thinking that I want to bring a positive aspect to blackletter and something fresh compared to what it has taken on leading up to it's demise.  \nPerhaps it is more modernity that I'm wanting to inject(contemporary not historically). I realise this has been talked on typophile already.\n\nThe idea of a readable blackletter applicable for text use today sounds affable.\n\n_Most young Germans do not care_  \nYes, I do not know many Germans myself. Are any of you German? I spoke to a German student who is just in New Zealand for a short time. Here are his comments:\n\nblackletter in Germany is  \n- very rarely seen, however...  \n- it is used in some modern type books  \n- playing with just the one single letterform  \n- they use the knowledge that it is old type to play around with it and use it as something completely different to the modern  \n- I think it is cool to bring it back to play around with but not as whole text (he must be one of the few who like??)  \n- they always use the very traditional, never WW2 blackletter\n\nSo it appears from above it is more of a left field art in Germany??\n\nValidity is really what I need to crack down on.\n\n"

And on beer and wine labels. But these things are all old, and don't speak very well to younger generations.\n\nI do like how younger designers play with blackletter on posters and flyers. Yet I get a feeling that a lot of this is just because that sort of thing is done so much (more) in other countries.\n\nOf course lots of young German designers are interested in blackletters. But compared with younger designers in other countries, the proportion is smaller. Blackletter was all over 1990s graphic design in Florida. And London has more blackletter throughout the city (both old and new) than anywhere in Germany (although there it is textura/old-english instead of fraktur).\n\nEven Mexico, as is discussed elsewhere here, has more blackletter integration in the daily visual culture than Germany in 2006.\n\nIf I were to oversimply, I would say that Germany's visual culture, typographically speaking, is all about sans serif typefaces (AG, Helvetica, Univers, Frutiger, DIN, DIN again, DIN again and again, Meta, etc.).\n\n"

Their rounded edges remind me alot of the bauhaus below.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221131653im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bauhaus_3480.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221131653im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Brussel_02_5138.jpg)\n\nThe designer has taken the broken and angled characteristics of blackletter and made a feature out of them in this typeface. I really like the idea of doing it that way, makes it a bit simpler anyway. I wonder what inspired them?\n\nPlacing the blackletter with the pink (contemporary use of colour) also makes it more modern and friendly.\n\nThey are still quite quirky letterforms however, and perhaps that's something of blackletter that will always be seen when made today? Maybe?\n\n"
