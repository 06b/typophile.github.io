  "content": "While I go merrily along kerning using class-based kerning in FontLab, I would like a way to turn the blue color off of the non-key glyphs in the Metrics window. It would be great if I could just hit the tilde key for a second while I judge the proximity of a kern pair but I would settle for something clumsier if that were all that were possible. I have tried clicking on the “Preview” mode but that does not seem to do anything at all. I get all characters in black only while in metrics mode but this does not help me judge a kerning pair. Is there some hidden magic I have overlooked or is this just another known bug that has not been fixed?\n\nChrisL\n\n [‹ Family Grouping in Adobe CS Font Menu](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828112212/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42972 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [FontLab Studio 5 Metrics Assistance Problem ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828112212/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43243 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
