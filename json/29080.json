  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI'm looking for any fonts that are stroke-only.... i.e they have no fill, and are made of line only.\n\nIt's for a video project where i want to 'write' the text on in neon light. I can get a filter to do this in AfterEffects but need type that's more-or-less continuous (handwriting/script) and is 'stroke-only'.\n\nany ideas?\n\nthanx in advance.  \nVV\n\n",

If you want to make center lines from a font, you'll have to copy the letters, erase everything but one outer stroke, paste it, erase everything but the other outer stroke (this is where you might have to do some adjusting like linking to separate parts from one stroke to make sure you get the 2 outer strokes) & thenuse the blend tool (set it to one step).  \nThe copy/paste thing is needed because you can't use the blend tool on a single object & even if you cut a path, Illustrator will still see it as one object.\n\n"
