The new rasterizer for Flash is kind of a mess (see the insert image link at the bottom of the page). I really dislike the rasterizer that Adobe puts into its DTP apps. Photoshop anti-aliasing is mega-blurry, which is fine when you are going to print at 300dpi, but lousy for screen graphics. InDesign and Illustrator rely too much on hinting, distorting the type for on screen reading — bad for wysiwyg apps targeted at high res printers. It would be better for the type to show up a little blurrier, while giving a better sense of how the spacing and color are working out. I've been tricked more than once into kerning a hinted line of type in InDesign, only to discover upon zooming in/printing that I had been deceived by the hinting.\n\n"

I'm comming at this as a designer of websites. PC running XP IE6 FF2, Mac Safari 2 .. both sides at default settings since most leave it like it comes out of the box.\n\nMy biggest gripe with pc screen typography is that certain sizes of certain fonts look fantastic. But heaven forbid that you specify bold at that size. Or increase the size 1px. Case in point, Arial Bold 14px (nastified). Verdana 16px Bold (bold? bold?). Up to 17px, ok now it's bold, but the spacing is all wack. In fact, i would say px sizes 14+ look ghastly on my pc.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150206002834im_/http:/typophile.com/files/compare_4242.gif)\n\nNo fair you say? Clear Type not turned on in the PC example. How many users open Control Panel \\> Display \\> Effects \\> Screen Font \\> Clear Type to click that box? My issue is what joe pc sees when he fires up his Dell box, but Ok. Now clear type is active:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150206002834im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cleartype_6577.gif)\n\nHey that 17px is looking much better on the pc. Beter than the mac? Debatable. How is the 16px? Craptastic spacing and contrast. Mac? Still pretty decent.\n\nIn conclusion: on a PC without cleartype, 10% of type options get an A, 90% get a C-. With cleartype on, the percentages improve somewhat. Out of the box on a mac, 100% get an A-. I'll take freedom and an A-. Call me artsy.\n\nR\n\n"
