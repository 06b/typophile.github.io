  "content": "I’m currently in designer’s limbo. It’s not that I’m not designing, but I’ve become very stodgy with my designs.\n\nI work as an in-house designer for a very dry consulting firm that deals with the Navy. Most of the stuff I do is very formulaic. I create a template and then adjust it slightly for every iteration of a project. I get to do a lot of things but nothing is really experimental or even remotely creative.\n\nThe worse thing about it is, I’m truly the only creative energy in the office, I art direct myself with the little input I have from the project heads. I remember in college the creative energy was so strong, like a giant forest blaze. Here it’s like a nitelite.\n\nUltimately, I’d really like to move on. I have friends and family in Philadelphia, and I understand the opportunities are exponential. I can’t make the move right now for personal reasons unrelated to design, but maybe later this year.\n\nMy concern is I think I’ve become pessimistic to design. I no longer find it appealing, and I think it’s because of my current environment. I’m in a funk and I think it’s going to disrupt my chances of moving into the next stage of my career. I like the company I work for, and I can’t deny the comfort of my current life. But, I know I’ve made artistic sacrifices for it.\n\nAm I doomed, has anyone been in my position before? Is it a stage we all go through? How can I be re-motivated and inspire myself to seek a better creative outlet?\n\n [‹ Book or any Publication designing, need help](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905100514/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32923 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [\"Why will Johnny no longer want to read?\" ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905100514/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32774 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

They offered me a job & hesitantly I agreed thinking I’d keep my eyes open for a more creative job. Now my job description has expanded to -mostly making the layout for dull advertisements in cheap papers/magazines- & every now & then (whenever we get a more “creative” task) designing a logo or housestyle. I have to say that in my case I’ve changed my opinion of what I want to do & now actually enjoy dull assignments. When I graduated from high school I was very excited about finally going to art school, but everything about it disappointed me to a level that I stopped drawing for a couple of years (I used to draw manually & wanted to become a cartoonist ever since I was a kid). At that point, I was getting some recognition for my comics, but I wasn’t able to do anything with it ’cause I lost the will to draw. Currently, I’m constantly drawing in my spare time & LOVE the fact that you don’t have to make any compromises. You’re your own best judge & personally I always have trouble communicating about my designs with people who know \\*\\*\\* about it. I keep my dull job just to escape from the risc of losing my hobby. I don’t know if this makes any sense to you at all, but let me put it this way: if you really enjoy being creative, no job will stop you from doing so except maybe one that requires you to be creative and compromise in your designs. A lot of people here will probably disagree with me, but my advice is: don’t mix business with pleasure!\n\n"

Comfort is the enemy!\n\nOne way I got out of that was by switching jobs, but since you can’t do that just yet, I have a few suggestions:\n\nIf there is some specific area of design that you’ve always been particularly keen on and want to get into in Philly, start preparing for that now by giving yourself assignments to do in your spare time. You can also look at it as a portfolio-building endeavor.\n\nAnother way would be to sign up for a design-related workshop or class — something that would get you in touch with like-minded individuals, teachers, etc., who could offer you a fresh perspective on design. Since you are here on Typophile, I suggest a letterpress class, but it could be anything that would get you out of the box you are in. (Maybe you could even do some informational interviews at other studios where you now live.)\n\nAlso, just remind yourself that you won’t be in that job forever, and that things aren’t hopeless. :-)\n\n"

He wrote his first novels that way.\n\nBut of course, that approach removes the comfortable living.  \nI can relate, too. I’m in a job with no hope of going anywhere better, and I am rapidly running out of things to learn, but it pays the bills and so I’m not entirely motivated to shake up my world right yet.\n\nK.\n\n"

I was outspoken and made a point to comment on everything any chance I got. I found most of the design projects were “easy” and I wouldn’t put as much effort as I could/should have. After school I felt I was OWED a job in a well established design house, oh the reality hit me VERY VERY HARD! My father actually found me a place in his company and for the last 3 years the confidence I had in college slowly suffocated under the shear boredom of my work. I’m not under-appreciated for my talents, but I’m not necessarily challenged either.\n\nI know a lot of people would kill for my position, and I shouldn’t complain, but I have this feeling I’ve “sold out” and not in a good way.\n\n"

      "content": "It is easy to think a “dream job” will just visit you one day soon and all will be well. The truth is, any job is work and much of it is not fulfilling and creative. Dream jobs rarely happen and some of those dreams evolve into nightmares. This is not a design career issue. It is an any career issue. You get paid to do the things someone else either can’t or does not want to do. Much of it is not fun, all of it is work. You are already planning a change which is good. Realize that wherever you go, it will never be like school again. You pay them to go to school—they pay you to work. This creates different expectations. Customers have more say-so than employees because they pay the bills. I know this sounds cold and unencouraging. You do have other options though. Youcan find your satiation in outside interests, you can periodically change jobs, and you can start your own office. Starting your own office means much more responsibility and less free time as well as that sinking feeling that you may not cover expenses that month. The reward is more creative freedom but that is ALWAYS tempered by the needs and or desires of the client. Don’t “expect” to be given nothing but plumb jobs with big budgets. It won’t happen. It seems there is a roughly 90-10 rule. You work hard through 90% of your work doing less than exciting stuff so that you might get the opportunity to do something better with the remaining 10%.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

One evening I found myself looking at photos of dry cleaning establishments in strip malls in Naples, Florida and I was just paralyzed. I just couldn’t fathom what I could do with them. I’m a decent designer, but as a freelancer I was never a good salesperson, and as far as being a professional... I was really only ever an amateur. Now I’m in grad school to be a librarian, which will suit me as a career much better and I can be an amateur designer again. Already I feel energized, taking on little projects for environmental goups, rock bands, political campaigns, just the stuff that I feel like doing but couldn’t really do before because it didn’t pay enough and took too much time.\n\n"

Be very specific in your letters as to why you want to work for THEM. Studios, publishers, everybody likes enthusiasm. I was in a somewhat dead-end yet comfortable (and fun) job once and about to be offered a job I was very ambivalent about (creatively, not financially) and sent out a bunch of letters cold to places I wanted to work for, got a great response - the two publishers I was most excited about ended up offering me jobs.\n\nReally if you have serious creative aspirations get out of where you are. It will kill your spirit and do nothing for your portfolio. And during the process, take on small freelance design jobs as they arrive to broaden your samples.\n\n"

      "content": "Well, I’m glad to see I’m not the only one who keeps business & pleasure apart ;-) Obviously in my case -as in your case, Asvetic- they do cover the same territory, but the rules are different. I have also considered changing careers completely -make a 120° turn even, but the problem is that I’m only qualified for graphic design. I’ve never really cared about how much I make as long as I’m not unhappy with what I’m doing & with that in mind I might even look for a job in a video- or musicstore (2 other passions).  \nI’m frequently asked to “design” things for friends & family -& even though they trust me enough to give me carte blanche- I always feel inhibited to do MY thing. Giving myself little projects to do suffies for me to silence that creative bug. I write as well, so I have the opportunity to shift between hobby’s whenever I get stuck. Some people have this amazing gift where they can always -under any given circumstances- inspire themselves. I myself depend on the inspiration my muse brings me. Sometimes she’s overloaded, sometimes she carries nothing... but I’ve learned to deal with that. I just let every idea I get grow on its on accord. This way I get the best results & I’ll always have something to do. In a work environment, results are expected within a given deadline & personally I like to distance myself from a piece of work for a while before judging it. So I keep my dull job & I keep enjoying myself in my spare time. For me, this is the perfect solution. Besides, there are always other ways to get the “recognition” you can get from a satisfying job... There’s plenty of places (online & offline) where creative talent is shown however the artist wanted it to be, even when it seems utterly useless.  \nFunnily enough, I’m currently writing about this, how I see my (personal) work & what I hope to achieve with it & I’ve had a really long discussion with a friend lately who encouraged me to dò something with my designs. The conclusion is that my hobby is MY hobby & the only reward I need from that is the pleasure I get from looking at the result (keeping in mind the whole work process) & that any “confirmation” from outside is merely a bonus to me. Work is only a necessary evil to pay the bills.\n\n"

I don’t specifically judge myself, it’s more of an unconscious comparison to other designs and designers that I come in contact with. I know I’m capable to doing more than I’ve been doing and I know I haven’t been successful at reaching my full capabilities. I haven’t been pushed and I haven’t been pushing myself.\n\nBut, how do you know if the process is successful? How do you know if you’re failing enough? The one thing that keeps the art in design is the constant sense of doubt the designer [sic] artist has. A piece is NEVER finished, it just reached a point that it was acceptable and the process has been satisfactory in achieving a solution. It’s NEVER finished because there are infinite solutions with infinite processes.\n\n"

      "content": "I know when I’ve done a good design. However, a good design can easily get shot down by a client who has a different vision than mine. So I no longer beat myself up when they request changes that (to me) weaken it. I have enough in my portfolio now that I can’t get too worked up if every single piece isn’t smashing. It’s harder to accept that when you’re just starting out. Pick my battles, I guess.\n\nI don’t think you should get hung up on whether or when the design is finished. Sometimes you nail it pretty quickly, other times it’s more of a process. And sometimes it’s worth working thru alternate solutions even if you’re pretty sure you got it right the first time, you might surprise yourself. I find (more often than not) if I can basically “see” the design in my head before I start it’s more likely to be successful. If I initially draw a blank, I can oftentimes work up something I (and the client) am happy with but it may not make it into my portfolio.\n\nI also find that it can be tremendously gratifying to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. There are books I’ve done that I’d never show anybody because they’re boring or dumb but I can still look at them and know I did a good design. And enjoy the process.\n\n——-\n\nI should add that I don’t design for fun. I design for work. I do think it’s fun (and recognize that I’m lucky to like my day job) but I’m not invested in being the best or most famous or most ground-breaking earth-shattering designer around. My creative outlet (and passion) is painting.\n\n"

      "content": "That’s exacltly what takes me so long to “finish” something to my own satisfaction. I tend to set bounderies for every design (or rather let the design set its own bounderies as it grows) & then try all possible designs within those bounderies. It’s often very hard to -objectively, as far as that’s possible ofcourse- compare two or more results & that’s where a little time & distance come in handy. When working on something for too long, I get too sunk into it that I can’t even tell what’s good anymore. I have many unfinished designs & half-ideas that will most likely never be realized, but every now and then I find a second breath for a specific design & I can re-enjoy working on it. I very often can’t help but wonder what the \\*\\*\\* I was thinking when I look at a design after a while, but that’s probably part of a natural evolution. Even if you don’t want to, subconciously you will always find your skills, taste & talent evolving which obviously leads to a different view on your designs (sometimes -if not most of the time- even dissatisfaction). But in the end, you have to see it how it is: a learning process of which each step can be enjoyed.  \nI really lòve this thread, does it show? ;-p\n\n"

The only conclusion I can make from that is that in these cases silence is indeed golden. People often don’t seem to see the process a design has to go through before being done. Even if something ends up looking encredibly simple (which is mostly the case in the things I do) & even if the design itself really IS simple, it doesn’t necessarely imply that the process of getting there was equally simple. I usually find the hardest part of designing limiting myself & trying not to overdo things. The easy answer is never the most obvious & you have to through different phases of narrawing it down & letting go of things.  \nAlso the matter of “designing for fun” remains an issue for me. I guess -depending on how you would interprete “for fun”- I never really do anything for fun. I draw things just to get the ideas out of my head so I can get some sleep. If I leave an idea untouched, it will drive me crazy... I at least have to give myself the opportunity to check if an idea is actually worth persuing. Drawing to me is like an itch I hàve to scratch. I know this probably sounds cocky, but that’s the best way I can describe it. The pleasure for me lies in seeing it develop & the reward I get from the final result, but everything I do starts with some kind of (compulsive) “need” to do it (whether that comes from an idea I get or from a task that is being given to me). And as for my job, well, that just pays the bills. In some kind of paradoxal way I actually enjoy nòt enjoying my job ;-) I’m not unhappy with what I do & in the end I know I’ll still get that pleasure in my own time.\n\n"
