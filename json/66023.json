  "content": "I am a traditional typographer having difficulty understanding HTML tools, some are easy, such as _emphasis_; though why \"ital\" wasn't used rather than \"em\" is a mystery; shouldn't \"em\" have been reserved for an em-space?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823062845im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Type-example_3997.jpg)\n\nThe above example is easy to set in typographic programs such as QuarkXPress or InDesign, and the coding made sense on Quadex and other type systems, back in the day. Note that there are hanging numerals in bold, the text is set 9/11, with alignment for breaking lines, and 2 pts additional space between paragraph returns.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823062845im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Superior_4827.jpg)\n\nThe same goes for the superior shown, again, easy in Quark or InDesign, nearly impossible (at least to me) in HTML.\n\nThe dialogue in Quark is easy for a typographer to understand:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823062845im_/http:/typophile.com/files/QuarkDialogue_5061.png)\n\nI've been wading through page after page of code for two days now, and am more befuddled than when I began. Can someone please recommend a resource for learning Dreamweaver, HTML, and CSS that is geared to typographers? The web people I've been able to speak to seldom understand even the word \"leading\". Can someone give me some hope?\n\n",

      "content": "Originally, HTML, and SGML on which it was based, was highly unfriendly to typographers. Initially you didn't have access to leading, paragraph indents, or paragraph spacing. We still are hampered with lack of hyphenation, making justified text ugly, although possible. It was all originally built by a committee of programmers, with little or no typographic input.\n\nWhen CSS came out, it did get some input from typographers, and you can now do many more things. (Although I am still baffled how you can use em as a dimension without it being based on some other element).\n\nSlowly the ugly is being squeezed out of HTML, but it is a slow process.\n\nI suggest that the hardest step for a print designer is to learn that on the Web, you never know what size of 'paper' you are designing for. Get past that, and you are more than half way towards being a web designer.\n\nOh yeah, you did ask a question ... I use [http://www.w3schools.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823062845/http:/www.w3schools.com/ \"http://www.w3schools.com\") as an excellent learning resource on HTML and CSS.\n\n"

Blind people are using screenreaders. If the markup is misused for the style, the access to the content is harder for them. Cascading Style Sheets are not limited to the visual style by the way. But how should a screenreader interpret the expression \"italic\"? The expression indicates a visual style, while \"emphasis\" indicates \"importance\". Additionally it would be absurd to style the italic element upright bold with the help of CSS, while there are cases in which it makes sense to style the em element upright bold.\n\nFor the same reason you should make use of attributes like \"title\" or elements like \"acronym\". In case of the acronym-element the handicap is the limited knowledge of the user. The biggest handicap is stupidity. This does not mean, that you always should design for the most stupid user, but in case of websites, that are intended to be used by a wide range of users, that don’t belong to a group with special interests, the Amazon website or a government website for example, you should keep in mind, that many people are more stupid than you or that many people are less competent than you.\n\nThere are cases, in which blinds are not in your target group. I think, this website is one example – although even on this website you probably find discussions about braille.\n\n"

Partly because I'm not a pundit and have to adhere to demands of others and partly because the more you learn about web accessibility, the more gray area you find within it. It's getting better (really looking forward to ARIA standards).\n\nIn the end, it all depends. Apply and/or ignore the rules of thumb based on the context of the site you are building.\n\nricadus is sort-of correct. If the numeral is an image, and a user changes their font size, it may not scale in relation to the type. You could get around that by sizing the image in ems. The other issue if a person is using page-zoom (via the OS or the browser itself) the image will scale, but quickly become much more pixelated than the text. That may be an issue. But that's but one way to skin the cat.\n\nYou can do a lot with HTML + CSS but there are limitations when comparing it to traditional typesetting.
