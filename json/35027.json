  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI am working on a freelance project for an Economy and Politics Magazine. I dunno if it will finally see the light one day or not. I was searching for fonts that could give functional to read as well as this conservative (as most of this magazines are) but with a touch of modernity and freshness. I dunno if I am clear.\n\nI thought for body text maybe Hoefler Text or Century Style but they are very well know already. For Sans type I thought of Caecilia or Officina Sans.\n\nNot sure yet, what do you think or like? It would be nice to have your oppinions.\n\nBest,  \nSebastiao\n\n [‹ Condensed Sans Serif w/ Personality](http://web.archive.org/web/20070824232329/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34912 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type and design on website ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070824232329/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33701 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
