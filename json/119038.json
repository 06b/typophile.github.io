  "content": "I want to test an Arabic web font to see if the OpenType features are enabled. It is important for Arabic fonts that \"liga\" and other OpenType features are always \"on\" because in most cases the letters have to be connected. In other way, the font looks broken. I have read that browsers enable OT features automatically only for Western typefaces. For Arabic you have to write extra code in the css file (font-feature-settings: \"liga\" 1, \"dlig\" 1;). Any ideas?\n\n",
