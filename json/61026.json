And also set the sponsors logo smaller, if they don't mind, of course. :D\n\n"

      "content": "When I read the name of the show, and see the the trippy 70s headline font, here's what comes to mind:\n\n- Loud, informal, fun.\n- Celebration of lowbrow, pop culture (flipping the bird to highbrow art).\n- Retro-modern (the future as seen through 20th-Century imagination).\n\nHere's the problem: It's too damn tasteful. The carefully balanced layout with elegant flourishes and double rules undermine the B-movie aesthetic you're (probably) aiming for.\n\nI'd start by throwing out the grid. Make the whole thing more crowded and busy. Be more adventurous in your choice of body type(s). Make the 2 photo images bigger, and tilt one or both of them. If I were designing this, I'd put \"music by Johnny Tran\" in a speech balloon coming out of the alien's mouth, but that's just me. (If you do put anything in a speech balloon, _don't_ use Comic Sans!)\n\n"

This will make them look more scotch tape-like.\n\nRight now, it looks like it says \"The Robots Art Show vs. Aliens.\" You'll have to play with that a bit because moving \"Art Show\" and bumping up \"vs. Aliens\" will create weird negative space issues.\n\n"
