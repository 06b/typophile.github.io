  "content": "Can someone tell me how to extract a font face from a font family? I have the Gill Sans font family but need Gill Sans bold as a separate font.\n\nIt's complicated to explain why, but I'm working on a big Flash project and the engineering team can only get one face for a font to work with our embedding process. I need both font faces as their own font to embed them both.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

They are instructed not to send them anymore. As a type designer I say yeah, but as a book designer, I say bugger me with 6 ft pole. And I did. And happily my publisher was ready to pay for the font.\n\nThat means that language versions get their pay.\n\nSo, designers, hold on to your designs; change could be happening.\n\n"
