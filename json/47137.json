He is like a text with the problematic words then he codes something like \"right side of a is equal to ...\" and he just kerns once some letters and so see what i mean? Then he tries on the preview of FontLab the problematic words and so.  \nAnyway, i was looking for a lit of problematic words and so and how to code that thing of \"right side\" \"left side\" i never coded opentype, already coded a lot of stuff like PHP, HTML, AS and so on and on but never opentype.\n\nJoel Santos // youremin  \nsound & visual\n\n"

      "content": "You really have to spin through every possible pair. For example, only \"u\" follows \"q,\" right? Ever set transliterated Chinese? Or how about \"g\" following a cap \"Y\"? Seem odd? Well, the name of King Arthur's mom is \"Ygraine.\"\n\nYou need a bunch of letters in the kern window, so as not to fool your eye. I start with an \"e\", follow it with the leading character, then the character to be kerned, then several other letters. For example, starting out with lower case,\n\neaalestying\n\nwhere the letter I'm kerning is \"a\" (the first one). The second letter (also an \"a\" above) is the trailing one of the pair. Just use the keyboard to change & kern the second letter (from \"a\" to \"b\" through \"z\"), then change the first letter to \"b\" & continue on. In FontLab, the fastest is to also use the keyboard for entering the kern values. You have increments of plus/minus 100, 10 and 1 quickly available.\n\nDon't forget punctuation, esp. periods, commas, and the quote marks. And BTW, most of us don't consider an apostrophe an accent. Give it some space. Another thing to look out for are prefixes and word endings. I usually find the \"n\"& \"g\" in \"ing\" need a touch. Try several words ending in \"ing\".\n\netc.\n\nFWIW\n\n"
