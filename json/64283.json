But I was also wondering if anyone knew of anything a bit more unusual or interesting.\n\n"

      "content": "Your tackling a very vast timeframe, and a lot of things have happened and changed in this period in design. Trying to pin it down to a list of typefaces is hard, because some might have been very fashionable in the 30s but quite out of style in the 50s. As I said Gill Sans immediately comes to mind (and Joanna and Perpetua are also by Eric Gill). Johnston is a typeface that shares characteristics with Gill. So I guess that's a very recognisable British style. Unless you want to go for the full on design history approach, I would advise you to narrow your field of vision down to a smaller period. And then have a look at british graphic design from that period and try to find the common thread, or formal simularities. There's probably design anthologies of British graphic design you can have a look at. You can always return here to find out which typefaces are used in those designs.\n\ngreetings Jeffrey  \n [infraordinaire](http://web.archive.org/web/20111219044513/http:/www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress)\n\n"
