  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am a french type and graphic designer recently arrived in Washington DC, and in few weeks, I will be allowed to work in the USA.  \nSo, I am looking for any contact related to graphic/type design studios, galeries, bookshops, or foundries in DC area.  \nI need to know more about graphic design culture here so if anybody could help me, I would be pleased.\n\nI have already had a look on this topic:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/31239](http://web.archive.org/web/20091204034427/http:/typophile.com/node/31239 \"http://typophile.com/node/31239\")\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

But take advantage of the free art museums on the national mall. Drive (or take a train) to Baltimore and see the American visionary museum, the real gem of the area.\n\n<cite>bookshops</cite>  \nFor a visitor there are no interesting bookstores left in the Washington area (especially if youâ€™re used to good French bookstores). If you really love American politics you might want to try Kramer Books or Politics and Prose. Second Story Books at 22nd and P in NW Washington sometimes has good used books at prices far cheaper than most stores, and now that I have left town nobody is buying up all his design books.\n\n<cite>foundries</cite>  \nThere are none.\n\nYou can try connecting with the [DC AIGA](http://web.archive.org/web/20091204034427/http:/aigadc.org/). Business in DC slows almost to a halt between the middle of November and the middle of January, so this is a good time to connect with people, but make appointments in advance as many people will be on vacation.\n\n"
