  "content": "Hi everyone\n\nI’m redesigning a masthead for the excitingly titled PCAuthority magazine. Currently set in Champion (all caps, bold condensed). I’m looking at Meta, as it’s got a lot more personality, just thought I’d see if anyone had any other suggestions. Bearing in mind the number of characters it has to be slightly condensed.\n\nThanks all\n\n [‹ tracking in indesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908102411/http:/typophile.com/node/19165 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [And you thought you'd never use the 'ffl' ligature combination ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908102411/http:/typophile.com/node/19055 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Enter FF Meta Headline. Under the direction of Spiekermann & Christian Schwartz, Joshua Darden created three widths (normal, condensed, compressed) with four weights each. There are several alternate characters for tight setting: an ‘a’ and ‘l’ without tails and a simple ‘g’. A few arrows and dingbats are also included.\n\n"
