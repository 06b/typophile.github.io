  "content": "Hi all,\n\nJust wondering if anyone can suggest a good free replacement for ITC Berranger Hand?\n\nThis will mostly be for web use and will likely only be used for one or two tag lines, so the quality doesn’t have to be perfect. I love the character of Berranger Hand , and I’m having trouble finding something that has a similar feel to it.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
