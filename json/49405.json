But one thing concerns me: air quality. The reek of ink and solvents is constantly present and the room where the Macs are, where I would be working, has no windows.\n\nAre there known stats on printers and lung afflictions? Am I just being paranoid (or is my ambivalence about this $15/hour job showing itself) or is there actually some risk?\n\n [‹ »Type specimen« in other languages?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919034616/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49600 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Swash? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919034616/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49473 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Maybe it will provide some insight into what they’re doing health and ecologically - wise that maybe other printers aren’t but should be implementing for their staff;\n\n“We use an inert water based protective coating sealant on our products which is an eco-friendly alternative to polymer based coatings, “litho seal” and plastic laminates.\n\nWe run IPA - isopropyl alcohol - free on our printing presses, as opposed to the industry average of 8%.\n\nOur inks are vegetable oil based - specifically linseed oil - as opposed to mineral oil.\n\nThe removal of IPA alcohol and use of vegetable ink has virtually eliminated our emissions of VOC’s - Volatile Organic Compounds - into the atmosphere. These VOC’s are a major source of ozone pollution and are a potential a health hazard to our staff.\n\nWe promote full colour printing which uses significantly less chemicals, solvents and paper in job setup and press cleaning than traditional one or two colour printing.\n\nWe offer quality Digital Print solutions when appropriate to the job.”\n\nJH\n\n"

If the print shop takes care to keep its solvents in safety cans, that’s pretty much it. And that is only to prevent fire. Most solvents used today are fairly non-hazardess. And most printers seem to live an awfully long time.\n\nThat green stuff that jazzhustler put up is standard media greenwash.\n\nGerald\n\n"

Press-cleaning solutions are generally a mixture of chemicals that include various solvents, some of which are carcinogens. Adverse health effects from inhalation or skin contact include dermatitis, headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, respiratory failure, central nervous system depression, coughing, difficult breathing, chest pains, unconsciousness, and death. Chronic effects may include kidney and liver damage. Many press operators in small print shops have excessive exposures because these shops frequently have inadequate ventilation or other controls for the vapors.”\n\n“ [In printing and related industries,](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919034616/http:/72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:BjCt_YHy1LEJ:www.orosha.org/pdf/pubs/3119.pdf+printing+industry+health+hazards&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us) a variety of chemicals — including alcohols, glues, inks, dyes, cleaners, ammonia, lead, formaldehyde, paper dusts, and many types of solvents — can be found. Employee exposures to chemicals have been shown to be higher when associated with press wash-up tasks, use of isopropanol, using poor or improper work practices, and inadequate or improper use of ventilation systems. Workers should close containers for blanket wash, alcohol, or used shop towels. Recirculating pressroom air may save on heating or cooling costs; but it also increases concentrations of chemical contaminants in the air that workers breathe.”\n\n"

      "content": "I have a small print shop (12’x20’) with 2 Vandercooks, and I’m fairly conscious of the solvent vapours when I’m cleaning the presses. Generally speaking I take the rollers outside and set them on a work-bench I’ve rigged up to hold them during cleaning, and when I’m really on the ball I wear my respirator (I’m not on the ball all that often). When I have to clean the rollers & press inside, I leave the door open and turn on a ceiling fan, and I’m more conscious of wearing the respirator then. I have to admit, though, that this is more to avoid the dizzyness & headache I sometimes get without the respirator, rather than concern about long-term effects.\n\nThe thing is, this is only when I’m 2 feet from the solvent and it’s splashing around and turning to vapour right in front of me. Other than this, what I get is the smell of ink and solvent, and, quite frankly, I love that smell.\n\nBesides, I smoke, so this stuff is the least of my problem.\n\n"

If you are at all concerned about the health implications of your employment, then all your questions are valid.\n\nConditions in many printing and design shops can indeed be hazardous. Not perhaps to me, not perhaps to bieler. But they may be to you, and no one should dissuade you with flippant comments from your concerns. Each of us has different tolerances for solvents and air quality. It may sound flippant in a different way, but keep in mind that one of our main responsibilities is to take care of our own health in this nasty world. Employers won’t, unions won’t, government won’t.\n\nI have worked in a wide variety of printing & design shops for 40 years. Some people thrive in toxic conditions. Others succumb rapidly to what may seem to be only moderately malignant conditions. There is just no way to know what will get to whom when. I hope you can resolve this to your satisfaction.\n\n& given the state of the economy these days, it is just irresponsible to say such things as “why work on-site?” or “walk, and let some other mug get sick.” That set of comments shows a poor understanding of the reality of work. Sure, some folks get to work off-site. But that is a dream more than a reality in the work world of 2008. & Sure, some folks are willing to let others take the fall; that just ain’t a responsible attitude.\n\nGood luck; stay healthy. Keep your eyes open for a better job.\n\npowers\n\n"
