  "content": "Anyone can tell me _why_ the diaeresis/tréma/umlaut in the lower-case **ï** most of the time sits lower than the dot in the **i**? This puzzles many designers of Cyrillic typefaces. The thing is that in Ukrainian the combination of the **і** and the **ї** is quite common (e.g., _історії_, 'of the history'). The doubling of the **ї** is not unusual either (e.g., _її_, 'her/hers'). Any help would be much appreciated.\n\n",

In most typefaces the umlaut is in line with other accents.  \nThe i-dot may sit higher for aesthetic reasons, but I am not sure if this is a must. (I think Mr Gaultney raises the issue in his essay on diacritic design, and following it I have tried to drop the i-dot a bit but found the result unpleasing. At least in German, the combination of i and umlaut-letter doesn't occur often -- if at all.)\n\nKarsten\n\n"

      "content": "I can think of two possible reasons:  \n1) Since the tittle spans further left, it collides with the \"f\" more [often], so bringing it down helps.  \n2) Unless one makes the dots much smaller (which would cause a disturbance similar to the one caused by the height mismatch you mention/imply) they combine to have too much more presence than the single dot on the \"i\", so bringing them down makes them stand out less (see below).\n\n\\> The i-dot may sit higher for aesthetic reasons\n\nOr a functional one: since the dot is the main thing the \"i\"  \ncan contribute to readability, making it more prominent helps.  \nI've done that (as well as make it slightly \"too big\") in Patria.\n\nhhp\n\n"

For a language like English, of course, the dot on the i can be virtually any height, since there are almost no accent marks to be concerned with. But as soon as you have a language with a rich diacritical set you want the height of the dot on the i to be constrained to a reasonable height. In a typically proportioned text face, I usually align the top of the dot somewhere close to the cap height.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311054646im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Hicii.png)\n\n"

So that, compared with other accents, it (the dieresis) is not too heavy -- it has to have \"single accent\" weight, and not look like two 'i' dots.\n\n2. Because of the f, as Hrant says, but also because of ascenders that may follow, such as b, h, k and l.\n\nI line them up along the bottom, with the i dot.  \nI sometimes vary the width betwen the dots, depending on the width of the character.  \nA lot of little \"cheats\".\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311054646im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dies.jpg)\n\n"

Approaching diacritics a more systematic way is one consequence. Also the peculiar Czech caron comes to mind, or Ä Ö Ü with dropped umlaut (in German typefaces) which are just out of place in larger character sets.  \nAs regards your design samples, it is interesting that versals and ascenders are comparably small which doesn't leave much choice for placing accents.\n\n\"The doubling of the ї is not unusual either (e.g., її, ‘her/hers’).\"\n\nThis is good to know!\n\n"
