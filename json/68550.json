The way the animation rotated and the tree rings formed the letters just struck a chord in me.\n\nAND THEN THIS HAPPENED!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011091017im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MaplePictures_New_5998.jpg)\n\nWhat in the hell were they thinking? What does this say other than we typeset some letters and put a box around them?\n\nI have started this thread hoping to see you add other logos/branding that were redesigned so poorly that you're left wondering \"How did this happen?\"\n\nPepsi anyone?\n\n",

Just ridiculous.\n\nMastercard - WTF is with the magnifying glass cloudy gradient sphere?\n\nKraft - The DairyQueen 'designer' landed another client.\n\nThe Bank of New York - I loved the logo they had before — It's gorgeous. Sad they went with a sideways star trek badge after the merger.\n\n"
