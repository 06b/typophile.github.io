This is what I came with and I'm quite happy, but I would love to hear your comments about it. I'm making it freely available at [Daxion font at FontStruct](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417185152/http:/fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/daxion) and you can use it for commercial projects if you find its 178 characters suitable.  \nI hope you like it, cheers!\n\n",
