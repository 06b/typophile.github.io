      "content": "Its been a long time, I know. Anyway…&nbsp;they almost didn’t care how legible it was. The word doesn’t mean anything and it seems a little fashion upscale to have a logo that is curious at a glance, but obvious once you know the name. There are lots of fashion places that have names that are hard to read like Bvlgari and that Oprah logo is indiscernible but you know it is hers.\n\nThen again…&nbsp;they went out of business! Zoinks!\n\n"
