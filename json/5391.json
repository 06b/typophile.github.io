  "content": "Did you know that even guitar makers cared so much about letters?   \n   \nWe're making a custom bass guitar with an inlay in mother of pearl between the pickups on black. The inlay is in remembrance of the customer's mother, Kay. At first this didn't seem to be a difficult task, we inlay names all the time.   \n   \nBut Kay is especially difficult.   \n   \nAnything that looked \"pretty\" we encountered the descender of the y clashing with the K. Without any other contextual clues, many ideas looked like initials KAY.   \n   \nHere is the original concept:   \n   \n ![kay1](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39456.jpg)   \n#1   \nHe generally liked it, but wanted the letters more on a baseline. So we proposed:   \n   \n ![kay2](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39457.jpg)   \n#2   \nDidn't like the new y at all, but the rest he was satisfied with. So we tried a new one that he likes:   \n   \n ![kay3](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39458.jpg)   \n#3   \nBut now I need to make the final drawing for the inlay artist. Before I plunk a few hours into the artwork, I'm looking for any suggestions. I'm especially bothered by the large difference in the negative spaces between the letters. It especially shows up in a mock up with the materials:   \n   \n ![mockup](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39459.jpg)   \n   \nMany of the forms have to remain somewhat chunky to reduce the chance of snapping the shell while cutting with the saw. Ends can finish to a very sharp point, but a thin isthmus (like the bar on an A) is very fragile.\n\n",

      "content": "Mica, this is a fascinating process.   \n   \nFirst, some Suggestions: You may find that increasing the size of the A and Y helps generally. The other thing that I see, is that the Y doesn't really 'match'. Perhaps reshaping the Y would help. I would be tempted to try recalling the shape of the leg of the K or the bulgy left side of the A and applying it on the left arm of the Y or its tail. I also think that the A if made larger would create a nice spade shaped negative space with the foot of the K.   \n   \nBTW: you'll find faster uptake if you need input about specifics if you post in Critique, but this shows process a lot so the cross-over is natural.   \n   \nNow some Questions, if you have the time:   \nJust how large is a design like this? Must it fit between/in a fret (no I don't know the proper way to refer to this...) and just how wide is that? Do you have difficulty if a name or word exceeds a certain size i.e. William - would that have to be reduced to Will? Could you do William small enough to fit within a fret?   \n   \nYou mention that thin isthmus would present a problem, but sharp points are fine. Can you share the reason for this?   \n   \nI think the hand drawn curviness is neat, especially when I imagine it in the context of a curvy guitar. I like the hint of Rolling Stone.   \n   \nJon\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your input, Jon. The y has been the stumbling block on this project. None of us at the shop are happy with it either, so at least I'm glad to know we're not alone in our opinion. Back to the drawing board!   \n   \nThe Critique area seems more specifically gears toward font creation, and so I wasn't sure where it would fit in there, but yes, I notice that region gets alot more attention.   \n   \nThe design has to fit between the pickups on a bass guitar. It's sort of an unusual location. This area is about 2 inches high and 5 inches wide. It's placed under the strings where the player's right hand plucks the strings.   \n   \nDepending on where we put the inlay, there are limitations on size. A common place to put a decorative inlay is the 12th fret - it's the center of the string and marks the octave. It's a small space, typically only 5/8 x 2 inches on a guitar and 7/8 x 2-1/4 inches on a 4-string bass. You can't go to the edges, the designs look better with a buffer sround them. You have to consider where the string will fall once they're installed too.   \n   \nIf a name or other personalization would be too big to inlay, we engrave mother of pearl scrimshaw style. That allows finer detail than you can do in a regular inlay.   \n   \nThe sharp points aren't a problem since after we saw the inlay, it's filed smooth. You can do some amazing things with tiny files. Here's a picture of Mike filing a Roman numeral I:   \n   \n ![Mike files](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39558.jpg)   \n   \nThese are some of the Roman numeral inlays temporarily mounted before actually inlaying them in the fingerboard:   \n   \n ![golden mother of pearl r.n.](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39559.jpg)   \n   \nLittle thin places are prone to cracking. Either in sawing, filing, handling or glue-in. This is an example of one that cracked on installation:   \n   \n ![cracker](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39560.jpg)   \n   \nCan't win 'em all.\n\n"

Thanks for taking the time to photograph the work and sharing it here.   \n   \nThat's so much closer to sculpting type than a lot of modern typographers get.   \n   \nI see the break between the a and m.

What about the glue?   \n   \nI don't know why more people aren't swarming around here...this definitely has chirographic heritage but the cutting of the inlays and the fact that you embed letters into insturments is just so...so...well COOL...I love this.\n\n"

      "content": "Mica   \n   \nYour project is very appealing, both as a type project and an instrument.   \n   \nHave you tried: tilting the downstoke of the A just slightly off the vertical toward the Y and then swelling the downstroke of the Y to make more of a U shape. This would help to reduce the neg space between the two letters. I don't find the neg sapce between K and A to much.   \n   \nI am an amateur jazz cornet player, and I love working with wood, so I sort of fell into starting to build a steel string acoustic guitar. I don't know how to play the guitar, but I didn't see that as any reason not to make one. I will see if I can learn how to play basic rhythm once it's finished.   \n   \nMy point: you might consider getting your hands on a small pantographic engraving machine. The manual models are now quite cheap, since the industry is switching to computer assisted models.   \n   \nThe advantage to the pantograph is that you can work large to start. Your tight pencil drawing is photocopied into a good quality Strathmore 2-ply bristol, and you cut it out cleanly with a sharp X-Axto knife. You can save the negative area and this becomes the pattern fpr the sink that you will be cutting. Both parts are pasted to a thick matte board as separate pieces; positive and negative.   \n   \nThese two are traced witha stylus on the panto as whatever reduction you require, and you cut about 1/64\" in depth into a good rigid material like aluminum plate or some workable metal. This is the working pattern. You make a working pattern for both the sink and the inlay material. If you use the same sized cutter for both patterns, they will be very accurate and precise.   \n   \nOnce you have the two working patterns made, these fit onto the pantograph separately and you then make the sink in the guitar material, whether it's wood or phenolic or whatever. Next you angrave the inlay material using the same cutter and the fit is perfect.   \n   \nTo make it stable and unmoving the inlay material is glued to heavy laminated chipboard with white glue and left to dry a few hours. Ths piece goes on the panto for cutting.   \nWhen you are finsished you can lift the inlay by soaking until it releases from the cardboard material. If you want a little loosensess to the fit of the sink and the inlay this can be done by tweaking the size of the stylus that you use when cutting the sink, and the hole will come out a few thou, more open to let the inlay pop in so that it is not so tight as to crack when you are apressing it in.   \n   \nI've tried this with some rigid plstic in place of the abalone that I intend to use, and it cuts ok but it could be a little less gummy for better results. Pearl or abalone should cut very cleanly. With this method you can have considerably finer lines (the cross stroke in the A in KAY).   \n   \nYou will not lose the handmade feeling in you work by doing it this way, it will just give you work more refinement.   \n   \nIf this is not too nutty for you, email me and I will give you some leads on what to look for and where.   \n   \nBy the way; if you look up the ATypI 2004 on the web you will see a photospread that John Hudson did on my cutting of the keepsake for the Conf. This will give you some idea of the process if you are not familiar with it.   \n   \nI find it nice that so many of us do other things along with typography, and that makes this Forum so much more fun than simply talking shop.   \n   \nJim Rimmer\n\n"

In the case above, he decided it was so minor he wanted to keep it the way it was. That inlay is only about an inch across (and it's under the strings). Otherwise, it must be removed with a rotary cutter and a new inlay gets made. There can be casualties all along the way.   \n   \nWe almost always hand letter the designs. We might start with a font to get some general proportions, but since we're custom making everything, we figure even the lettering should be unique and reflect the individual we're making it for.   \n   \nThe most common inlay is initials. This is KP in Elvish:   \n   \n ![KP](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39768.jpg)   \nThe oval is a sterling silver wire and the letters are cut from mother of pearl.   \n   \nAnd in this design, the customer's initials DE were incorporated with a bass clef:   \n   \n ![DEdance](http://web.archive.org/web/20100305051150im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39769.jpg)   \nHe sent in a rough sketch of his idea, then we worked it to the final design. The oval is ebony with sterling silver wire. The bass clef is golden mother of pearl. The E and the stem of the D are black Tahitian mother of pearl.   \n   \nJust about everyone here is considered a designer. My mom, Susan, is the lead designer. On a given project, we toss around ideas until we figure who will be best suited to do the design, and to execute the inlay itself. I usually get type related projects since that's a special interest of mine.   \n   \nWe have been commissioned to exuecute other artist's designs, but we still need to adapt them to suit the medium.   \n   \nThanks again for the questions and suggestions.\n\n"
