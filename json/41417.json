The client is a little latte wagon that runs on electricity. Like a little moped/car that has a latte machine in the back... a very kool little thing. The client did not have a proper name for it yet. But i like the name OPEN COFFEE. The client said something like COFFEE 2 GO. But it was a bit too obvious I think. I dont want any clichés like the coffee mug etc or beans (for the symbol). Need more outside of the box than that i think. Its a very kool little coffe-car.\n\nBut i mostly need help with a SYMBOL. And no i dont want a vector image of the actuall car itself.\n\nThanks!\n\ndaniel\n\n [‹ Logo Critique: Static Soul Record Company](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152319/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45712 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [brushscript logo - where to from here? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152319/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46041 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
