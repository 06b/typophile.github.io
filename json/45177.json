At least until recently Dell and Apple used the same suppliers, so you were getting largely the \"same\" monitor for a big price differential - I assume that's still true, but haven't heard on that point lately.\n\nPersonally, I don't want to buy an external monitor whose resolution isn't at least equal to my laptop's built-in screen, so currently that's 1920x1200, which is what the particular Dell linked above has. But for now I'll stick to my old 1600x1200 CRT monitor. It works well enough I can't justify spending the money to replace it, even though a higher-res LCD screen would be HOTT.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Compared to plugging in an apple display. yikes.\n\nI brought my laptop to Future Shop yesterday and hooked it up, calibrated it as best I could, it was still over-saturated. It wasn't an Ultra Sharp, but I don't know about the Dell idea. Maybe you do get what you pay for, and after working on cinema displays this long, maybe I'll always be bugged by the differences. :(\n\nthanks everyone.\n\n"
