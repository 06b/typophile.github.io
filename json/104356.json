      "content": "There were MANY movies in that era -- many more than today, almost everyone went to the movies at least once a week [no TV] -- and almost all of them had hand lettered titles. Only a few have been digitized. A nice one in somewhat similar style to Bambi [but with a different B] is Mark Simonsen's [Lakeside](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016212552/http:/www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/lakeside), inspired by hand-lettered titles in Otto Preminger’s classic 1944 film noir movie “Laura.”  \nDon\n\n"
