      "content": "Well, it depends, what OS are you running? Using Geneva as a bitmap font is difficult, if not impossible, in Mac OS X, as it scales type using the PostScript outlines by default, and won’t allow you to use the bitmap font suitcase without its Postscript outline. If you have an older Mac running Mac OS 9.x or lower, you can just turn off Adobe’s ATM and scale the font to an appropriately large size and it’ll be plenty blocky. You don’t even need Photoshop: you can just use SimpleEdit and take a screen shot of the text once you have it entered the way you want. Indirect, but it’ll work.\n\nActually, that’s a good question: _does_ anyone know how to do this with Postscript fonts in Mac OS X? If nobody does, benski, and you don’t have Classic installed or an older version of Mac OS, you might need to get one of the new-school TrueType bitmap fonts, which are specially designed to look blocky.\n\n"
