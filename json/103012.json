There have been complaints about her practice of borrowing fonts from type designers without asking. One typophile writes: I have cracked open fonts she claims as hers, Bolero, Bickham and others, she has copied and pasted glyphs, copyright data, added Cyrillic and changed the copyright string.\n\nMore info: [http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-43962.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015181841/http:/luc.devroye.org/fonts-43962.html)\n\nIf you need to license the font for a project, I recommend to be extra careful and try to find if this is a rip-off of another commercial font before using it.\n\n------------------  \nI found it using \"Find my Font\": [http://www.findmyfont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015181841/http:/www.findmyfont.com/ \"http://www.findmyfont.com\")\n\n"
