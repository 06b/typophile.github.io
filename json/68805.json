  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm an illustration major working on my graduation project which is an illustrated biography of Jean-Francois Champollions (1790 – 1832), the decipherer of the Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nBeing an illustrator I'm sadly not very typography savvy so I could really use some help.\n\nThe text I'm working with is a mix of narrative and original letters so I'm looking for two fonts: a handwritten one I can use for the letters and a normal seriph-font for the narrative text, both with a sort of French early 19th century feel.\n\nSuggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

But a little search gave some interesting results:\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/serif\\_didone/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114053127/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/serif_didone/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/serif\\_didone/\")\n\nFor example, Didot LP by Letter Perfect and FF Cellini seem to be very appropriate.\n\n"
