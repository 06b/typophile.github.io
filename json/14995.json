  "content": "I recently presented a client with some initial concepts which were quite well received. However, we quickly got into the disucssion about ’appropriateness’ regarding a particular typeface. It’s an ultra-simple grid-based font.\n\nWe agreed that it would probably be more appropriate if the edges of the elements were not sharp...instead they should all be rounded.\n\nAnd so, I’m in a position to build a font that is clearly based upon something else, yet I’m making some small global changes. I don’t even own the face in question so there is no basis for me to copy their actual work...but I wonder if there is some etiquette regarding these kinds of things?\n\nAny tips?\n\nThanks...\n\n [‹ Old Church Slavonic Interlock](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109102603/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14377 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Boton ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109102603/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14999 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The client licenses the original foundries type properly, i.e. for the number of machines and locations as specified by the eula. 2. you customize it as the client wishes. 3. the client replaces the customized font into the same licensing “footprint” as the original font. 4. You don’t license the font to anyone else unless they have the same deal as the first client, and it’s not exclusive to that client, or you totally recreate the font from scratch, remaking all the contours, all spacing and tables as if it was new.\n\n"

If you are just doing a few words and not an actual font and the result will not be taken as the original you are probably OK. If you are making an entire font for sale competing with the original, it should be clearly enough different to not be taken as a rip off. If it must look just like the original with a few minor changes, ask the designer to do it for you or give you permission to do it your self.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

The designer in question talks about where his inspiration originated (other fonts). Perhaps it’s a completely stupid question...\n\nSo, is there some etiquette that typographers (I’m a designer of 10 years but not a traditional typographer) use in these instances? Are there some generic rules?\n\nThe new font that I will likely be creating is unique enough...will not be for sale (unless somebody wants to handle that for me - too busy)...and is only based up the inspiration of another face.\n\nPerhaps Arial should have referred to Helvetica or Grotesque, but it didn’t.

Giving clients too much information can sometimes muddy the waters of simplicity.\n\nSo, you don’t have the typeface, but you did use it? How did you use it?
