      "content": "And the fact is that I made this font in 2004. It sort of ended on a slow burner, when I got to 35000 kerning pairs, and FontLab caved in. It tried different methods, but FontLab refused to produce an OT font.\n\nIn the end, I had to remove most of the kerning pairs, and hope that people don’t mind kerning by hand. I’ve already given Suomi Script for free to some that had been asking for it, and that is fine by me; they can use it.\n\nSuomi Script was a study of OpenType possibilities, and I found the limit in kerning.\n\nI could go and buy the program Tal Leming made, but for just this it’s too expensive. And it might not work for this font.\n\n"
