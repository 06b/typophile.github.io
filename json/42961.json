I’ve never designed a typeface before so, I’m not sure where to begin. Do I scan the letters in and import the file to something like fontlab or do I redraw each letter in Illustrator? Is there a common practice or any tips you could give a beginner?\n\nThank you.  \nRoger\n\n [‹ Weekend in Lisboa (Portugal)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025044458/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42991 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Last in the alphabet but 1st in our hearts, Happy B-Day, Zara! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025044458/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42887 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "All the nodes and control points in digital fonts are on a fine grid of “units per em” (UPM). This means that curves drawn in a normal vector drawing program and then imported into a font program will be approximated just a bit sloppily. This won’t make much difference in a handwriting font, but it’s a real nuisance for more precise designs. So it’s best that you learn to use the drawing tools in your font software. Scan your sample and import the bitmap of each letter as a guide for you to trace.\n\n"
