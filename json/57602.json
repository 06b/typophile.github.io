I agree about the Clarendon serif, but there is such a large number of Clarendon's that isolating the specific one is probably not worth the trouble.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "\"I always thought that obliqued was the same as italics\"\n\nIn some fonts obliqued is sometimes called \"italics\", but in true italics the letters are not just slanted, they also have different shapes. Often the a, e, f and g (among others) are different in the italic than the slanted Roman letter would be.\n\nThe example attached is a serif font sample (Mikaway), but the same applies in Sans Serif fonts. It's true that more sans serif faces use and obliqued Roman as their \"italic\", but many do not.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120718185301im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mikaway_full_5022.gif)\n\n"
