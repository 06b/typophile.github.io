      "content": "I had a bit more time to check on the constraints on the consonants that can precede eth. In modern Icelandic, by far the consonant that most frequently precedes eth is “r”, as “rð” is a very common combination. You also find “f” and “g” in front of eth in some words, but other consonants seem to be rare.\n\nIn Old Norse, you find many more different consonants preceding eth. I just checked a single Old Norse text, the _[Gylfaginning](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103033318/http:/www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Gylfaginning)_, and came up with the following in addition to “rð”, “fð”, and “gð”:\n\n“kð” as in “þökð”  \n“lð” as in “dvalðist”  \n“mð” as in “ósæmð”  \n“nð” as in “leynð”  \n“pð” as in “steypðist”\n\nThe eth is usually replaced in modern Icelandic spelling for these words.\n\nI also checked the text of _[Beowulf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103033318/http:/en.wikisource.org/wiki/Beowulf)_ and found 100+ instances of “rð” as well as:\n\n“cð” as in “brecða”  \n“fð” as in “Gifðum”  \n“gð” as in “mægð”  \n“hð” as in “fǣhð”  \na text fragment containing “lð”  \n“mð” as in “nymðe”  \n“nð” as in “cēnðu”\n\nAlso, don’t forget that in all these languages (modern Icelandic, Old Norse, and Old English) “y” is a vowel and that it also commonly precedes eth.\n\n"

Yes, even the dreaded “fð” exists :-)\n\n"

Otherwise, as Nina suggested, because many words begin or end with thorn and many words end with eth, these kinds of combinations are quite common.\n\n"
