  "content": "does anyone have any advice for rasterizing type - especially small type, but any type really - for sceen (web) use?   \ni'm creating the images and type in illustrator, and then either \"saving for web\" or outputting a tiff and funking with that in photoshop. neither have really proved satisfactory - antialiasing is too fuzzy, or just not quite on point.   \ni suppose i could work only in photoshop, but im far more comfortable laying out type and such in illustrator, asi i spose i should be.   \n   \nthanks in advance.   \n   \nben   \n   \noh. see the type at [www.theeaves.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526122341/http:/www.theeaves.com/) for example of obnoxious rasterizing for screen. small type is getting lost, or fuzzed. blech.\n\n",
