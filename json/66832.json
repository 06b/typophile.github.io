  "content": "Hey guys, making an old logo vector. Was just hoping for a little verification on weights and possibly even fonts if I'm off.\n\nTrinity Community appears to be Adobe Garamond Pro with small caps. I'm not positive on the weight though. Nothing seems to be right on and I'm assuming that's just because I haven't begun the squashing process as it looks like both fonts have been squashed flat.\n\nI believe Ministries is just Futura extra bold with the same squashing as Trinity which is why letters may be a bit off.\n\nAny other ideas out there?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 4.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204043059/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%204_64.png) | 35.45 KB |\n\n",

So, thanks again!\n\nIt makes me sad that I have to sqoosh these fonts. A little piece of me is dying on this project.\n\n"
