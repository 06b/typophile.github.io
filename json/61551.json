  "content": "Indento is a multi-purpose modern geometric slab serif for headlines, posters, branding but fairly legible to be used as longer text. The straight and rounded corners combined with deep cuts and asymmetric serifs gives it a distinctive look while still keeping its rigorousness and legibility.\n\nThe family consist of three weights, each with a companying italic. The extensive character set—513 glyphs in each font—includes support for Central and Eastern European languages and OpenType features like small caps, ligatures, fractions, slashed zero, stylistic alternates and more. See [PDF specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20121001003048/http:/mugurmihai.com/pdf023/Indento.pdf).\n\nAvailable for purchase at [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20121001003048/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/mugur-mihai/indento/). Make sure you try the free bold version.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121001003048im_/http:/typophile.com/files/indento-gallery1_6066.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121001003048im_/http:/typophile.com/files/indento-gallery2_6502.jpg)\n\n",
