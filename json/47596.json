  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have been working on this set of letters for the logotype for a client. The letters were created in illustrator. The type will go along with a yet to be determined mark. They are very happy with how it looks so far, but I was wondering if there were any ways that I could make it better, improve it?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013063833im_/http:/typophile.com/files/overtypo_5554.png)\n\nI would love any feedback, comments or opinions.

Actually \"a\" differs too much from other letters style too much.\n\nRegarding the \"m\". I'd keep the first one but make it narrower. But just enough. You don't want it squashed and you don't want it too wide either (the way it's now. But as said I would keep the first design. Looks much better and it also matches \"v\" and matches other letters' style better.\n\n\"h\" is too narrow compared to \"u\". \"r\" is MAYBE a very small bit too wide. \"o\" is almost definitely too wide.\n\nAlso \"stabilise\" \"e\" a bit more at the bottom, because it looks a bit too much off and is falling.\n\nWhen changing \"a\" I would suggest you make the top and bottom match, but try making the middle line horizontal.\n\nThese are my suggestions.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

Although I am not a fan of how the 'a' looks with a middle horizontal line I really appreciate your comment on how to construct it using the 'e' as it give me some ideas which I quite like in the third version below. The 'h' was obviously too narrow, thanks for spotting that.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013063833im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo33_6579.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Your letters are waaay too tight. au is almost moulded together... \"h\" is probably much better but it's hard to tell since \"u\" is too close to \"a\". And maybe to \"l\" as well.\n\n\"m\" looks too much like golden arches. You'll have to make inner lines inside it a bit more steep (different angle than outer ones). It will still have correct style but its own distinct look (not recognisable by hamburger fans)...\n\nI like the middle \"a\" but upper line is too short and doesn't reflect the style of \"e\" enough. But it has exactly what I wanted to see: top and bottom line angle match. I like it but I may not be the best judge for it since it was something I wanted to see.\n\nCan't say about the \"o\". Too tight letterspacing and no small size. But it may still be just a little bit too wide.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

Great improvements, but I want to comment on the 'm'.  \nIn comparisson to the rest the 'v'-style bothers me. You don't see this anywhere else.  \nI looks like it doesn't belong there.\n\nYou have an open type and at the 'm' it gets too tight. To me that is a big contrast not fit for the rest.\n\nOtherwise, great type. Are you planning of making an actual font out of this?\n\nRay\n\n"
