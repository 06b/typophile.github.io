I have been looking for a font that goes with modern typographic trends in webdesign BUT it’s not sans-serif. It has to be clean, non-traditionalm, web 2.0 :D serif font.\n\nI really love [**Morgan Avec**](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929040446/http:/www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=15), Precious and basically this kind of serif fonts, but I was wondering if you know some alternatives. It doesn’t have to be exactly the same style - just something display / web friendly and of course good lookin’.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\ngonee\n\n [‹ Travel Iconography](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929040446/http:/typophile.com/node/49925 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What typefaces are this two ? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929040446/http:/typophile.com/node/49906 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
