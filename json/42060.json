They do seem like a great tool for generating consistent contrasts and making it possible to test a typeface’s color at dozens of weights before committing to anything.\n\nHas anyone had the chance to try them out? I’m on CS3, so I haven’t been able to try LivePen, and Kalliculator is yet to be released.\n\n [‹ Textbook design: dimensions](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905211008/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41974 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [using graphology on typography ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905211008/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41917 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
