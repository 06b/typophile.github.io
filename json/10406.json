  "content": "Why is Linotype claiming ownership of Eurostile and filing trademark applications when it is in the public domain?   \n   \nFollowing are Adobe's notes on Eurostile   \n   \nTypeface notes:   \nIn 1952, Aldo Novarese and A. Butti designed Microgramma for the Nebiolo foundry. It was a popular face, but was available only in capitals. In 1962, Novarese produced a full character set, including lowercase letters, and the foundry renamed the family Eurostile. The letters are square-shaped with rounded corners, producing a look reminiscent of the machinery, technology, and interior design of the 1950s.   \nDesigners:   \nA. Butti   \nAldo Novarese   \nEurostile is a trademark of Nebiolo.\n\n",

A trademark can be judged to have entered the public domain if it has become a generic term and has not been legally defended by a company claiming the trademark. But if a company ceases to exist or simply neglects its trademarks, it is possible for another company to try to register that trademark. The application can be challenged by other companies, or by individuals if they believe that the name has become a generic term.   \n   \n   \nHabemus papam!\n\n"
