  "content": "Hi All\n\nLike it says, I think this font is quite like DIN, although each line ends in a semicircle instead of the sharp 90 degrees end DIN has. Can anyone ID this for me? If there's something similar that's free I will be very happy. Thanks a bunch!\n\nBT\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2013-04-30 at 3.17.09 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130526012027/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-30%20at%203.17.09%20PM.png) | 21.73 KB |\n\n",
