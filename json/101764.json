  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm doing some research into how to compare two typefaces for similarity. So far, I've come up with the list below - like a checklist for comparing two fonts. I'd say I'm missing a lot of good measures. Are there any others I should include?\n\n- serif style\n- single versus double sided\n- symmetrical or asymmetrical\n- bracketed or not\n- x-height\n- terminal style\n- aperture size\n- axis\n- single vs double \"a\"\n- binocular vs monocular \"g\"\n- proportion of the bowl of an \"R\" to its legs\n- roundness of round shapes\n- shape and size of \"i\" dot\n\nThanks,  \nAaron\n\n",
