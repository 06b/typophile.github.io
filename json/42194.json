It’s usually because their message is not original and the design is not original. Hopefully someone in this field of work can come up with a creative shirt to do with kerning, lorem ipsum, wingbats, or something that looks like a stylish tee for a typophile.\n\n [‹ Whitman Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20080320064334/http:/typophile.com/node/42142 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Another nice Mexican Blackletter example ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080320064334/http:/typophile.com/node/42192 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
