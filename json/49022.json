  "content": "Hello, this is my first post.\n\nI want to go to a short design course in the Netherlands [short: one-two months, if it's more I don't care] , doesn't have to be about typography, but printed media in general.\n\nAfter looking for this kind of short courses for several weeks, I feel a little lost. Just couldn't find anything, just master studies.\n\nI have looked at Utrecht school of arts, KABK, ArtEZ, etc. Im looking for something not too formal, want to experiment. There's a school in Barcelona [www.tenemosunplan.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161051/http:/www.tenemosunplan.com/ \"www.tenemosunplan.com\") . I'm looking for something like that -lots of practice-\n\nSo the question is: Do you know any academy, school, university... offering this kind of courses? [can be anywhere in the Netherlands, small or big institutions, whatever! :)]\n\nThank you all in advance.\n\n",
