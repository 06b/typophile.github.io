  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m interested in [Storm](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Storm%20Type%20Foundry)’s John Baskerville, but I’m a bit confused about the various fonts in the family. It seems that John Baskerville is for type 11pt and up and Baskerville Ten is for type 10pt and smaller, but where do John Baskerville Text and John Baskerville Tx N fit in? John Baskerville Text looks very similar to Baskerville Ten, but they don’t seem to be identical. I have no idea what Tx N means.\n\nThanks\n\n",
