I don't visit here often, but the few times I've scanned this forum and posted questions, I've been in awe of the expertise here.\n\nI'm a graphic designer and I spend more time on another professional forum that has spoiled me with fast responses to my posts.\n\nMay I direct traffic to my query in the Design section? I'm OCD and I'm wearing out the refresh button. If this is bad form, please smack me and I won't do it again. Thank you!\n\n",
