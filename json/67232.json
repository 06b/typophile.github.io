Sommet Slab features a tall x-height, and its letterforms are compact, perfect for when layout space is at a premium. Over twenty OpenType alternate characters are available, including friendlier upright italic forms, and a unique simplified lowercase. Sommet Slab also includes oldstyle figures and small caps.\n\nUse Sommet Slab whenever you need a powerful and contemporary slab-serif.\n\n",
