The samples I was looking at were heavier weights and the arms of the ’k’ meet at the stem, but then I looked at the [lightest weight of Avant Garde Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103857/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/extra-light/testdrive.html?s=Patrick+Norguet&p=60) and there was the right ’k’.\n\nGood call. Sorry for doubting you ;-)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
