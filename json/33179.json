That leads me to believe its a poor knock-off off another font.\n\nDiva appears to be the one that has been knocked off. Though diva is a little thinker than the example I have.

      "content": "Just a word about Miss Brooks. It is NOT a knockoff of anything. It was one of [Mike Allard’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20070714133818/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/denada/dn1.htm) shareware creations. All of his fonts were revivals of old typefaces. He did this in the very early days of font digitization, though, and the quality is, indeed, poor.\n\nAlso, he originally created these fonts on a Mac and not only refused to make PC versions, but forbade anyone else from doing so. Of course, like many things with computers and online, that was not controllable. As a result, most of his fonts that you find today are old, unauthorized PC conversions - and that may also account for part of the lack of quality.\n\nIf you decide to purchase one of the other versions, Joshua, I might mention that Mary Monroe was made by David Rakowski. He was a putting out fonts (including lots of shareware) at the same time as Mike Allard and he’s had nothing to do with fonts for many years. So Mary Monroe may very well be as crude as Miss Brooks. Also, Petzendorfer shows that Manuscript had two M’s. It appears that none of these versions has both (it’s especially strange that Rebecca Alaccari didn’t include the alternate in one of the Diva fonts) - so that might be a factor in which font you opt for.\n\n"
