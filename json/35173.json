I look back on work that I did 5 years ago and wonder what I was thinking when I picked some of the faces I used. (Be it financial limitations, skill or understanding.)\n\nSo, I’ll go with a few that I enjoy using more often than others (as of late):\n\n1. Meta  \n2. Emigre’s Brothers  \n3. Helvetica  \n4. Myriad Pro  \n5. Farnham\n\nI don’t use very many serifed fonts. Mainly because I don’t feel confident in picking them.\n\n"

I even became quite cosy with Helvetica for a while in the mid ’80s.\n\nIn some ways it’s like the repertoire of classical music. There was one pianist who was 30ish, and “saving Beethoven for later” (maybe I got the instrument and the composer wrong, but you get the idea).\n\nFrom a type designer’s perspective, many of us take a crack at the classics, doing “our” version of Jenson or whatever. Jenson, Bodoni, Garamond — those seem to be the “essentials” for reviving, and for using no doubt. So I would say, if you’re going to get involved with one of those hoary old faces, why not work with a few variations — including present day interpretations — to really get the feel of the thing.\n\n"
