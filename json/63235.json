      "content": "What’s your budget?  \nWho’s your audience?  \nWhat is the newspaper writing about?\n\nFor basic text work you’ll need a family with minimum regular, italic, bold. I recommend a typeface with small caps and both old style figures and lining figures. I’d consider adding a medium and and a demi bold (slightly darker than the bold weight) as well, for setting white text on coloured background, and smaller text like footnotes, sidenotes captions and such. Another option is a text family with optical sizes.  \nTransitional typefaces are quite common in news design. They are less quiet than old style serifs (mainly used for books). Newsprint is rather dodgy, so you’ll need something that can handle ink spread and poor paper.\n\nHere’s a few contemporary suggestions:\n\n• [Newzald](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201095637/http:/www.vllg.com/KLIM/Newzald/mudTyper+Weights/) by Kris Sowersby  \n• [Freight](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201095637/http:/www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens.html?key=bannerfam&thename=Freight&link=T&formsubmit=T) by Joshua Darden  \n• [Farnham](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201095637/http:/www.fontbureau.com/newspaper/fonts/Farnham) by Christian Schwartz  \n• [FF Tisa](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201095637/http:/mitja-m.com/type/FF_Tisa.htm) by Mitja Miklavčič  \n• [Galaxie Copernicus](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201095637/http:/www.vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCopernicus/mudTyper+Weights/) by Chester Jenkins and Kris Sowersby\n\nFor display you need something that can offer more punch. Perhaps a sans serif design — minimum light/regular/black(or bold) — or a serif design with a lot of contrast between horisontals and verticals. Depending on the content/format you might need narrow versions of the headline fonts. The display fonts will be your main tool for setting the tone of your newspaper. It can be whimsical, serious, trendy +++, depending on your audience.  \nI’d consider pairing a sans and a serif with similar skeleton to allow for variations.\n\n"
