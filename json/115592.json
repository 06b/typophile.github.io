Grocers Script says it was discovered on the market Cours Saleya in Nice and was Designed in 2004 according to MyFonts where as the Castcraft/OPTI version says Copyright 1990-1991. I wonder what the real source of this typeface is.\n\n"

      "content": "Lots of similarities between Gert Wiescher's Grocers Script, based on lettering in a market in Nice, OPTI Morgan Fifty Nine, and Graphic Stylin NF. The clue to the reason for the similarities is that like Nick's Graphic Stylin the other two fonts seem to be also derived from the Inserat Cursive script of the late 19th century. Many of the alphabets of that era were published in showcard lettering sheets and books. In some way or another at least some of the design apparently filtered down to Gert's grocer in Nice. OPTI Morgan Fifty Nine is probably based on a printed alphabet or perhaps even a type specimen. Interesting.  \nSo, the real source of this batch of fonts probably lies with whomever designed Inserat Cursive.  \nBut then again, I could be wrong and the close similarities are purely coincidence...  \nDon\n\n"
