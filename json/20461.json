FL offers more than one way to put together a MM font; hopefully these will all produce a reliable source for generating instances.\n\nSince the issue here is the kerning data, when you blend the fonts, do any of them have kerning? If so, do the pairs ’overlap’? (Meaning, a given pair exists in both fonts)\n\nWhen you open a Metrics Window, you should be able to see the various kerning values for each master. Do they look alright?\n\nI’m using FL 5.0.2 Mac, and from the tests I’ve done with a 2-axis (4 masters) font, I had no problems. No pairs were dropped or added, and the kerning was interpolated.\n\n"
