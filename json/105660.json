  "content": "So I am creating this logo for a customer and it is based on a custom typeface I have designed for myself for use in my work. So when i create the final logo type using that typeface, will I be able to transfer the copyright of the logo(only the logotype, as a standalone piece of design) to the customer. I am asking this because typefaces aren't copyrightable in the US and i dont want the customer to end up with a logo that they don't even own full copyright to.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n",
