  "content": "I need suggestions for a modern font for a business magazine masthead. The magazine profiles successful local businesses and is distributed to business people.\n\nThe masthead consists of two words stacked together on top of the word BUSINESS. The letter S appears numerous times in all three words.\n\nWe are currently considering either Gotham Book or Eurostile. Any suggestions of alternatives and also a body copy font that matches would be greatly appreciated. I'll post a reply with the fonts we go with.\n\n",
