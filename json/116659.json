In the 7os, custom messages on T-shirts were most often produced with iron-on letters designed and made for that purpose. They weren't copied from any specific font designed for typesetting, although they often resembled workhorse bold sans-serifs like Franklin Gothic.\n\n"

I've seen a few on line with names like \"Hockey font\", \"Rock It,\" and on this thread [http://typophile.com/node/80815](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725092250/http:/typophile.com/node/80815 \"http://typophile.com/node/80815\") but there are a few characters on the shirts which I can't find anything like (e.g. R, #, &). I'm still hoping.\n\n"
