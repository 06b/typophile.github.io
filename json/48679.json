So I suppose my question is: How do you know that your design, something you may indeed spend years developing, is original, or at least different enough from what’s out there? It seems impossible to be aware of ALL typefaces out there. The good ones, yes that’s possible, but there must be unknown type designers out there doing fantastic work.\n\n [‹ Where do I get a halftone dot pattern vector that looks like the dot pattern on the Great Seal on the back of a one dollar bill?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121191942/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48822 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Comping Foil Stamping? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121191942/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48377 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Hi There\n\nIt is hard to be original.\n\nWhat I always try to do is design a concept first and then the actual design.  \nEverything you do has been done before by an other. Being 100% original is impossible.  \nYou could try, but it is hard.\n\nIt is no shame looking around for inspiration. But, be aware of copying.  \nIf things have no purpose, just leave them out.\n\nI a way trends are an example of this. Light letters, gradients ... you see them around.  \nAre you less original when using that? I think it is about communication.  \nWhat is it you want to communicate.\n\nIf you can start a trend, I think you are original. Even though the actual trend has been done before.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n"

That’s also when I stopped being a fan.\n\nAfter that I was not interested what other musicians were up to, especially those that were doing something close to what I was trying to do.\n\nBeing a primarily an ear-trained musician means that whatever I hear, I play. So I have to be really careful not to get poisoned.\n\npbc\n\n"

I suppose it is easier if you only design type and do no graphic design. But I stopped doing graphic design years ago, so I have no need or desire to look at other contemporary work,\n\nJames\n\n"

It looks to me like “Dax meets DIN in a Rapidograph template”. That’s a sufficiently original concept, if drawn out the way Daniel Utz has done it, with his own taste in the proportions of the letters, the quality of the curves, and the “speed” they transition into the straights. Then there is the question of fit, determined by the width of sidebearings among other things.\n\n"

If you’re going to do that, best to avoid Jenson and Griffo.\n\n"
