I think there's another forum on this topic that suggested Akzidenz Grotesk as being a likely candidate, however, they didn't arrive at any solid conclusions and I'm adamant that someone out there knows! Such is my curiosity that I've created an outlined vector file showing the differences that are most apparent to me.\n\nAnyways,  \nThanks for your help!\n\n",

      "content": "When i have a look at this it appears to be a phototype version of the Akzidenz Grotesk. This means, that i don’t think it’s possible to reproduce it with a vector font. Probably it was done with a “duck-shooter” or Diatype (1960) from Berthold. That would explain why the letters don’t look like todays Akzidenz.\n\nIt is not likely to be a “Shelter Grotesk NF” because it is not that geometric and the /C doesn’t close that much. With “Hass Grotesk” i believe you refer to the “Alte Haas Grotesk”, if so, that is highly unlikely because the “Alte Haas Grotesk” later redesigned and known as Helvetica always ends its strokes with horizontal endings. The “Royal Grotesk” would be entirely possible but it is just an alternated Akzidenz released in 2009, probably made by an older copy of the Akzidenz Grotesk.\n\nhope that helped you solving your problem\n\nbest regards\n\n"

      "content": "In some cases the Starsettograph / Starograph / Staromat-Versions of Berthold typefaces differ from the Diatype version.  \nAccording to Wikipedia, the film [To Kill a Mockingbird](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414033531/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fen.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_%28film%29) is from 1962 and it has been produced in the US. The first Diatype was sold in 1960 but I wonder if Berthold had been selling these in the US as early as 1962. The first Starsettograph, as produced by Film-Klischee GmbH before they were bought by Berthold is from 1961.  \nMy conclusion: Akzidenz Grotesk: yes, Diatype: no, Starsettograph: unlikely …\n\n"

      "content": "Exactly my point. Those versions all differ from each other.  \nI was just searching for phototype machines and the first one of Berthold the Diatype happened to be somewhere around the release of the movie in 1962. That was more of an assumption than a conclusion i uttered there.  \nIsn’t there some kind of website, that shows the evolution process most of the popular typefaces went through?  \nSomething like a history book of type =)\n\nbest regards\n\n"
