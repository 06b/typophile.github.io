  "content": "Hey everyone! I thank you in advance.\n\nI'm designing a logotype for a local jeweler. His previous identity was old english/blackletter typography of his name 'Mathew'. After a brief with him, we decided to keep some of the style of the logo, in particular, the authoritative/established look and feel that blackletter typography represents to him. (trust me I tried to stray away, however without any success). Another thing he wanted, since he loves old school art & design, is a mixture of what he had with a modern AND retro touch. Quite a hard task.\n\nSo what I'm doing is designing custom letters with a hint of blackletter and retro inspiration. Please feel free to rip this up as its the first draft and the first time I try to design letters from scratch with such a broad design range.\n\nThank you,  \nJonE.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Untitled-2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130318002239/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-2_12.jpg) | 20.86 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Yes, perhaps. However I'm always concerned with readability when it comes to ambigrams. Actually I'm concerned with the letterforms working as they are now...maybe after they are fully completed I can try the ambigram.  \nIt came out this way because I started with the 'a' and designed the other letterforms based on the 'a'. Is this the appropriate way to design letters?\n\nJonE.\n\n"
