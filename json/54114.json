The focus is on the stress, stroke, and serif of each individual letter, all of which contribute to the overall look, personality, and readability of the typeface.\n\nThe typeface used was Times STD.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TodocaPorterFittsZimmerman.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417112629/http:/typophile.com/files/TodocaPorterFittsZimmerman.pdf) | 441.59 KB |\n\n",
