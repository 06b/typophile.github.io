(gotham/universe). im trying to avoid futura and century gothic just because of their common appearance in my work. and no helvetica...\n\n",

But play with color, weight, texture, harmony and movement!\n\nSorry but I thought maybe you were open to suggestion as opposed to what you think the teacher expects or what has been jammed down your throat. If SANS is the end all then I am way too far gone. Serif, on its face, is not a riot! Especially if it is gently paired with a Sans. See Bringhurst!\n\nDuh da ta duh duh ta duh da duh da duh da, God save the serif! And its ability to make the Sans sparkle.\n\nThirty years is enough. I am going into the recycling business.\n\nSerifs for a tuppence (sp.)\n\nMore please!\n\n"
