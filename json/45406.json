He told me one of the most important criteria the MATD steering committee is looking for in people applying to enter the MATD is intellectual curiosity. I tried to fit as much of my past few years of work into my portfolio: apparently it worked!\n\n"

People tend to leave these projects out of their portfolios because they're not the glamourous jobs, but at Reading you will be expected to design a typeface that works in text, so the ability to handle text typography is a plus. Good luck Eben.\n\n"

At least I have the InD files...\n\n"
