  "content": "I'm a veteran type designer (early T-26 fonts) wanting to explore OpenType for converting my older Type-1 fonts. I'm intrigued by the FDK, but the worst part is installing it on my new 17\" FP iMac (Jaguar). All of Adobe's docs seem dated (older python on OS9) or just plain confusing.   \n   \nI can get MakeOTF.py (-n) to run from a command line, but I can't figure out where to locate the necessary files nor tell MakeOTF.py where to look for them.   \n   \nIf anyone has any words of wisdom on how to get up and running, I'd be forever grateful.\n\n",
