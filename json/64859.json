I just tried to open my Font Book and mine won't open at all (hence my Googling \"Font Book Won't Open\" -- which is how I found you).\n\nI would have thought Font Book was a standalone app but this is a curious coincidence.\n\nI did try a restart but it didn't help.\n\nI hope you get a better response than mine.\n\n"
