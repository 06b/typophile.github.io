For a time, Albertus was the most   \nubiquitous display typeface in England, and in 1988 was used by the City of   \nLondon on all street signs. Wolpe is also credited with designing the   \nHyperion and Tempest typefaces.   \n   \nA dynamic speaker, Greer Allen has designed publications for Colonial   \nWilliamsburg, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago,   \nStorm King Art Center, and many other libraries and museums.
