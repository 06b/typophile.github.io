  "content": "Happy Holidays Typophiles.   \n   \nHere is the project that has gobbled all my spare time of late. First, let me say, _this is not a revival_. If you are looking for a proper revival, Bruce Rogers and Robert Slimbach have done nicely. This is me fiddling with Jenson. To be sure it has some venetian overtones, but is unapologeticly streamlined, most notably in the joins and serifs. I had a bit of fun with the f ligatures. They reference Jenson directly in a way I had not seen before, but still (i hope) subtle enough so modern readers don't hiccup. Italics are anybody's guess. Here, I just started drawing (my first true italics). Some of these will surely need revision. They are not overly narrow (a trait I find annoying). The color between the uppers, lowers, small cap and italics is very close. Another Jenson diversion is the short cap height. Numerals are straight ahead (more variations to follow)   \n   \nCurious to hear your reactions. Currently the font is outlines only. I will begin creating the font and get you a text setting shortly.   \n   \nCheers!   \nRandy   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417092231im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22065.gif)\n\n",

Do you think the open waist accentuates the issue? I debated about this characteristic, and decided to leave it in all the caps (A,B.P,R).   \n   \nDrawing in Illustrator has advantages. The largest being the ability to have uppers, lowers, smallcaps, and italics all in the same document for comparison. FontLab and Fontographer both feel like I'm working too isolated. It's not so easy to drop some italics in between the regulars to check color etc. If course, it adds the step of having to check over the contours after importing.   \n   \nZero: Yeah, now that I look, even ciphers have slight optical compensation.   \n   \ny: A stonger tail would be better, i agree.   \n   \nI'll have to mull over the other suggestions   \n   \nThanks,   \nRandy   \n   \nForgot to add: About the dark color. We will have to wait and see how it looks in a text setting. I did make it a bit darker on purpose. I think a light version somewhere between a \\*normal\\* roman and light could also be nice, the that is a daydream right now.\n\n"

The asymmetry of the 'N' works really well, and the 'T' looks really powerful, like a strongman holding weights at arms length. I don't mind the 'g' and I love the lc 'z'.   \n   \nI agree with Hrant about the 'y' and the 'K', I also think the beak of the 'r' looks too short, and maybe too sharp/angular.   \n   \nThe new 'R' is a definite improvement.

What will probably end up happening is there will be a text version (steming from \\*book\\*), and a display version (a modified \\*roman\\*). As it stands now, it didnt' make sense to call the roman display because i'd need to thin out the serifs and generally make it more delicate. I was motivated to do the text/book version because when I was printing text samples at smaller sizes 6-11 pt some of the defining details were fading. The top serifs for example, it wasn't clear that they weren't the triangular bracketed veriety found in most venetian oldstyles, so i deepened the cut. Certain joins needed to be reworked so I added trapping, and in some cases (the r, n, m etc) altered the stem (made it vertical) as well to open things up.   \n   \nThe resulting text is crispier. And more characteristic of what I wanted. I think the confusion will go away when I call them text and display.

(Probably where evolve comes from)   \n   \nOf those I like: the Novo prefix (Nova Jenson), Farrago, Tempero, Tractus, Proficio, and Recipero. But, after a while they all start sounding like spells and potions from a Harry Potter book. Good ideas though. Any favorites from that group?   \n   \nTwo more:   \ndenuo : anew, again, a second time, afresh.   \nnovitas : newness, novelty, strangeness\n\n"

Of the latin ones, I'd rework the spelling on some: Farrego, Proficia.   \n   \nOld world sounding names I'm considering: Veneto, Bartolomeo, Lucera, Bergamo, Marsanne, Dolcetto.   \n   \nBergamo has the most defining set of letters.
