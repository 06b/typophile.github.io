I don't know how you get it, but it's a stunning piece of historical work, very well illustrated, and in English too.\n\n"

Best bet would be to contact Tom Phinney or David Lemon directly.\n\nRick, to increase your chances of snagging a copy you could ask them for a copy for your school library.\n\n"
