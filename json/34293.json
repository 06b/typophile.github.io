The page turned gradually from the bottom right corner until you had moved the cursor to the left side then the page would gently fall and the next page was gradually reveal. Brilliant. Not incredibly intuitive but extremely rewarding. The site doesn’t exist anymore, has anyone seen this effect somewhere else by any chance?\n\n"

Look at any retail store that has a weekly circular...they’ll often post their ad as a ’flippable’ flash file. It was cool the first time I saw it years ago, and even then only for a few minutes. Now it’s just inane. If I want to flip pages, I’ll pick up that magazine on the table thank-you-very-much. ;o)\n\n"
