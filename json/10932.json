  "content": "This not very pleasant typeface is used in an altar missal published by Benziger Brothers Inc. around 1956 (the book has no publication date, but Cardinal Spellman's introduction is dated the feast of St Basil the Great, 1956). The type is used in two sizes 14pt (shown here) and 12pt. A different typeface is used for italics, suggesting that this face might not have an italic. Anyone recognise it?   \n   \n ![Missale Romanum 14pt](http://web.archive.org/web/20071209111912im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8547.jpg)\n\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; Zinfandel - Handle Oldstyle {Stephen, Chesh}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071209111912/http:/www.typophile.com/node/10935 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#40;x&#41; Layers working together - Univers Cond {Nicolai Kruse} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071209111912/http:/www.typophile.com/node/10942 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

These were known as romanisch, romisch, romaans in European enboldened renditions. Very late nineteenth century.   \n   \nDe Vinne No. 11 is very similar except the lowercase c shown here is wrong and, interestingly, wrong for the face.   \n   \nIs this a pop quiz? or?\n\n"

There were a lot of variants to his \"family.\" This is not De Vinne No. 11. Thought I said that. We don't have really good records of specimens and their positioning during this very exciting period of printing history.   \n   \nDe Vinne is important because he was a printer with scholarly interests. He is the first to point out that Gutenberg may indeed have invented the type mould. Something the scholars of the period were unable to fathom. His writings were important and influential. Updike followed in his footsteps. He was a revivalist \\*before\" Morris. We probably wouldn't be discussing anything type related here and now had this dude not lived.   \n   \nThis is De Vinne inspired face. I don't know the exact name of this particular typeface or the rip off foundry that produced it. And I don't care.\n\n"

But most importantly, the display DeVinne \"is credited with bringing an end to the period of overly ornate and fanciful display faces of the nineteenth century, and with restoring the dignity of plain roman types.\" !!!   \n   \nThis from McGrew's American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century.\n\n"
