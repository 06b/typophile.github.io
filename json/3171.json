  "content": "I am building a CFF/OpenType family for a client that insists that two of the weights of the multi-weight family be named Book and Regular. I have always avoided having both of these names in the same family.   \n   \nThe fonts work correctly in Illustrator CS (both Mac and PC) but in InDesign CS whenever Regular is selected it immediately changes to Book. This happens both on Mac and PC.   \n   \nAnyone else have this experience.\n\n",
