This layout appears to use some sort of automatic kerning - this spacing doesn't really reflect what I see in the actual font at all.\n\n"

      "content": "Hmm I probably spoke a bit over casually casually. Like that's never happened before. ;-) But I'll take the bait in hopes of learning more...\n\nAssuming for the sake of argument that the spacing stayed the same - already something we know it should not - I would make the Cap T more narrow. I would drop the leg on the R to let the R get closer. The N & L might be more narrow. If the s is going to be so close it should tuck under the y. The various serif like ends like on the n - I would cut them back slightly.\n\nBut obviously I say all this quite advisedly because really I haven't seen the font as intended. For one thing there is very little of the lower case to go by. Does anybody know where I can see more? I have googled it & no dice. Christian, is there a PDF we could look at?\n\nAnd what do you think?\n\n"
