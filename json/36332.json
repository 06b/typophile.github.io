      "content": "I like the second version a lot - except the “1”, which I’d prefer either not splitted at all, or only in two pieces, because cutting the stem in two seems totally causeless and disturbing.\n\nAnd no, the logo doesn’t remind me of mobile at all — not even after reading about this possible resemblance. Maybe it’s partially because I’ve never seen the Mobile logo in black-and-white.\n\n"
