      "content": "Hi there:\n\nBodoni is inherently beautiful. However if your going to choose a 'classical' Bodoni type, the Bitstream Bauer Bodoni is widely accepted one of the most elegant.\n\nFor a modern spin on Bodoni, Emigre's Filosophia is a most fabulous choice.\n\nRead this article to help you make up your mind: [http://www.fonthaus.com/xheight/bodoni.cfm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020165626/http:/www.fonthaus.com/xheight/bodoni.cfm \"http://www.fonthaus.com/xheight/bodoni.cfm\")\n\nThose are my pix. Hope I have helped you.\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"

The ITC is very beautiful too but it looks more delicate and that's not what I am looking for this project.\n\nAbout the Andrade Pro, it is also very beautiful but I don't like the capital G.\n\nThanks guys, I think I will continue with Bauer Bodoni, but at least now I know why.\n\nStill if anyone has other suggestions I think its always fun to take a look at it!\n\n:)\n\n"
