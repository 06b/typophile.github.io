  "content": "OK here is again the same question you have seen here innumerable times…\n\nDo you have any suggestions for body type?\n\nMagazine is going to be a casual magazine for PC-oriented twenty-something game players with some technology and lifestyle articles thrown in. Not too hippy, thick or glamorous. Coated stock, 48 pages, published fortnightly.\n\nThere is high probability it is going to be a sans serif face.\n\nMost sans serifs have though problems with legibility when used in long articles. They are too geometric: eye does not have enough “grabbing points”. Also they are usually too thin, the color of text is too light.\n\nI have used Formata a lot. It is very readable. I rather used something else in this project. Formata is… homely. Almost ugly. But it works well in small sizes.\n\nI like Meta a lot, but it feels too artful for this.\n\nThings to consider are also width of the font, font should be economical, fit a lot of text in small space.  \nBasically there is no need for other styles than regular (or book or medium, depending), italic, bold and bold italic. It would be nice if font’s family system would not mess up InDesign’s ability to keep italics and bolds in styles (as happens both Formata and Meta).\n\nOther fonts will be selected to fit body font… but at the moment I have Helvetica Compressed in mind for headlines… it may well change.\n\n",

Don’t know if the price is ‘economical,’ but I think the value on this family is extremely high —- and worth checking out!
