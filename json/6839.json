Possibly [Classical Garamond Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20050819034800/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/classical-garamond/) from Bitstream... very artificially condensed/squooshed... with a thermometer instead of an apostrophe?   \n   \nthen � FINE MEN�S CLOTHING�... for which I can�t find a suitable match. Although tempted to guess �extra bold version of Times�, the �S� serifs and the serif at right end of the �L�s� horizontal stroke don�t match... and I can�t locate a version that is simply bold enough.   \n   \nI tried... but no cigar   \n   \ncheers,   \nDana\n\n"
