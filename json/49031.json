It's photographers book with a run of about 100-250 books and is more image based. Attention to detail would be pretty important.\n\nthanks a lot in advance if you have any info!\n\n",

[http://www.meridianprinting.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720142418/http:/www.meridianprinting.com/ \"http://www.meridianprinting.com/\")  \nMy wife also suggests that you simply make \"portfolio\" editions by printing the text conventionally; make 100 to 200 photographic prints of the images; and then hand-affix the images onto the book pages. Something like the old method of spot-gluing plates in letterpress days.  \nThe resulting albums could be very valuable.\n\n"

      "content": "When you say \"short-run,\" are you thinking about offset or digital printing?\n\nIf you are printing only 250 books, an offset shop such as Meridian is going to be very spendy. But charles\\_e is right: they are very good.\n\nSince you are not getting any responses about short-run printers in NYC, check out BookMobile.  \n [http://www.bookmobile.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720142418/http:/www.bookmobile.com/ \"http://www.bookmobile.com/\")  \nMostly they do paperback books on uncoated stock. But they also do very good photo work on coated stock, and they can bind your book in boards. Their high-end color & b/w work is getting very close to \"offset-quality\" when they are given good files to work with.\n\n& they will send you a set of proofs before they run the whole edition.\n\npowers\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Will,\n\nNot to disagree terribly, but \"approaching offset\" is a loaded term. I've seen some pretty poor offset printing (including images).\n\nThe only way to get it right, regardless of the paper, is to prepare a profile for a printer -- taking into account the \\*characteristics\\* of both the paper used & the press (includes ink). Then ignore all that dribble the printer sends out about chopping off the last 10 percent of the black & white. The profile handles dot gain; done right, you only loose about 1/2 of one percent with the black. White loss depends on the boundary colors (tones) of the image & whether or not you want to allow them to fade into the paper.\n\nI suppose I'm biased, but it became apparent to me long ago that the old dicta \"price, quality, speed -- pick two\" is wrong. It is really \"pick one.\"\n\n"

It is up to Otto to work out all these things with the printer he chooses. That's one reason I noted that BookMobile provides proofs. Often enough, short-run printers say \"give us the files; we'll send you your done job.\" Not good enough.\n\nOtto: wherever you print this, keep in mind Charles's points.\n\npowers\n\n"
