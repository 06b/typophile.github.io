Years ago an art director commissioned me to do a book cover that looked like the neon lights on the strip in Las Vegas. The following image was part of the result.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117015427im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bulb-sml_4188.jpg)\n\nThis is simply Photoshop technique that can be applied to the vector information in any font. I think you can find tutorials about how to do this online. It helps if you're starting with a font that's in keeping with the style, which is why that link to House Industries above that Lari posted is useful, but there's no one font (to my knowledge) that conveys the glow of neon lighting.\n\n"

I have had enough already from everyone so just don't do it okay?  \nIn regards to 'What's Up'? Well, nothing is up. Everyone is just making a big deal about me not spelling right and not good enough grammer. I have agreed to make more of an effort but what really upsets me is that if people give me respect, i give respect back. That is what is up. If people treat me and my threads with respect, then I shall give back more if I can and if I have the knowledge to do so. Everyone on here thinks it's ok to mess around on my threads and treat me like nothing. Atleast I don't do that on someone elses thread, do i? I have done nothing to upset no one (apart from spellings and grammer and i didn't know it would affect so many people) but I have accepted that now. I am trying my best. What else does everyone want from me on here? Please don't turn this thread into a World War 3 thread. The world doesn't need it. The case rests here and NOW!  \nPS Bieler, what is so 'inane' about this question? What have i done now eh?\n\n"

It will catch eg. that 'grammer' should be 'grammar'. The green grammar squiggle also helps catch typos.\n\n"
