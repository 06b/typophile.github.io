I did manage to get him over to the [Design Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804173631/http:/www.museum-gestaltung.ch/), which was cool and does have at least [one typographic exhibition](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804173631/http:/www.museum-gestaltung.ch/en/exhibitions/annual-program-2014/weingart-typography/) coming up.\n\n"
