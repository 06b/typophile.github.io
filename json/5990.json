      "content": "Back in school, I saw Tufte speak (on the school's dime), and admission included his 3 books. For those who haven't seen or read him, it's quite fun and informative. He essentially walks through his books, which is good or bad depending on your expectations. I think he's a necessary component of any info designer's education. However, like any source of wisdom,\\* I found it was best to read it, revel in it, then rebel against it. Tufte-esque infographics became the new Swiss modernism for some people: \"this work is good because it looks like X.\"   \n   \nEveryone who reads that should read Nigel Holmes' [Designer's Guide to Creating Charts and Diagrams](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224624/http:/search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=AQv1v3Mqi6&isbn=0823013383&itm=5). He helped define _Time_'s info-graphic style for a period, and Tufte can't stand him. I mostly can't stand him either, but he occasionally alights on some great ideas. At the very least it's good for a contrasting perspective. He represents, in many ways, the info-graphics philosophy that Tufte called for a break from: the idea that info-graphics are inherently boring and need to be spiced up and dressed up as illustrations.   \n   \n   \n\\*up for debate\n\n"
