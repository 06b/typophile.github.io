About this saga:   \n   \nThe first is very teoretical, but doesen't work well, looks very big compared to \"a\".   \nThe second is something close to the natural way of writing the character by hand, not so high as \"o\", and not so low as \"a\".   \nThe third is the other extreme, you should try to see how it looks hext to \"o\", \"b\", \"s\", \"e\"... see Neuropol made by Ray Larabie [http://larabiefonts.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017042654/http:/larabiefonts.com/)   \n   \nIf you decide to go with the last \"m\", balance the position of the middle stem.   \n   \nGorjan\n\n"

It is a flipped **d** (right?), which makes it work better with the rest of the lowercase (except, as Gorjan points out, with **a**... have you tried any single-story variations of **a**?   \n   \nAs for the alternate **m** , I'm not sure it would work next to all of the lowercase characters, only a few of them. Place an **o** or a **u** right after it and you'll see what I mean.   \n   \nKeep it up!\n\n"

I hope you realease this one!   \n   \nNow my crit!   \n   \nI like the top b best - what if the m was rounded like an arch with a support collumn? Maybe the feet could curl in a tiny bit like the bottom of the 'e'. What about pulling the bottom right leg of the k further to the right & giving it more kerned space? I think the 'i' & 'l' need a little more space too.   \n   \nLooking at the original PDF I wonder about swithching the M & m shapes. The cap uses the form I just imagined. The 4 seeps too wide. The cap Y could use some extra width - it looks cramped.\n\n"
