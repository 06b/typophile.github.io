  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to determine the font used for the subtitles in the film \"Inglourious Basterds \"\n\nThe auto font detect feature on a website says it is \"St Transmission-600 Semi Bold font\" but I disagree the lower case i is different. I've also heard it may be Ariel but I don't know, if anyone does please help.\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-07-07 at 8.36.19 AM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150108184015/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-07-07%20at%208.36.19%20AM.png) | 23.85 KB |\n\n",
