In the beginning I had an \"e\" and \"a\" that were falling backward, I replaced them while working… but yeah... ill replace the \"n\", too in my face now... but \"s\" im not certain about, really hate working on that character, i avoid that latter….  \ndid a pretty good job too, that character must be taken out from the alphabet… I don’t need it…\n\n"
