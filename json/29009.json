      "content": "The only problem with the “same designer” logic is that it’s only a starting point. When you actually compare Whitney and Kievit, you see that Whitney is much coarser, with Grotesque features that aren’t nearly as sympathetic to Requiem. Depending on your usage, Kievit should pair quite well with Requiem.\n\nUse fonts by the same designer when that designer tends to make a lot of type that’s similar (Zapf, Unger, Gill); but with eclectic designers like Hoefler, Schwartz and Carter, it’s not as safe a policy.\n\n"
