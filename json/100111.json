If you are going to also be doing Greek and Cyrillic, I would think you would \\*at least\\* do Adobe Latin 3 (includes Windows Eastern European, Baltic and Turkish codepages). But you can go even further if you like.\n\nA couple of references:  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/08/defining\\_an\\_ext.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723103234/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/08/defining_an_ext.html \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/08/defining\\_an\\_ext.html\")  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended\\_latin.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723103234/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended\\_latin.html\")\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

This is a pretty simple font (all caps) that I am extending (from my own design) as a first step in learning about Cyrillic and Greek alphabets.\n\nI feel right now that what I want to do is set encoding to ISO 8859-1 Latin1 + ISO 8859-5 Cyrillic. I know that doesn't work. But is there a default unicode encoding I can set the font to that will let me support the multiple character sets?\n\nMy goal is a font that will work in Illustrator/InDesign.\n\n"

      "content": "You don't need to do anything but assigning the correct Unicode values to your characters.\n\nInDesign, Illustrator, and all other type related software worth its salt are oblivious of any of the encodings you mention. The reason is that these \"encodings\" are meant as a Unicode-to-8 bit table translation. What will happen when you select one of them, is that FontLab will re-order your _Unicode_ characters into the encoding specified, delete the rest (?) and export only the characters in that specific encoding.\n\nIs it required to select an encoding in FontLab? If so, choose something sounding like \"Unicode (BMP)\".\n\n"

Never had the problem before of characters getting cut off when I imported a font file, but I've been playing around with encodings (just to see what characters were included) and seem to have stuck my font inside one... I think it is sorted out now. At least, the Cyrillic is showing up again.\n\nThanks for all the help here.\n\n"
