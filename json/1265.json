Not in the legal sense, not in the United States.   \n   \nIf that were the case, Hrant would have a trademark on Helvomita.   \n   \nA work is \"copyrighted\" when it's published\\* or seen by a third party.   \nBut a trademark is different.   \n   \nIn a TM dispute, simply USING a mark first isn't enough.   \nFIRST to FILE is also important if you want to use your   \nmark outside of a limited geographic area.   \n   \nI agree that TMs typically destract...   \n   \n\\>\\>You can register it if you want to, but there isn't much point unless   \nyou're a multi-million-dollar brand name.   \n   \nPartially disagree. If Scott wants to ensure that nobody gets the name,   \nnow or in the future, not only does he need to be First to Use   \nbut First to File.   \n   \nIf someone independently comes up with Creative Squeeze and   \nfiles a federal trademark (and it goes through the process,   \nincluding being Published for Opposition)   \nthen it will impede Scott from getting \"national\" with his mark.   \nHe will have to stay regional and may   \nget a Cease and Desist from the other Creative Squeeze that'll   \ncost a lot more than $335 to handle.   \n   \nIn my opinion.   \n   \nHrant, you can file all kinds of city, county and state stuff but   \n [www.uspto.gov](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225139/http:/www.uspto.gov/) is the place to go to file a national trademark.   \n   \nIf your trade channels don't extend beyond your state, then   \nit probably isn't necessary.   \n   \nThese are opinions, btw, based on my own dealing with this   \nstuff. However, I'd check with a competent attorney.   \n   \nbj\n\n"
