  "content": "Hi, I’m working on a project for a class attempting to recreate a magazine cover. I’ve got everything figured out except for the typeface used on the cover in the magazine topics: “Fall Comfort!” “Steak Chili...” etc. (shown in attachment).\n\nI used What the Font and the closest I could come up with is one of the fonts within FF Transit, although there are differences:\n\n-the letter “k” looks different on the magazine cover, the diagonal strokes meet in a “t”  \n-the weight is heavier and letters more condensed than what I’m seeing in Transit  \n-the ends of the C are angled on the cover\n\nI may be wrong on the typeface. What do you guys think? Is it an altered version of Transit? Hopefully I am wrong and it’s a typeface within my library because I’m not paying for Transit! :)\n\nI’ve also included a screenshot of FF Transit Print Normal from Fontshop.com\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cuisinecover.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090924021359/http:/typophile.com/files/cuisinecover.jpg) | 539.87 KB |\n| [Picture 17.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090924021359/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2017_9.png) | 10.85 KB |\n\n",
