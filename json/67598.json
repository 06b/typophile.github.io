It is used for my company name and can be seen at [www.national-electrical.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20121030010427/http:/www.national-electrical.com/ \"www.national-electrical.com\")\n\nNo one in the sign business can find it, nor the web. If anyone knows anything about it or a different name used for it please let me know.  \nThank you very much...  \nPaul\n\n",
