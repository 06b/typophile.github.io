Whenever I think about how I kept putting it off before they switched it to invite I get nauseous and feel like my life is incomplete.\n\nDoes anyone either have an account or know someone who can invite me? I can trade something! Plush toys, web design, Nestle candy, sewing, design magazines, books.\n\nThank you!\n\n",
