Twombly briefly worked for Bigelow as well. Her typeface [Mirarae](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030173507/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=BT.6414.0.0) won the Morisawa type design competition, and was produced by Bitstream. She worked for [Adobe Systems](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030173507/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adobe%20Systems) from 1988-99, producing many well-known typefaces, including [Lithos](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030173507/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.398.0.0), [Trajan](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030173507/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.108134.0.0), and [Adobe Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030173507/http:/store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_180.html). She retired from type design and left Adobe in 1999 to do other crafts, such as textile-based design and jewellery.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Carol Twombly Adobe Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030173507/http:/typophile.com/node/519)  \n [Carol Twombly Typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030173507/http:/typophile.com/node/31669)  \n [  \n](http://web.archive.org/) [Carol Twombly..
