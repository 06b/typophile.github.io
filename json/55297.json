      "content": "It is _probably_ okay, but not officially recommended. I'm not aware of any situation in which it would break, but that doesn't mean that there isn't some piece of software out there with an in-built assumption that all font names contain only A-Z and a-z.\n\nWe took the risk many years ago, including numerals in a font name (Garamond 1530) and didn't run into any problems, but I noticed that even fairly recently when Adobe were experimenting with naming optical masters by explicit size they spelled out the numbers, e.g. 'ten' instead of '10'.\n\nOnce, when mastering a large set of fonts for a client, I came across # in a font name, and my recommendation to the client was that we should get rid of this. One simply doesn't know what problems a character like # or & might cause.\n\nSo I'm not necessarily saying that you should play it safe, but if you wanted to play it safe, you would avoid &.\n\n"

      "content": "It's a bad idea. In Windows, application menu captions are written in a way that ampersands precedes the letter that gets the menu keyboard shortcut assigned. So if the source code of the application says \"&Open\" and \"S&ave as...\", the menu will have \"O\" in _O_pen and \"a\" in \"S_a_ve as\" underlined, and those letters will work as keyboard shortcuts.\n\nDepending on how cleanly a programmer has written the code, it may happen that the same is applied to font names displayed in the menu. So if you name your font \"Black&White\", the user may actually see \"Black_W_hite\" with \"W\" underlined, which will obviously be nonsense.\n\n"

The sorts of reserved uses that Adam described for Windows menus can also apply to other areas of programming. Operating systems might handle them, but I’ve run into software that was not coded to anticipate filenames with special characters or spaces and starts misbehaving. It gets especially bad once the files end up on a CD/DVD, where the mastering software may not be capable of dealing with nonstandard filenames but will burn something to disc anyway, without ever raising an error.\n\n"

Such special characters in Linux often make life more difficult on the command line. The ampersand, for instance, stops the command at that character, and puts whatever was called into the background. One can always remedy this by writing \\& for &, but it always is frustrating to have to go through long internet addresses and pick out the special characters, for example.  \nAlso, in Xe(La)TeX one has to declare the font in the document using the full name installed on the machine. An ampersand here would be seen as a misplaced alignment character, and I would just have to hope that \\& would remedy it.\n\n"
