By 1897 the imitations with minor variations by otherfoundries was a source of strong comment in the Inland Printer. I suspect that \"Germania\" et. al was a production of BB&S, but will have to check. The original is available in digital form in Ralph Unger's Bradley [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/bradley/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822104424/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/bradley/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/bradley/\")  \nDon  \nNote: corrected post.\n\n"

      "content": "Many thanks Mike! A veritable flood of copycats with minor variations. I wonder how many he missed? Do you have any information on the intrepid researcher Bernhard Schnelle?  \nThe \"Germania\" variation is in Dan X. Solo's catalog at page 109.  \nI don't know if \"Germania\" dates from circa 1900 -- nothing on this variation in Petzendorfer's big Schriften Atlas of 1898 or Phillips Old Fashioned Type Book of 1945 -- or whether it was another kick at the can from a lettering artist in the photo-type era. Many but not all of the fonts in the big Solo Catalog were metal. This variation never made it into the Letraset catalog. Out of curiosity I will flip though the big Photo Lettering catalog when I next visit my local university library.  \nIf all else fails I can have a drink of Ketel One vodka\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822104424im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KetelOneSM_5389.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"

      "content": "I standardized the the scale of Jim Fordyce's Deutsch Gothic of 1994 and Dieter Steffmann's Germania and compared several glyphs. I found that the outlines of the Germania glyphs are point for point identical with those of Deutsch Gothic. I conclude that Germania is a clone of Deutsch Gothic, but note that some glyphs have been added to supplement the basic alphabet. I have not seen Dabblet, but given the stated date, I suspect that it is an original digitization. I suspect that with the exception of Deutsch Gothic and/or Dabblet, all of the others on the well researched list provided by Fivos, are clones.  \nDon\n\n"

I hope he is alive and in good health. Google Jim Fordyce font maker and all that pops up are links to his fonts.  \nDon\n\n"
