Watch for more news in this space as we consider our alternatives.   \n   \nIn order to try and keep our host happy we've had to **temporarily** delete any messages older than 720 days in hopes of lightening server load. We'll do everything in our power to ensure this type of outage doesn't happen again.   \n   \nThe floor is yours!
