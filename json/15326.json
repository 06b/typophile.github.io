Obviously the use of colored inks in printing pre-date the use of movable type, and lettering in manuscripts were also in various color inks or tempera.\n\nWas the term “color” actually derived from another word, language or term much in the same way as “font”? I am actually interested in knowing since many students don’t seem too satisfied with the conventional answer of “color” means grayness.\n\nDoes anyone know of an historic reference and not just a speculative answer?\n\n [‹ Beauchamp: Pronounced “Rip-off”](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042402/http:/typophile.com/node/15455 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Sam Welo and Fred Drake ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042402/http:/typophile.com/node/15437 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The essence of typesetting is regulating the size of those spaces to control the balance and rhythm between black and white. This is the key to a graphically harmonious page—one with good \\*type color\\*—as well as to text that is pleasing and easy to read.”\n\nIt is an even texture, not a uniform grey that is aimed at in the idea of “even color”.\n\nI am not saying that “color” is all that satisfactory term. As Norbert points out in the beginning of this thread, it is not very descriptive or clear. But if you are saying that “even color” doesn’t refer to something real and important in type, I think you are very off base. Typographers have known what it refers to—an important quality in type and page design and composition—even though they haven’t perhaps ever explained it well.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with modernism. I’m pretty sure the phrase ’evenness of color’ predates 20th century modernism.\n\nThe people who have been working daily to produce evenly colored pages know what they are referring to.

I said the term ’color’ is not very descriptive, but that it refers to something real, and the challenge is to explain it.\n\nLetter forms are diverse, and obviously deliberately, so that one letter is distinguishable from others. The H and the O don’t look alike. But when you space a string of Hs and Os for a typeface, you aim at a quality that typographers and type designers have sometimes called ’even color’. In ’Letters of Credit’ Walter Tracy uses the words ’harmony’ and ’balance’ to refer to this, rather than ’even color’. Others speak of the volume of space between the letters being uniform—though what that volume is is somewhat hard to define (how far does the volume extend into the ’c’?). What is aimed at is a visual quality that practiced typographers will have a large degree of agreement on—such on what constitutes ’good’ kerning—what, yes achieves ’even color’.\n\n’Evenness of color’ is not a phrase that denies diversity, but rather tries to express in a not very clear phrase a visual harmony and balance in a diverse group of symbols on a page.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBy the way, your view that the Enlightenment was opposed to diversity is balderdash.

The grey-value is constituted by the play of black and white within the text block. ’Even’ is an emergant quality. ’Even’ at the text-block level does not mean undifferentiated at the letterform construction or stroke contrast level. If it is ’even’ the setting is not disturbed by rivers, clogged with areas of greater density of black, such as might be caused by pockets of too boldly rendered double two-story g’s. Consistency of grey-value is not in competition with the need for stems bowls and counters to have proper salience and independant cue-value at the microscale of wordform resolution. Professionally-set well-printed pages set in Smeijer’s Quadraat, a moderately lively typeface, can have a wonderfully assertive but still consistent grey value top to bottom, front to back over many pages in its running text areas. A ragged right setting, dynamic positioning of the text-block on the page, subheadings or section marks in a contrasting weight, strategically placed running heads and folios, can give pages with a consistent grey value in their running text vitality, articulation and navigability.\n\n’Eveness’ or consistency of grey-value at the macro-scale of the text-block is not a power grab of the complacent. And it isn’t the only requirement. It has a place within a heirarchy of typographic values. ’Eveness’ and consistency of grey-value at the macro-scale of the paragraph or text-block are perceptual processing requirements for a smooth reading experience, an experience not distracted by the subliminally signaling force of non-essential variation in colour or rhythm.\n\n"

Clarity and simplicity of meaning will do a lot in understanding the essential aspect of the term _color_.\n\nFIRST: Strip away “typeface” from the definition. Since a block of copy can contain several weights (book, medium, bold), styles (roman, italic, condensed) and even kinds (serif, sans serif, script) of typefaces it is only the DENSITY of glyphs that matter.\n\nSECOND: “Paragraph” confuses the definition. It is a block or deliniated area of glyphs we are attempting to describe.  \nA single page can contain several blocks or areas of text which are differentiated by _color_ (captions, sidebars, extended quotations). If our refined definition of _typographic color_ holds true, then even changing the line measure (indenting) or justification (centering) affects the overall color.\n\nTHIRD: Remove any references to “readability” from the definition. The typographer must look at readability as a separate issue from _color_. You can make one or two minor adjustments (leading, letterspacing) that would affect _color_ while the readability of the text remains virtually the same.\n\nFORTH: For clarity, replace _gray_ with _tonal value_. The terms “tone” and “value” individually have multiple meanings, but together speak specifically to the range of light to dark. Copy blocks set in or reversed out of actual ink colors (red, blue, etc.) can vary in tonal value so why confuse it with “gray.” Also, different ink colors can have the same tonal value, so in that instance it is HUE that differentiates blocks of copy.\n\nFIFTH: Keep texture as separate from typographic color. Though both are integral, one modulates the other much in the same way melody and cadence do in music.\n\nBy focusing on one perceivable attribute I believe we can arrive at clearer definition of the typographic term _color_ (though I personally would replace it with _tonal density_). But before we attempt it, I feel we to exercise our eyes with a few examples. Remember the expression, “You can’t see the forest through the trees”? You can’t see _color_ when you are too close to the type.\n\nEXAMPLES OF TYPOGRAPHIC “COLOR”\n\nGuilelmus Parisiensis.  \n [_Postilla super epistolas et euangelia_](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042402/http:/www.loc.gov/exhibits/heavenlycraft/images/rw750s.jpg).  \nVenetian Woodcut: Jacobus Pentius de Leuco, 1505.\n\nVirgil.  \n [_Bucolica, Georgica et Aeneis_](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042402/http:/www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/rarebook/art3283c/1757.htm).  \nBirminghamiae, typis Johannis Baskerville, 1757.  \n_Comentary_: “Baskerville’s first book was a revolution that influenced printing on the Continent as well as Great Britain.

I think there is good evidence that were acutely aware of this, and very deliberately introduced such variations in a way that both created lively, readable texture, and still gave even color. I am not sure about how even Civilite is, but in other faces Granjon was, and for sure Caslon was aiming at this, as well as a varied texture.\n\nNone of those quoted here claim that evenness of color means turning everything to grey. The alway discuss how to balance and harmonize diverse elements.\n\nIt is only Hrant who has created the straw-man fantasy of “the even color boys” who are supposedly on some whacky crusade to turn the world grey to satisfy their lust for control because of their admiration of monotheism, Rome, the enlightenment, the twentieth century and whatever else Hrant hates.\n\nIn reality, these old folks were not just aware, but devoted to making typography that achieves balance and harmony with diverse elements. For traditional printers, the typeface with its diversity of forms was already a given, set in metal, and the issue was to mass them in way that is lively but retains ’even color’.\n\nFor the type designer the goal has been to strike a balance so the diverse forms of the letters knit into an even texture while preserving and emphasizing “stems bowls and counters ...[that] have proper salience and independant cue-value at the microscale.”\n\nI like Norbert’s suggestion to keep even tone and texture as two different variables, which helps clarity. However, I have to disagree that color has nothing to do with readability. As Peter has noted, evenness of the resulting set type aids readability. The point is that you have a predictable, even background, against which the diverse elements in the letters that are key for recognition stand out. If you have variation in non-informational characteristics this becomes ’noise’ that interferes with the readability of the text. (My translation of the Ennesonese.)\n\nSo yes, Hrant, you can have too much uniformity and that hurts readibility. But you can also have too little and that hurts readibility also. It is the balance that is the key, and your crusade against gray is unbalanced.\n\nYou can have different sizes of type with different ’color’ as in Norbert’s first example. But if you mixed different sizes or colors in the same line it would definitely slow down the reader. (Of course, sometimes you want the reader to slow down, and use italics or caps, but that is another matter.)\n\n"

Who exactly is in this crowd? Bringhurst and Felici, who brought on your attack, explicitly talk about harmony and balance of diverse element. Someone else?\n\nYes, deliberate variation is important to texture, and I do think Peter is right that the variation in stress in, for example Caslon, is an example. I think to call it discordance is going too far, though. Such variation must be brought into harmony so that, yes, an even color is achieved or else the variation will distract and make the text less readable.\n\nI believe the reason that variation is not so much talked about as even color is that variation in form is a given, and even color is usually the difficult challenge to achieve, whether in type design or page design. You are dealing in design of the roman with two different alphabets—caps and lower case—and each letter with a different shape and different differentiating features. To keep these differentiating features noticeable in the blink of an eye, yet with the evenness to guide and not slow down the reader is a major challenge.\n\nIn the early days of printing even color was also mechanically also quite a challenge to achieve, which is another reason it was talked about.\n\nNow it is true that you can achieve even color with dullness in page design, or type, so the challenge is much more than even color. But even color is such a huge part of the challenge, and that is why it is talked about. But Tracy, for example, talks about the dangers of dullness as well as the need for harmony and balance.\n\nNow as to being discordant to the point of being ugly or awkward, I think it is demonstrably wrong that this is necessary. Baskerville is a refutation. It is an admirably readable text type, and each letter has a neoclassical balance and beauty,\n\nI don’t deny that you can have effective text types where individual shapes of letters look awkward on their own, but the letters in question must look harmonious in combination with other letters. If a letter looks awkward or discordant in combination—it fails to harmonize—then I think the typeface is hurt as a text face by that letter. This applies most strictly to the lower case. With upper case letters, which mark the beginning of sentences, it is possible to over weight them, violating even color, and for this to be functional.\n\nThe balance of diversity and evenness is a fascinating business, at the heart of good type and page design.\n\n"

Making them different, but intelligently so is what’s beyond the abilities -but also desire- of so many.”\n\nMaking glyphs—or place-holders in a glyph set—different enough so that role architectural particulars and evoked form have proper salience and independant cue value, but the same enough so that they conjoin constructively on a visual wordform level, and so that the response bias to visual whole-word-form resolution is not compromised, and so that the gestalt impression of the block of text is not problematic, but smooth in tone, vibrant in texture and consistent in its attributes across diverse blocks of text and within itself, is the mark of a professional—desired by all who know their craft, exacting at both ends, and acheived by a goodly number.\n\nYou want to push the ’different’ envelope and that is respectable. Others don’t, and you are frustrated that they don’t or that they don’t want to push it us far as you do. You think intelligent difference is a functional benefit. And you are right. But so is formal familiality. They are both important at the subterranean level of processing within the visual cortex, or so I believe. And there is no error in being mindful of the one (sameness / familiality / conjunctivity) if it is not at the expense of the other (difference / divergence / perceptual distance). It is just that your sense of where the inflection points (a term I picke up from Kevin) between the pressures lies is different from others.\n\n"

But It just occured to me that sometimes I have have read the term color in the context of type to mean just this idea ’pushing’. I am a little sick at the moment & don’t quite trust my thought process... As in ’this face has color’ - as opposed to being bland. Of course this is also a somewhat couter intuitive use of the term at first too. But when you see a beatiful and not dull page it makes some sense I think. Color in this sense might be related to saying that the text is lively or sparkles. Maybe therfe is a continum\n\ngrey\\> dull\\> plain\\> color\\> lively\\> sparkles\\> hurts my eyes?\n\n’Color’ being the place you would probably want the text to be if it was a text face. ’Sparkles’ might be okay in a display face.\n\n"

This would be in contrast to having dull looking skin for instance which would be associated with being un-well or spending excessive time in the dark... When I think of type ’having color’ this is the color I think of.\n\nThinking about type as being darker in the same phrase seems odd & simple to me... It seems would be easier & more descriptive to just say it is darker.\n\nBut this brings us back to the statement already made that the term ’color’ does take on meaning over time & that what is meant by it isn’t always all that clear.\n\nThis ambiguity seems inevitable to me.\n\n"

Selection of typeface and fine tuning textsetting are the only means of solution.\n\n**Type Design & “Punchcutter” Viewpoint**  \nIn regards to developing text faces, design decisions are made based on how they resolve at the macro level, with adjustments and fine tuning made at the micro level. Once a typeface is released, there are no adjustments to be made by the type designer.\n\n**Issues to consider**  \nFor the benefit of Forum members and readers who may know certain details about type design prior to phototypesetting, _color_ was often adjusted by the type designer (and punchcutter) for EACH text point size font that was released. If one were to closely examine clean specimen sheets of block settings at 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14 pt. text, the subtle adjustments to design and widths are quite evident. Also, designers of hot metal typefaces were concerned not only with scaling adjustments but also account for printing methods where ink had tendencies to “well up” and “plug counters.”\n\nScaling of digital fonts from text to display settings is of major concern to type designers today, though not always apparent to your average graphic designer. Training the eye to “see” type color is the only way to understand what adjustments can be made.\n\n[**These illustrations**](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042402/http:/www.acmedigital.net/JianSabu/multi-master.htm) from Adobe’s guide to creating multiple masters might give the novice an idea of some factors involved.\n\nAlso, the viewer must take into consideration that _typeface color_ can only be examined based on final output or near final resolution since the subtle details are lost on screen.\n\n"
