[Eidetic Neo](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804183130/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneo.html), in itself a beautiful and very forward-   \nthinking serif face, has a great unicase weight [Omni](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804183130/http:/www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PEidOm.html).   \n   \nAlso, both Emigre's [Platelet](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804183130/http:/www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PPlaR.html) and [Democratica](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804183130/http:/www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PDemR.html) have capitals   \nthat are x-height sized, so they lend themselves perfectly to   \nunicase setting.   \n   \nAnd I know this is probably stretching it a bit thin, but   \ncombining [Mrs. Eaves](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804183130/http:/www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMrsR.html) lowercase with the [Petite Capitals](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804183130/http:/www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMrsP.html)   \n- smaller than the Small Caps and also x-height sized -   \nallows one to set unicase as well.\n\n",
