  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m just about to start the design of a book about Atlantis (the lost city with advanced technology and culture of the greek mythology). It’s not an absolute scientific stlye, more like a travelogue. It has a LOT of pictures, so there isn’t any too long textblocks. The author takes it a bit more serious than it actually is (he isn’t an archeologist, or anything similar to that), however it do seem to be exciting and he refers to a lot of fact..\n\nSo my problem is about choosing the right shape of his voice. I’ve been looking for the right typeface for some days now, altough i wouldn’t mention any of them, because i’m more interested in what others would think of. I don’t really have a lot of time for the full design so that’s why I ask for your suggestions.\n\nPlease share your toughts.\n\nThanks,  \nIstván\n\n",
