  "content": "Hello Typophile,\n\nI have a few announcements to make...\n\nI have decided to open source a bunch of code that I have written for various type development tools. You can learn more at [code.typesupply.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225006/http:/code.typesupply.com/) You might find the [FontLab Scripts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225006/http:/code.typesupply.com/wiki/FontLabScripts) and the [FeatureProof application](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225006/http:/code.typesupply.com/wiki/FeatureProof) to be particularly useful.\n\nIn other news, I launched a new Type Supply website at [typesupply.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225006/http:/typesupply.com/) and started a blog at [talleming.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225006/http:/talleming.com/).\n\nThat's all for now. Have fun!\n\n",

NO WARRANTEES. NO GUARANTEES. NO QUESTIONS.\" has a certain sense of humour to it, it is non-free :-)\n\nI hope you can spare a couple of minutes to update the license of the code in these directories :-)\n\nThanks again,\n\n--  \nRegards,  \nDave\n\n"
