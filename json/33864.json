      "content": "This is not really a \"font\" per se. There are machines for engraving letters in metal using a cutting tool. This looks typical of that method. They don't use \"fonts\" in the normal sense, instead tracing paths in the shape of letters. [Here is an example of what I mean.](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307124417/http:/www.suregrave.com/wizzard-st.html) Originally, before they worked with computers, you would actually trace a sort of template with letters cut into it with a sort of pantographic mechanism. I remember seeing one of these when I was a kid. I believe the letter shapes go back to those older machines.\n\n"

The [Leroy Lettering Guides](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307124417/http:/www.tpub.com/engbas/3-35.htm) worked on a similar principle -- you trace the letter shapes that are engraved into a template and the pen (or engraving tool) at the end of the pantographic device reproduces the letter shape.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
