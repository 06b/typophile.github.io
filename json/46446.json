  "content": "Hello, I have recently been reworking Kabel.\n\nThe reason for this is that I never liked the cuts in the terminals, which put me off using it quite alot. Which is a shame as it's such a nice font.  \nOnce I had leveled out all the angled terminals I began to see other things that I wanted to change aswell.\n\nAnyway, I have included my work to date so please give me some critique on it!\n\nHenry.\n\n[http://img169.imageshack.us/img169/6259/cribsheeted6.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819220032/http:/img169.imageshack.us/img169/6259/cribsheeted6.jpg \"http://img169.imageshack.us/img169/6259/cribsheeted6.jpg\")\n\n",

      "content": "I love Kabel, and would agree that a reworking with some of the more quaint or mannered idosyncracies would benefit.\n\nWhild I love the W, i dont like the low cross bars on the E F H, and the short terminla on the j, the unusual g, and thet tall ascender of the t.\n\nThe slanted bar on the e is important, but i wonder if the angle could be reduced and the balance of the letter improved greatly.\n\n"
