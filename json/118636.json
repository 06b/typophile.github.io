Glad you like it, though.\n\nWhat kind of usage? well, I think mainly for advertising, branding, packaging, stationary, titlings, covers, labels, short or medium-lenght texts. In first trials it proves to be rather handsome for reading. We’ll see.\n\nTo be entirely honest, my current whisky has been (subconciously) a key source of inspiration for the type’s flavour ;-}\n\n"

It should continue to taper downward through the curve, or, if you feel the weight in that bottom curve is necessary, taper upward.\n\n"

But the left side of the u (and the t!) have a bottom bow which usually is a place for a stress, too. A contradiction, sort of. I left it as it was because I think it works that way. I think the disturbance is minimal.\n\nSimilar with a and g. Yes they are slightly overdone, a calculated twist within the framework of the whole set. Also the z is a bit overdone … I like it and, again, in testing with text those details did not seem to disturb readability.  \nSorry to say that, but for now it’s too late for more changes.

You know that I’m really open for improvement suggestions. But I came in this case, apparently, to different conclusions regarding the details.\n\nWhich spacing is not satisfactory?\n\nI am (and was before) fully aware of that such a quick release would cause critique as well. I’m sorry if you are disappointed about that. This was not my intention. I would not have released it if I were not convinced that the font is mature for use.  \nHope you are not too angry about me.\n\n"

And maybe the arches are a little loose? On MyFonts, it looks better, but even a “nnnnonnnn” or “nnninnnonnn” string looks still not entirely evenly spaced to me... And in the specimen images, the smaller text (in the address of the solicitors) has a bunch of really strange pairs (“ng” loose, “il” tight…) Words like “Building” do not look great to me in the preview, either. I’m not sure if that can be the rendering, or maybe I’m misunderstanding something.\n\n"

But it has one shortcoming: in small sizes it does not always reproduce the spacing very good. Maybe I neglected this a bit … therefore some parts in the smaller lines appear to be a little odd. However, I would not say that there are really severe faults here, I would have seen them.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Lindau_nom1_4357.png)\n\nThis shows TextEdit (top) and Firefox (bottom). When viewed at such a size, I’d say this is OK. Nevertheless, at a closer look there is some unevenness in the spacing, but for some good reason:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Lindau_nom2_4614.png)\n\nBecause of the more narrow area at top right (of the o, red) there is a matching slight constriction on the left side. This should balance the wider parts around the o, which are distributet reversely.\n\n"
