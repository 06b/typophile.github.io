The typeface family was expanded and changed over the decades by [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) and [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype).\n\nKabel is a geometric sans serif, similar to [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura), [Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Erbar), and [Nobel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Nobel). It is best characterized by its angular stroke endings, its Venetian e, and its distinctive g (similar to the lowercase g used in many Koch designs, including [Koch Antiqua](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Koch%20Antiqua) and [Wallau](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Wallau)).\n\n[Walter Tracy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Walter%20Tracy) wrote about Kabel in the Rudolf Koch chapter of his [Letters of Credit](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Letters%20of%20Credit). The Beatles used Kabel in for the film titling in their 1960s animated classic, _Yellow Submarine_.\n\n[Victor Caruso](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Victor%20Caruso) designed a version of Kabel for [ITC](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ITC) in the 1970s, named [ITC Kabel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ITC%20Kabel), which is not faithful to the original design. Similar to [ITC Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ITC%20Garamond), ITC Kabel has an excessively large x-height, created to please New York advertising tastes of the day.\n\nAn [overview of the Kabel type family](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/www.linotype.com/892/kabel-family.html) is available on the [Linotype website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015320/http:/www.linotype.com/).\n\n",
