So you have even the possibility to combine those two for a perfect harmonized look in multilingual settings.  \nAll fonts contain the full set of dotted ḃ ċ ḋ ḟ ġ ṁ ṗ ṡ ṫ in upper- and lowercase and an additional set of a dozen celtic ornaments.  \nThank you all typophiles who commented earlier upon single aspects of the design. I’m not Irish nor do I command any of the Gaelic languages, but, as a type freak, I enjoyed very much to dig into this matter. Maybe, you interested parties make something of it …\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415043740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schild_hib_4_4527.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415043740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schild_hib_5_4526.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415043740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schild_hib_7_4033.png)\n\n",

The only thing I do question is the sharp angle in the horizontal bar in /A. I might give that line a curve, but I'm not sure.\n\nBy the way, on the second line of the second picture you used the unicase /é instead of the lowercase /é in \"heireann\".\n\n"
