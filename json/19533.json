  "content": "First of all please excuse me if this is a repost of sorts, I’ve searched quite extensivley on the topic, but need some additional help...\n\nThe design studio I work for had a freelancer design some cover art. She ended up using a font found in the user library (OSX) “Goudy Old Face” an [FFIL](http://web.archive.org/web/20090516062651/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FFIL) font. When we sent the layered art to the press, they called me up and said Goudy Old Face was only a screen font, thus no good.\n\nI searched through my fonts and could not find a Goudy Old Face [LWFN](http://web.archive.org/web/20090516062651/http:/typophile.com/wiki/LWFN) version? So I ended up having to purchase the post scripts for the font and just sent those off.\n\nSo here is my question...\n\nIf I only see a FFIL suitcase listed in my “User/Library”, how do I know it has a printer (LWFN) font?\n\nThe reason I ask is, all of the FFIL fonts in my “User/Library” do not have any visible LWFNs? Which leads me to believe these FFIL files are worthless without their LWFN counterparts.\n\nI found this FFIL to DFONT converter, but I’m not sure making DFONT’s out of my FFIL’s is even going to do anything other than changing the wrapper?\n\nShould I just go into my “User/Library” and remove all of the FFIL fonts to prevent this in the future?\n\nThanks for any help!  \n- e\n\n",

If all you have is the FFIL (a.k.a. the font suitcase), and you put this into one of your Font directories, OS X will not show the font in your font menus.\n\nIt’s not likely to have a name like “Goudy Old Face”, more likely something like “GoudyOldFac”. PostScript font file names are usually shortened and must contain no spaces.\n\n"

So there’s no need to look for a PostScript version of it. Everything is in the FFIL file.  \nIf you’re happy with the design just tell them to use it. It’s an old myth that TrueType fonts are not printable. Every recent RIP or printer will have no problems using this TrueType font in a font suitcase.\n\nRalf\n\n[http://www.fonts.info](http://web.archive.org/web/20090516062651/http:/www.fonts.info/ \"http://www.fonts.info\")\n\n"

      "content": "There seems to be some confusion here. Rather than reply to any specific post, I’m going to state things as I understand them.\n\nThe FFIL file is what is traditionally know as a Mac font suitcase. In OS 9 and before it generally had a suitcase icon. In the case of a Postscript Type 1 font, there needs to be a LWFN paired with it; this is the Postscript Type 1 Outline.\n\nAnother common situation is that the font is a traditional Mac TrueType font. It has the outlines contained in the same file as the Suitcase. There is no obvious way to tell using only the Finder. It does not need to have a .dfont or .ttf extension, and does indeed store critical data in the resource fork. If you add the font to a font manager, you should be able to determine quickly that it is TT.\n\nIf a PostScript font suitcase is missing it’s outline, it may sometimes be refered to as ’bitmap only’ or an ’orphan’. In some applications, these faces may still be available, typically you will get a warning if you try to print them. This situation exists for backwards compatability with certain applications.\n\nIf you work in a prepress environment, you may occasionally come across ancient fonts intended to be bitmap only. These exotic beauties were either intended for screen-only use or for dot matrix printers.(remember those?) Nowdays Mac OS doesn’t use the old bitmap components that are present in the suitcase, but the suitcase file still needs to be intact.\n\nThis may be in the wiki...\n\n"
