Fontographer 4 is all that we have now; it was a complete rewrite of the program, broke RoboFog, etc. etc.. To make it happen the programmers would have to hack the crap out of Fog 4.x, which doesn’t work well anyway.\n\nYou could always donate money to the development of Glyphs, which is probably more up your alley than FLab: [http://schriftgestaltung.de/glyphs/about.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100301102632/http:/schriftgestaltung.de/glyphs/about.html \"http://schriftgestaltung.de/glyphs/about.html\")\n\n"
