  "content": "Here's a 'dingbat' type font we inherited as part of a magazine publisher purchase. All we know about it is that it's named Needles and that it's a Windows Postcript font. Problem is, it's incorporated in such a way to the magazine that we can't simply replace it for something else.\n\nWe're trying to do our due diligence and make sure we're using it within it's EULA. Tough to do when you can't identify it's creator. We've not had any luck ID'ing yet, so I'm hoping someone here might be able to help.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [needles-font.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122084304/http:/typophile.com/files/needles-font.gif) | 11.72 KB |\n\n",
