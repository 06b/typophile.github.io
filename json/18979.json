I am currently using Ehrhardt but it seems too heavy on the grey paper I am printing on. I think i started with Century, which again was just too heavy. I don't quite want to go with the obvious Times New Roman. Does anyone have any suggestions on faces the would lend the \"newspaper\" look to my mini-book?\n\n",
