I donâ€™t want to set a new exception to zero, I want to delete the exception and have the pair respond to the class kerning and not have a red number in it. If I delete the kern exception or type zero, I get a red zero and a new exception. If I type the value of the kern class master, then I get a red exception of the master of the same value but I can't just get the thing to go back and be a happy member of the kerning class and not an exception any more--once an exception, always an exception.\n\nI even read the manual (hard to believe as that is) and can't find an answer.\n\nChrisL\n\n",
