Does anyone know what font this is and/or where I could purchase it? I've looked at several Display and Bodoni fonts, but can't seem to match the \"i\". It's from the Ralph Lauren site: [http://global.ralphlauren.com/en-us/rlmagazine/editorial/hol12/Pages/KiernanShipka.aspx?ab=int\\_010313\\_BABYLP\\_WIDGET\\_RLMAGAZINE\\_MEETKIERNANSHIPKA\\_EXPLORENOW](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423151327/http:/global.ralphlauren.com/en-us/rlmagazine/editorial/hol12/Pages/KiernanShipka.aspx?ab=int_010313_BABYLP_WIDGET_RLMAGAZINE_MEETKIERNANSHIPKA_EXPLORENOW)\n\nThanks very much for any help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423151327im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RLpic_5559.jpg)\n\n",
