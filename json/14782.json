  "content": "Hello everyone, I’m new here. I am a type teacher turned graphic designer, living and working in Atlanta. I am also actively involved in the Cybernetic Broadcasting System (if anyone else is there). I have been a type freak since the 20th century, and this request is a final attempt to save… um… face. Okay, bad pun, :P though some help really is needed here.\n\nI have come here to seek font identification as a last resort. This one really has me stumped. It came from a photographer’s self-promo piece, is a sans-serif, and it looks European. The squarish O and Q make it resemble a FontShop typeface. The Q and the ampersand are the most distinct letters, the Q having a long and almost, but not quite, horizontal tail, whereas the ampersand is broken and does not quite match — it looks a bit funny.\n\nIt appears to be all small caps, as you can see by comparing the numbers. So it was probably made by someone who knows what they’re doing. The Q and the ampersand may be alternate characters, this is also a possibility. Other distinctions are the wobbly, pinched shape of the C and G and the apex of the M coming close to the baseline, but not touching it. The type also has a somewhat extended appearance, seen in the R and B.\n\nIt has some similarities with these, but is none of them:  \nURW Grotesk  \nCharlotte Sans  \nGill Sans  \nScala Sans  \nMyriad  \nFF Info  \nLegato  \nMeta  \nOlympia  \nLinotype Projekt  \nScene  \nStone Sans  \nThurdis Sans  \nUnit  \nUnivers  \nZwo\n\nOnline font identification has been useless, so it must be some sort of gourmet font or is perhaps very new. If it can be identified, we will probably buy it, and everyone here knows how much fun new type is. So please help. Thanks, and good luck.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [type\\_sample\\_3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=type_sample_3.jpg) | 64.78 KB |\n\n",

It also makes it tough for me to identify, but it does appear to be Medium Small Caps and Book Small Caps with the Oldstyle figures.\n\nHrant, here’s a Republican apology: I’m sorry if you don’t like the ampersand. ;-)  \nThe Italic has a very different ampersand; I’m curious to know what you think of it.\n\n"
