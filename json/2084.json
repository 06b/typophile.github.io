Odd bedfellows to be sure.   \nIt seems like all of [SoftMaker's](http://web.archive.org/web/20101017084024/http:/www.softmaker.de/fonts_en.htm) fonts are clones of other's commercial   \nofferings, but URW? I had thought they were legit. Does anyone know   \nthe relationship of these two companies, other than that they're both   \nDeutsch?   \n   \n [URW](http://web.archive.org/web/20101017084024/http:/www.urw.de/english/home.htm) doesn't offer Flanders, by that name or, as far as I could find, any   \nother. I'll be interested to see if anyone can give another, more legitimate   \nname to this this typeface.   \n   \nI obtained this font via the [Fontsite CD](http://web.archive.org/web/20101017084024/http:/www.fontsite.com/Pages/OrderForm/OrderForm1.html), which is made up mostly of URW   \nfonts.\n\n"

I'd looked at Flange in a book (Lawrence Wallis' _Modern   \nEncyclopedia of Typefaces 1960-90_ as well as Berthold's PDF   \ncatalog, but several characters, notably the A & E didn't match   \nup at all in the book and that PDF is about as useful as the   \nwebsite (not!).

      "content": "I think Berthold allowed Phil's to continue selling their fonts because it was agreed that the Phil's pricing would be identical to Berthold's. I think Adobe's bundling practices (or lack of it in some cases) meant that Berthold wasn't getting as much control over the pricing as they wanted when the new owners took over Berthold. Someone else here probably knows the story in better detail, but that's the impression I got from discussions of the Berthold ownership change I have seen in various newsgroups.\n\n"

All I know is   \nFontShop took several years to decide if they were going to   \ncarry them or not, and even then they were never included   \nin the official catalogue.
