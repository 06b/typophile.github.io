Anyone got a sharp enough eye to ID such a small sample?   \n   \nThanks!   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054645im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68924.gif)   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054645im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68925.gif)\n\n",
