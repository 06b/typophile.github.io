I was wondering who has done them before (as I have a few on my own) and who would like to contribute some of their work, sketches, and maybe a quick write-up about the process.\n\nIf you've ever done any of these, interested in doing one, or in the process of creating one, shoot me an email please to [npgraphicdesign@yahoo.com](mailto:npgraphicdesign@yahoo.com). I'll email you back with more details, why I am asking for this, etc.\n\nA short wikipedia link describing ambigrams - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram](http://web.archive.org/web/20130331031632/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram\")\n\nThese are ambigrams btw..\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130331031632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ad2_5056.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130331031632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ad1_4882.jpg)\n\n",

It boils down to \"a good idea\" (you can't just take any phrase and turn it into an ambigram), followed by a lot of work. Place an upside-down copy on a layer below your working copy; swap them at (ir)regular intervals until they are the same.\n\nAnother one, based on -- (what font was that?)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130331031632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/theun_ambi_5176.gif)\n\n"

Rather than have this blog be just a showcase of work, I would like it to be as much about the process as it is about the final product. So, this is what I'm asking the participants to contribute. I know that everyone is busy with work, life, family, etc. So submit what you can, and lets have a blast!!\n\nEmail to send the submissions to:  \n [ambigblog@gmail.com](mailto:ambigblog@gmail.com)\n\nRequired part of the submission:  \na. One ambigram in jpg/gif/tiff format. You do not have to size it down to a specific size, as I will take care of that.  \nb. A few sentences about your ambigram. Include who the client was, whether it was a personal or freelance project, and why you decided to use an ambigram for the specific project. Include a sentence or two (or three) about your thought process if you can!!  \nc. The most important part: SKETCHES! More so than the work, I'd love to see the process. So any sketches you have, whether it's 1 or 10 sketches showing the creative process, please scan them in and send them to me. I will resize them and convert them to the appropriate file format. And the sketches do not have to be perfect; they can be as doodle-esque or unorganized as you want them to be, as long as they are SOMEWHAT clear ;) If you don't have any sketches, that's perfectly fine. I would still love to have your submissions for the blog!\n\nOptional part of the submission:  \na. More than one ambigram. I would like everyone to submit at least ONE. But if you have to time to submit more than one, along with sketches, descriptions, etc., why not??\n\nInclude the following with your submissions (only if you want to!):  \na. A URL to your work (if you want people to look at your other work as well)  \nb. Your real name or a monicker (could be a forum nickname, could be another nickname, etc) but someway to identify yourselves  \n\"I will not post any of your personal contact info, email, URL, name or otherwise without your explicit permission.\"\n\nAnd finally, spread the word! I want this to be a website about ambigrams, about the process, and about networking and getting to know artists that have similar interests! If you know anyone who is interested in ambigrams, who has created them before, or wants to take a crack at it, send forward this email to them or have them shoot me an email with some questions, which I will be more than happy to answer.\n\nSome other things to be included on the website: interviews with artists and well known designers that specialize in ambigrams and typography, case studies, etc. I will shoot out periodic emails informing everyone of new developments!\n\nThanks everyone! Looking forward to all the great work!\n\nNikita\n\n"
