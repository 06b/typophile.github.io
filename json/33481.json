  "content": "Hi all-  \nI have \"lurked\" on this board for a long time. You are all so knowledgeable!\n\nI was wondering if you have any feedback on this logo for Sprinkles Cupcakes. It looks like it was a font that was just created, but I thought some of you might know if it was based on an actual font.\n\nI'd love to know your thoughts.  \nIsabella\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102100im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_3681.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Isabella, it's very hard to know whether something 'script' is a font, or hand-drawn, unless there are enough letters to see some duplicates. Even then, it can be hard to be sure, because with OpenType fonts it is possible to have alternate characters and ligatures that vary the letters. Offhand I do not recognize this, although I know there are a number of Casual or Everyday Handwriting fonts that may be similar.\n\nIf you look at the Casual Flowing Scripts in [Part 7 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102100/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html) you will see a large selection of this category of script. The other part of the Guide is [Part 9, Everyday Handwriting](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102100/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg1.html). You may find this font, or something similar to it. Then use the [Script Font Reference List](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102100/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html) to see where it comes from.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
