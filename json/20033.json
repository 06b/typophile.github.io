It can be run on both Type 1 and OpenType CFF fonts (or in FontLab on any font with PS style outlines, which can then be exported to Type 1 or OT CFF).

However, since FDK isn't like any other product by Adobe (e.g. InDesign, Photoshop - that you keep everything secret till the release ) maybe you or Thomas can shed some OpenType light.\n\nThank you.\n\n"

When AFDKO 2.0 is released, it will take some time until that code is incorporated into FontLab Studio, so in the meantime, AFDKO will have some advantage. However, from what I remember seeing at Read Roberts˚ presentation in The Hague, I don˚t think that AFDKO 2.0 will support any new lookup types.\n\nA.\n\n"

After that, there may be a delay of up to a week or two before the new FDK bits are actually posted (depends on our web team).\n\nRight now, for most people, I think the FDK is mostly some additional tools, and I don't expect most users will actually build their OT fonts using the FDK. They'll use it for proofing/testing tools, and they'll maybe use some of the scripts and plug-ins.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"
