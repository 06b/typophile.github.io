With that in mind, I felt Georgia Bold was a safe way to tie a thread between easy web-fonts and the logo itself.\n\nWith a name like “Chris” I know it doesn’t stand out much. But all attempts at my last name “Meeks” were coming up empty.\n\nFeel free to rip it apart if you like.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090509155458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/c_logo_5898.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "i’m curious why there’s a difference between the connections of the CH and the IS along the x-axis. I realize the serif of the h is there, but does it have to be? Check pic to see what im referring to.\n\nBut then that leads me into the question of the half of the stroke on the I and the top half being different weights. I see why you did it, if the bottom half is the same width the connection between that and the S loses its weight...but it still bothers me any may need some kind of adjustment.\n\nbut i like it. good use of ligatures.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090509155458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/c_logo_5898%20copy_4677.jpg)\n\n"

Raise the branch of the r and heighten the i.\n\nRemember advice is free, that tells you the value of it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090509155458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/chris_6121.png)\n\nJust keep refining until you are pleased.\n\nEdit: yes I know all the balls are different. What do you expect after a whole day with a cardiologist : )\n\nMichael\n\n"

      "content": "Some really good thoughts here, thanks everyone.\n\nTo me, those inconsistencies I created by joining the letters don’t jump out or anything. But that could just be because I am looking at it too long.\n\nLike the c-h connection actually feels like a good solid chunk to me. And cutting away that thick connection I made makes it feel awkward as a mark, though more accurate if you are thinking of the font.\n\nI like adding the ball to the end of the “s” though. I think that would be a good improvement as well. And separating the “i” could work.\n\nI’ll work with some of this stuff and get back to you all. Thanks for the advice, very nice to get feedback like this...\n\n-Chris\n\n"

      "content": "“the c-h connection actually feels like a good solid chunk to me”\n\nYes it does, but it also creates a hot spot, a dark spot that draws the eye away from the “word.” You want the viewer to digest the mark without be drawn to 1 particular facet of the mark/design. That is the reason that I suggested cutting the serifs... minimize.\n\nWhen working on a word project like this I always think in terms of the pen... keep thicks from joining thicks, unless of course it is monoline.\n\nMichael\n\n"
