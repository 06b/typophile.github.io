  "content": "Hello,  \nThis is my first time on this forum and I am new to this page. I was recently assigned a research project for typography on a type designer. The designer that I received is [John Downer](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907091832/http:/typophile.com/wiki/John%252BDowner). I am have some trouble finding the resources and information I need. The largest issue that I am having is finding information that is considered an article. I am only allowed 2 internet sources the rest have to be from articles and books and I need 6 sources total. I was looking to see if some one could point me in the right direction of where to look. I would appreciate the help.  \nThank You.\n\n [‹ Cloud font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907091832/http:/typophile.com/node/43248 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type Battle: Pumpkin Carving ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907091832/http:/typophile.com/battle19 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "There’s a passage in the Sign Painter section of the House Industries book about John Downer coming out and teaching them some stuff, try playing that one up. Also, have you tried searching _The Design and Applied Arts Index_ for articles? I find that it’s often the only useful database for tracking down good stories about designers, especially type designers. If your school library doesn’t have access to that database, get the librarian to direct to a library that does. Because you’re in New York you have access to some great libraries, so get out there and ask the librarians to help you look stuff up. You should see if the [TDC](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907091832/http:/tdc.org/) library has some stuff!\n\nIf you still have trouble, try printing all the good internet articles you can find by or about John and showing them to your professor, and pointing out that in a field as esoteric as type design, sometimes the internet is a better resource than a library. Also, check online articles carefully, sometimes they are reprints of articles that appeared in obscure magazines that aren’t in libraries, so you can just cite the original magazine.\n\n"
