This is a recreation of the 19th century fat faces which pushed the Didone style to the max for impact in advertising purposes. The style included extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes and a large scale lower case. Lambert is an outstanding designer and I prefer his version to most other recreations of the style.\n\nDon\n\n"

The effect is shown in two Bodoni's: [Bodoni Highlight](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018224601/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/bodoni-highlight/) and [Spotlight](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018224601/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/spotlight-2/) but neither has the highlights in locations that match GELATO.  \nAlternatively, the logo designer could have started with Annlie Extra Bold, Sahara Bodoni or another version and edited to produce a highlighted GELATO.\n\nDon\n\n"
