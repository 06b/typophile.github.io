      "content": "What is the intended use of the font?\n\nUnless technical limitations require a single font to support all scripts and languages (for example in an interface font), the best and really the only solution is to match different fonts for each of the scripts.\n\nEnglish and Turkish use the Latin script, as does Somali nowadays. Arabic and Urdu use the Arabic script, although they are usually written in different styles (Nasta'liq for Urdu, Naskh for Arabic).\n\nThe Somali Latin alphabet doesn't seem to require special diacritics, so I would say you need a Latin design that supports the Turkish characters (ç, ğ, ı, ö, ş, ü) and Arabic designs for the Arabic and Urdu languages that are compatible with each other. Then you'd be set.\n\nThe Latin and Arabic scripts have different metric requirements and are written in different directions, so there really is no reason for you to use a single font to support them both. In fact you really shouldn't use a single font for both. I'm sure other Typophiles will point you to some good Arabic-Latin combinations, but even those combinations that are designed to work together side by side in multi-script settings usually come in different fonts, as far as I am aware.\n\n"

It's for a magasin that comes in five different languages, so they should look similar.\n\nThanx again  \nJsbr\n\n"
