      "content": "As usual, very hard to say with such a work. Manually sheared? Originally unicase? Customization of an existing font? Freebie?  \nWhat I could say is it feels \"freebie\" to me. I can only suggest you to have a look to some sections at DaFont. This would be long but might work: [Techno \\> Sci-fi](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823073936/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303) and [Techno \\> Various](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823073936/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304)  \nHope this helps...\n\n"
