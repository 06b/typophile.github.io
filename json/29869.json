Im designing a logo and have been experimenting with Areplos... which I really like.\n\nThe company is B2B, high tech, makes interactive sales tools for Merchandising companies.  \nMost of these companies in the consumer electronics field.\n\nSo, Ive used Areplos and it really looks fab... now I'd be interested in seeing if I could couple it with another face.  \nPerhaps a face that is just a touch less serif....... maybe not.\n\nIf a complimentary face to Areplos comes to mind, let me know... and thx!\n\n",
