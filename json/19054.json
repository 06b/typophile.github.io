More recently applied also to the Spanish _tilde_ or circumflex over _ñ_, formerly to the cedilla under _ç_. By extension, any stroke or tick with a pen.  \n**b.** The dot over the letter _i_; a punctuation mark; a diacritic point over a letter; any one of the Hebrew and Arabic vowel-points and accents; also, a pip on dice.  \n**†c.** A name for the (usually) three dots, following the letters and contractions, in the alphabet on horn-books, where it is usually followed by _Est Amen_; so that **_tittle est Amen_** came to be used for ‘the end or conclusion’. _Obs._\n\netc...\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster’s stopped working.\n\n"
