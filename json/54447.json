What would be appropriate to replicate the feel of the typefaces used here?  \nOther advice for typefaces of similar feel is welcome, it's on a sonata by him.\n\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\n\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end,\n\nEach changing place with that which goes before\n\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\n\nNativity, once in the main of light,\n\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith, being crowned,\n\nCrooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight\n\nAnd Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.\n\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth,\n\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty's brow,\n\nFeeds on the rarities of natures truth,\n\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow;\n\nAnd yet, to times, in hope, my verse shall stand,\n\nPraising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\n\n",
