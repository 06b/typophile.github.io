[http://www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123232942/http:/www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/index.html)   \n   \nHowever, FF Kozmik is not a handwriting font, but hand-printing.   \n   \nSeveral handwriting fonts have been developed that use elaborate contextual rules which produce a variable effect similar to randomness, though in fact it is deterministic. One is Linotype's Zapfino, in the AAT TrueType version of the font that ships with Mac OS X. I am having difficulty finding a good link to something that explains its contextual goodies, however.   \n   \nTwo other contextual-letterform type families are Caflisch Script Pro (Robert Slimbach after Max Caflisch) and Bickham Script (Richard Lipton after George bickham). These two are in OpenType format, and can display their functionality in applications such as Illustrator CS and InDesign. By way of example, Caflisch Script Pro has 12 different forms for the lowercase \"p,\" and picks one depending on the context.   \n   \nFor more information on OpenType, see [http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123232942/http:/www.adobe.com/type/opentype).

Kosmik uses postscript programming. I played around one weekend and tried to create the same effect using open type programming, but i'm no programming whiz, so i haven't figgered it out yet. I was opperating on the following premise (which may be faulty as well since logic is not my forte either) have three sets of glyphs for each character: class A, class B & class C. Define the OT substitution rules so that AA becomes AB BB becomes BC CC becomes CA, ad nauseum (infinitum, whatev!) Supposing i could get the programming right would this work???

Moving beyond, this process, once formalized, could be used to design fonts which are not mimics of handwriting, but something else again.   \n   \nAnd secondly: If one wanted to mimic the inconsistent quality of letterpress type, which is admirable when subtle, giving it life, rather than the dull predictability of high-res digital type, then one could arrange a \"type tray\" of glyphs, where each character has variants that are \"worn\" differently, or \"print\" differently (simulating arterfacts in paper or printing), and selected at random.   \n   \nAnd is there not an element of randomness (effected by a lack of total control) in the design variants that occur between different type sizes in foundry type?\n\n"
