  "content": "I've just got to Reading. Does anyone have advice/warnings/anecdotes?\n\nI'm in Halls, and it's Freshers' Week, a ludicrously repetitive series of group pleasures meant to ensure the mental comfort of the newest students. The psychological incompetence, the crudity of imagination, that must inform this program's design are still more frightening than its results. No means of rational intercourse is permitted the children bussed and goaded into Fez, or to the Union, whose wailing is obscured by recorded music and whose inexpensive drinks are salted with tears. Often two of the taller lads, perhaps bemused by love, begin to fight; a shorter friend, preferring, as he must, civility to strength, \"breaks them up\"; but - watch out! - one of the young pugilists in retreating knocks an unobserved fat girl, or a lurching mathematician: her purple-flavoured ale is spilt, his dead-pan seduction curtailed. What must ugly or intelligent undergraduates make of it? Presumably the poor things they just blame themselves for not loving it, or getting laid, as much as they assume they ought.\n\nSelfishly I'm alright, since the School of Typography is of course a miracle of scholarship and moral grandeur. There must also be lots of civilized postgrads in all subjects: any tips on how to find them?\n\n",
