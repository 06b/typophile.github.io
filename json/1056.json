      "content": "apparently, I got the image right, but the text is gone...   \nso, here comes the brief: this is the rough sketch I did for a russian client, ang he liked the logotype enough to drop the suggested symbol.   \nhowever, there are things bothering me about the overall balance. maybe you could suggest some tunings to make it look better.   \nand the second issue: though there are only a few letters displayed here, do you think these have potential to be extended into a full character set? do you have any recollection of similar fonts?   \n   \nthank you all,   \n   \ngeorge // cellsius creative   \n   \nP.S. this is my first attempt at designing lower cases. please, don't be too harsh :-)\n\n"

      "content": "As shapes, I like it. What's the company about?   \n   \nAs a logo, it might need to be a bit darker, but the \"e\" and \"a\" are already too cramped, so try making the \"n\" (especially) and the \"c\" and \"o\" narrower. The thing at the bottom of the \"el\" is too subtle, and as a result out of character too - but don't make it curl (it would create more color problems) - just make it straight. The \"c\" is structurally superb, just make the top-right curve more round and remove the slight flare from the bottom finial.   \n   \nI think it could work as a font. If you go that way, do something original with the caps (maybe uncial forms), since your \"a\" is already unconventional (and we already have a lot of boring caps).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The Metsys \"n\" is really nice, I think it could really helps define the \"a\" as the rounded \"a\" you did is perhaps a bit illegible without the context of the rest of the surrounding letters. I would also widen the \"e\" and \"a\" as shown. Hope I was of some help.   \n ![Elanco mods.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417072616im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1495.jpg)\n\n"

Because   \nof this, and only in my opinion, the last three   \ncharacters seem less important. hmmm. Need the   \nright words.   \n   \n(pause)   \n   \nBecause the 'e' and the 'a' have so much   \ncharacter, the focus, through my eyes only perhaps,   \nisn't evenly distributed(?). Or in   \nother words, the logo looks to be only   \nthose three letters because of this visual   \nemphasis.\n\n"
