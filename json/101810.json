The main performance problem was the size of the resultant HTML file! So an actual font was -and I suspect still must be- the only way to make this sing.\n\nBut this is all probably pointless anyway. Text size is too variable these days. Hmmm, unless a hand-made grayscale (or even better, subpixel) bitmap font can be rendered by collaging small hand-made elements that can be slid around, scaled, layered, to produce a range of sizes from a single master set... Man, I really have to stop thinking like a hacker.\n\nhhp\n\n"
