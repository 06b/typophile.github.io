      "content": "I don't know if it's based on a font, more probably a custom logo work. It looks too much modified/customized to me. The only letter that could be original is probably /A. You just need to spot a good Egyptian/geometric slab serif ( [Sommet Slab](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sommet-slab)... and play with it. My choice would probably be to start with a Sans and add slab serifs, something from [Type-Together](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071559/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Type-Together) such as [Soleil](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/soleil), [Karmina Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/karmina-sans) or [Etica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/etica).  \nFor the rest, as \"Worldline\" baseline is set in [Stag](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071559/http:/vllg.com/Schwartzco/Stag), you could even start with this one.\n\n"
