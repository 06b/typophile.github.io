  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’ve always used mainly Macs--never had a PC at home--but recently I’ve been thinking about switching to a PC and to Windows (mainly because the hardware is so much cheaper and freely combinable and the support is easier to get).\n\nSo I’d like to ask this: which platform is really better for a typophile? I know that graphic designers have traditionally used Macs, but the focus there tends to be in images and color, not typography.\n\nI do plan to do some photo scanning and image editing, but that’s basically as a hobby, at least for now. My planned focus is in book composition with InDesign and, as an auxiliary to this, font editing with FontLab Studio (so I’m neither a real type designer nor a font production kind of guy). I might also use Illustrator e.g. to draw graphs from imported data. (You can’t do that in FL--but are there better programs for this?).\n\nOne aspect of typography is text display on screen. Windows has ClearType, but I have the impression that it doesn’t affect the way InDesign and other Adobe apps display text. Am I right?\n\nThere seem to be differences in OS-level OpenType support as well, but how much does that really matter for InDesign/Illustrator composition?\n\nAlso, from my experience with Windows XP it seems that the look of that OS is more freely customizable (I dislike the unnecessarily complicated look of Tiger, where everything is transparent and shaded). If I remember correctly, you can change the font, and most importantly the font size, of menus etc. It seems stupid that you can’t use the full resolution of your display (OK, my current one is quite bad anyway) because you’d then be unable to read any text and symbols outside the document/image window itself.\n\nOf course, the comparison might be a little difficult or unfair at the moment because Mac OS X Leopard hasn’t been released yet; on the Windows side, I’d presumably use Vista (which I haven’t even seen “live” yet).\n\n(I also know that doing serious font production, you’d have to use both platforms, if only for testing. But as I said, that is not really my field.)\n\nI may be a little naive here, but **I don’t want to start another platform war.** I would just like to hear rational arguments for and against each platform. As you can probably tell form the above, I’m not very tech-savvy myself, and I would therefore appreciate your insights.\n\nI must also say that the switch doesn’t seem quite as real an option for me now as it did when I first thought about starting this thread. One reason is the difficulty of cross-platform software switches/upgrades. (FontLab for one said they could only offer me a 30% second-copy discount. I haven’t asked Adobe yet.) Another reason is simple familiarity; and then there is the virus situation, of course, as I’ve known all along … But my hardware (and thus platform) situation is basically still open--and I thought this would be a fun thread to start anyway, in an open-minded spirit!\n\nOlli\n\n",

      "content": "You seem to be in my line of work -- book composition, with the need to do font work in FontLab, and do image work in Photoshop. We're even moving to InDesign.\n\nAs to platforms, what I would suggest is to determine which platform is most apt to maintain support for programs you need, unless you want to add programing work to font work. For the basic programs this isn't an issue, it is additional programming you might need. An example might be High Dynamic Range Compression as a plug-in for Photoshop (something better than the little routine you get in Photoshop CS2 by going up to 32 bit & then back down to 16 bit).\n\nBy in large, most software is now written for Windows, and adapted for the Mac, for the simple reason that that the PC market is bigger.\n\nToo, most authors write on a PC -- same reason. On the other side of the coin, most graphic designers work on Macintosh, so if you wanted to share files -- at least before InDesign & OpenType -- that meant a Mac. Of course, sometimes it's nice to say \"sorry, we can't share files.\"\n\nI've been doing this kind of work since 1980, and over the long haul, find these more important matters in book composition than the things you mention.\n\nOne note: I don't think you can judge type on the screen. Printing it out on a laser printer is the minimal step, and you don't really <cite>know</cite> what it looks like until the printed book comes in. If the publisher doesn't provide a complimentary copy, see of they'll sell you one at a discount. This will better help you judge word spacing, and any changes you make to a font.\n\nAlso, if you're preparing the art, you better learn the papers the books will be printed on, and determine the dotgain for both particular paper(s) and printer(s). If that's too much, at least the different kinds of papers, & a few grades -- with uncoated paper, offwhite & white, various grades of matt coated stocks, & glossy coated. But always best to work with the actual sheet being used.\n\n"

But it still helps if you can easily read the type on screen (without zooming in) and if the look is as close to the real thing as possible.\n\nThe paper does, of course, affect even the look of type.

The amount of money for truly comparable systems is not enough to be an issue. Higher monitor resolution reduces pixel size on both platforms so that is a wash.
