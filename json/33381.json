  "content": "Hi, I am new here, so please have patience ;) thanks\n\nMy company would like to start a new magazine. It will be readable from both sides - one half is for men and one half for women. You have to turn it around and upside down to view the other side (if you understand what I mean).  \nAnyway. I am something like a manager of this project and our “art director” sucks. I tried to find some solution, because we are close to deadline. I know that it also sucks (but believe me - it is better). I am not graphic and there is no typography involved, but I hope, that you will help me to improve the general image and the “face” of the magazine and layout...\n\nHere are first three pages, that will be used for text-type pages\n\n[http://ahasver.wz.cz/strana-plain.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070922000912/http:/ahasver.wz.cz/strana-plain.jpg)  \n [http://ahasver.wz.cz/strana-foto.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070922000912/http:/ahasver.wz.cz/strana-foto.jpg)  \n [http://ahasver.wz.cz/strana-velky-foto.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070922000912/http:/ahasver.wz.cz/strana-velky-foto.jpg)\n\nthanks for any suggestions\n\n [‹ Book design: your critique welcome](http://web.archive.org/web/20070922000912/http:/typophile.com/node/27817 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Magazine Redesign — font ideas? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070922000912/http:/typophile.com/node/33419 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "With strana-velky-foto.jpg you reveal one of the problems of including the graphic by changing text color: as the columns rewrap, the shape can get distorted. I don’t much care for changing the text color as it also introduces readability issues, but if you must do it try overlaying a translucent graphic object over the text instead of changing the text color. With that, you’ll run into the problem of a few letters being only partially changed, but you will save a lot of time over resetting the text color letter by letter.\n\nThat being said, it isn’t a bad layout, but it is indeed a rather boring one, more appropriate to a serious medical journal than a lifestyle magazine.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with jason’s assessment, particularly regarding the graphic/text relationship.  \nAlthough I might suggest the translucent graphic BEHIND the text instead of in front.  \n You may also rethink the elements in the open column to the left. I get the feeling that by rrunning the author credit at the top of the column and the one column photo at the bottom, you’re negating the openness of the layout. Instead, it might be worth trying to group the author credits and the secondary image closer together, and letting the free space fall to the bottom left. It will really open the page up more.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070922000912im_/http:/typophile.com/files/strana_6637.jpg)\n\n"

Actually I don’t care for the male/female symbol behind or in front of text at all. It takes away from the text and meaning. It is simply too obtrusive. Why not a little symbol, light in color, in the open column under the caption or at bottom of page. Does it have to be so obvious?\n\n"

Unless you really need to drive it home which side (venus-mars) we’re reading. But as Hrant suggests, using differing faces could do the same thing with perhaps more communication, such as a sans serif for masculine and serif for feminine sides...\n\n"
