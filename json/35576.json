      "content": "Well, I was in a similar situation, and the gallery was in a museum district.\n\nI decided to try and use that larger context. I also looked at the range of shows—which included everything from contemporary international art to period artifacts like clothing and furniture.\n\nI decided to pick a contemporary serif and combine that with more traditional sans so the publications etc. could shift in feel and remain within the identity.\n\nI think Pentagram’s work for the DMA is very solid, using Fedra Sans is very nice.  \n [http://a.velluminous.org/dma.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20071230035014/http:/a.velluminous.org/dma.html \"http://a.velluminous.org/dma.html\")\n\nMaybe a family like OurType’s Fresco and Fresco Sans would work. It would probably function well for wayfinding and identity, and have a serif option for extended text in a catalogue.\n\n"
