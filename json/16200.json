      "content": "Interesting, I'm not sure it works, on first read I saw MWILO. Leaving that aside, the L seems too narrow; the O looks out of place, maybe you could try using a break like the A or B; the S needs some work, it appears to be tilting to the left. Does the M need that upright, because I think that is contributing to the MW reading problem. I think you can make it work but it will take a creative solution.  \nTim\n\n"

I don't quite like the S to be honest I think I still need to work on the overall shape. As for the MM/MW thing, It's something that has been worrying me for a bit and I'm caught as a cross-roads as to how to deal with it. The original reason why I put in the upright stem on the M was to make sure it wasn't confused for a W once it was flipped, but I suppose that could have proved detrimental.\n\nI'll put up some more variations as soon as I'm able. In the meantime any other comments are appreciated.\n\n-mmilo\n\n"

For now I am only working on the MMILO part because that seems to be the area that requires the most attention.\n\nI am also toying with the idea of small embellishments to suggest the idea of rotation.

I'm mainly interested in web design and vector based illustration, but I dabble in Flash programming, typography, conceptual illustration and digital painting. That's why there is a \"labs\" suffixed on to the name because the site is mainly about me experimenting with different ideas.\n\nThe website has three goals:  \n1. Outlet for general experimentation  \n2. Showcasing some work  \n3. Putting up a portfolio so I can hopefully find some sort of employment after my degree is completed.\n\nI'm sorry I was vague about what I was trying to accomplish, but I hope I have given enough of a back story now for people to get a better idea of what the concept behind the logo is.\n\n-mmilo\n\n"

Whatever you make I want to encourage you to make sure it works in B&W first and then think about color. I think this one feels like SF, CA in the the early 90's just because I associate the face with that time. BTW - what about just scanning a ballpoint pen or pencil sketch? Or some other one-off method. Whipped cream?\n\nDoing something like that would reflect an experimental nature more than a formal logo.\n\n"

As much as I liked the interlocking M's there's not much point when noone will understand what the logo is sayng. That's why I'm trying out different avenues to find what will strike the best balance.\n\nIf you guys have any thoughts, or can think of any logos that fit in with what I'm trying to accomplish let me know :)\n\nAgain thanks for the keen interest guys, I will most definately keep working on this, I'm having a blast doing this with your help.\n\n-mmilo\n\n"

My eye has a hard time resolving them into anything, and as a result I read them as ornamentation of a sort, like a visual foil for the 'i' so I read it as 'ilo:labs' now.\n\nI prefer the second one because you have more forms to work with. I'd suggest making each 'm' distinct and using that first leg with the sharp corner twice, once for each 'm'. Also, the light grey might be a bit too light, depending on how much control you have over its use.\n\n"

I am looking foreward to the next iteration. BTW - maybe you should work in just b/w and leave the grey & color to later on.\n\nWhat if gave the m a sort of Lead-in on the left side, almost like a serif in the text m. Or you could take your 'a' make a copy, flip it horizontally & have a kind of ram's head m that uses the roundness of the other letters again. Actually I made some m's just for fun.
