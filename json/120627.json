  "content": "Someone here recommended a font site where readers could  \ndownload 10,000 or 20,000 fonts for $20. They said the creator  \nof each font had approved their fonts for download on this site,  \nthat each font creator received compensation for each download.\n\nI foolishly gave this site my credit card information. I was not  \nable to download anything. I contacted the site for a refund, but  \nI received no response. What a ripoff!\n\nI am looking for a list of the best knockoffs of famous commercial fonts,  \nespecially for the fonts I list below. The US Supreme Court ruled that  \nfont design cannot be copyrighted. Those who create a font, can  \ntrademark the name of their font name, but they can't copyright  \nthe actual design. Hence, there are many legal knockoffs of standard  \ncommercial fonts. I will pay good money for a list of these knockoffs,  \nand where to legally download them.\n\nMicrosoft did not license the fonts they used in MS Office. Ariel is a  \nknockoff of Helvetica; Segue is a knockoff of Frutiger; Book Antiqua  \nis a knockoff of Palantino. Microsoft did not license any of the fonts  \nthey include in MS Word.\n\nI think they did pay Hermann Zapf to create Constantia which is a  \nknock-off of his Palantino.\n\nUS courts ruled font names could be trademarked, but their design could  \nnot legally be copyrighted. European courts acknowledge the right of font  \ncreators to copyright their font.\n\nIn the meantime, I still need 100 commercial fonts for  \n NON-COMMERCIAL USE.  \nIf I use any font for commercial use I will pay the creator  \nof the font for its use.\n\nI am willing to pay anyone here up to $1,000 for their help.  \nMy email address is [cyberflor@aol.com](mailto:cyberflor@aol.com). For example, I  \nwould pay $30/month for a font family/month.\n\nI am looking for complete font families of: Mrs. Eaves (by Zuzana Licko),  \nBaskerville, Helvetica Neue, Avenir Next Pro (Neue), Adobe Garamond,  \nMyriad Pro, Caslon, Univers, Futura, Hoelfer Text, Fruitiger Next, Gotham,  \nMinion Pro, Akzidenz Grotesk, Didot, Shelley Allegro, Thesis Sans,  \nGill Sans, Din, Lucida, Trade Gothic, Cacon, Zapfino, Trajan, Interstate,  \nBell Gothic, Agency, Optima, Perpetua, Proxima Nova, Avenir, Meta,  \nPalatino Nova, Palatino Sans, and Michaelangelo Titling. I am open  \nto suggestions for additional fonts.\n\nI am not in business. I am not a graphic designer. I am not a desktop  \npublisher. I am disabled. I receive disability. I have no savings.  \nI have no income aside from $700/month disability income. I own  \nMS Word 2013 student edition. I am expert in the use of MS Word.\n\nI would like to learn Adobe In-Design. I would be interested in  \npurchasing an old version of Adobe In-design. I can teach myself  \nanything.\n\nIf anyone would like to help me start I business, or partner with me  \nin some business, that would be great. I have created a few resume  \ndesigns that job seekers might purchase.\n\nI am a proficient technical writer. I could also possibly work as a  \nparalegal. I think I could earn money working in desktop publishing.\n\nFind me work, and earn a percentage of my income.\n\n",

Ray Larabie and James Arboghast did recommend the Ultimate Font Download site in the [Is this legit?](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020182650/http:/www.typophile.com/node/52360) thread. I don't know a lot about free fonts, but I doubt you'll find knock-offs, or at least legal knockoffs of approximately the same completeness and quality as the original, of the typefaces you want. Making a good knockoff legally would require too much work and offer too little glory for people to do it for free, and doing it commercially probably wouldn't pay now either since knockoffs have a bad reputation with designers and good type can be had relatively cheaply.\n\nUntil you can evaluate type confidently for things like spacing issues, you might want to avoid free fonts and knockoffs at least for use in extended text. A copy of _The Elements of Typographic Style_ could be a good investment, if you've not yet read it, since it'll help you use more effectively what you already have - including Constantia, which was designed from scratch by John Hudson, who is on this forum.\n\n"

If you are already a good writer, I'd suggest concentrating on that rather than learning desktop publishing, which is a complex skill to learn. (Unless you mean just creating simple documents like resumes. And you don't need InDesign for those, Word will work just fine.)\n\nMany (but certainly not all) copywriter jobs are \"clean up\" jobs, where you're given rough copy written by a client and you must polish it. It requires a good knowledge of grammar, good organizational skills to keep track of revisions and deadlines, good proofreading skills, and good people skills so your clients enjoy working with you and send you more jobs.\n\n\\> I would like to learn Adobe In-Design.\n\nBe aware that InDesign is a very complex program and many of the settings require a good knowledge of typography. It's a difficult program to learn.\n\n\\> purchasing an old version of Adobe In-design.\n\nUsed copies aren't always easy to find because when a new version comes up, folks buy the \"upgrade\" version which requires that you still have the old version, and they may keep the old version in case they need to reinstall the new version again. And a \"used\" copy might be a pirated version that won't operate properly as you must go through a registration process with Adobe.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for your reply.\n\nI don't need the same completeness as the commercial font.  \nI was hoping some private designers with time on their hands  \nmight be able produce respectable knock-offs with quality  \napproaching or exceeding the commercial font.\n\nWe often see free software programs that are quite good. Not  \neveryone is motivated by money and glory. But if there are no  \ndecent knock-offs, then there aren't.\n\nFonts should be sold for non-commercial use at a lower price  \nthan when they are sold for commercial use.\n\nI don't know why there is not a font package of basic fonts for  \nnon-commercial use. I would pay $500-$1000 for such a package.\n\nIn the meantime, anyone can get any commercial font for free  \nby going downloading it from file-sharing pirate sites. This is  \nnot something I know how to do because I am not into that. I  \nam close to paying a computer expert to do this for me.\n\nI read many places that Constantia was a Microsoft commissioned  \nknock-off of Palantino. Which do people like more Palantino Linotype,  \nBook Antiqua, or Constantia?\n\nWhich of these fonts looks most impressive for a business letter:  \nPalantino Linotype, Book Antiqua, Constantia, Baskerville, Goudy  \nOld Style. I use Baskerville, but the difference between these fonts  \nis very hard to discern on my monitor. I am not sure that my printer  \neven prints them differently. Which would you prefer for legal  \nwork?\n\nAt one point I thought of purchasing an old Adobe software product  \njust to get their fonts.\n\nThank you for your recommendation. I will purchase The Elements  \nof Typographic Style when I can afford it. At this point in time, I can't  \nspare one dollar. I don't have working refrigerator.\n\nYou say a good type can be had relatively cheaply now, but the last time  \nI checked a family of single font cost several thousand dollars. I would  \nreally like to get Avenir Next, Mrs. Eaves by Licko, Myriad Pro,  \nGaramond, Futura and a few others.\n\nI can't see how using these fonts in my personal letters would cost the  \ncreators of these fonts, or their foundries one penny. I created  \nbusiness presentations to try to get investors interested in partnering  \nwith me.\n\nIf I owned a print shop, an advertising company, or a desktop publishing  \ncompany, and I had real income, I have no problem paying the going rate  \nfor these fonts. If I created a font, I would have no problem with anyone  \nin my situation using it for free. I spent my life helping people in need or  \ndistress for free. I made huge personal sacrifices to help humans and  \nanimals in distress.\n\nWhen I think how many people there are in the world, who would object  \nto the poor benefiting from something that would not cause them any loss,  \nI think to myself that I have been a fool, that sociopaths have a better  \ngrasp of reality than I have. I always thought mankind would advance  \nwhen humans helped each other reach their full potential. But successful  \npeople overwhelming seem to believe the world is a zero-sum game,  \nthat they lose anytime anyone else gets ahead.\n\nEvery time I read news about some \"senseless\" killing, and I recall how  \nsuccessful humans are by and in large so petty, selfish, self-centered,  \nnarcissistic, and greedy, I think to myself there is no such thing as  \nsenseless murders. Senseless murderers are no different than most  \nsuccessful human beings. Both sets are comprised of humans who  \njust care about their own welfare, and their own selfish needs.\n\nWhy should impoverished humans give a whit about others, when  \nothers do not give a whit about them. The social contract is built  \non the principle of \"reciprocity.\" I care about you, society cares  \nabout you, therefore you should respect our laws.\n\nWhen a society does not give a whit about its poor, its needy, and  \nits hungry. When people who are successful can't stand anyone else  \ngaining, even when it costs them nothing, there is no social contract.\n\nWhat does this have to do with fonts and typography? Apparently,  \nmuch more than meets the eye. The \"haves,\" people with land, oil,  \nmoney, power, fonts want to keep their club exclusive. They want  \nto preserve their privilege, they do not wish to share with others,  \neven if it would cost them nothing to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, I have always believed in sharing everything  \nwith everyone. I have always been willing to share my knowledge,  \nshare my talents, share my possessions with anyone and everyone.\n\nNot everyone in the world is motivated by money and glory. Some  \npeople actually live their life to benefit the world and help others.  \nI don't think most people can imagine what kind of world we would  \nlive in today if there had been fewer self-sacrificing humans in our  \npast, and more humans who just care about their own bottom line.\n\nAll the good we have in our world today is here because of people  \nlike Tesla and Westinghouse, not people like Edison and JP Morgan.\n\n"

Obviously, I can tell the difference between \"Comic\" and \"Times Roman.\" But I really have a hard time telling the difference between Palantino, Book Antiqua, and Constantia.\n\nI have zero training in this field. I am not a graphic designer or a typographer. I have zero ability to judge fonts that are similar to each other. I can't judge spacing, character width, or any of the variations that differentiate one serif font from another serif font.\n\nI might plunk down $20 on a font, then after much use discover something about it I don't like. Then buy another font for $20 with the same result. I can see myself two years from now having spent thousands of dollars on hundreds of fonts, and not having one I am happy with. I fear buying any font that is not a famous commercial font because it might have some fatal flaw. Moreover, there are several hundred thousand cheap fonts and free fonts, I would not know where to start. The prospect of my having to select ten fonts from all those fonts is daunting and overwhelming.\n\nIf I had more experience with fonts. If fonts were a more central part of my life, I might feel more comfortable picking a cheap font or a free font. In areas where I have expertise, I can spot things that others would not notice after days of examination. Typography is your field of expertise not mine. Simply put, I am not qualified, nor do I have the competency or expertise to determine the suitability of cheap fonts or free fonts. The whole point here is I am trying to produce material with a professional look. I can't rely on my expertise to make decent selections.\n\nWith successful commercial fonts, I know I can't go wrong with any of them. And there are a few of them I have seen so often, I know I like them. I am open to recommendations.\n\nWhy don't the typographers here come up with a list of 50 low cost fonts they would recommend to budding graphic designers. Of course, I am not even a budding graphic designer. But it would certainly be a huge help to the public if all the participants here rated a hundred affordable fonts, then pared the list down to 50, 25, or even 10.\n\nI would appreciate all the time and effort you put into such an endeavor. You could even profit from it. People would pay you to come up with a list of 100, 50, 25, and 10 top affordable/free fonts.\n\nmichael\n\n"

Since you're not a trained designer most of your work will be resumes, flyers, and other simple projects, and all you need for those are a few basic fonts. The fonts you already have are probably sufficient.\n\nIf you occasionally need an unusual font (for a Halloween flyer, for example) there are plenty of free fonts out there.
