  "content": "Hello I am currently studying typography at LCC and have been stumped by the following:\n\nI am currently designing a small poetry book containing all my strange junk mail (example below). As I receive this via e-mail I would like the face to somehow reflect that, but I would like this book set out in a classic poetry book style. I would prefer to use a serif font, any advice or comments on this would be great.\n\nSo far I have stuck to my usual faces such as Garamond, Minion, Bembo etc... all of which do not carry the ’technological’ aspect....? I’m stuck!\n\nExample text..  \n“Mitch wagner stumble, elizabeth judge spooner.  \nBea oracle join sponsor ee jason westradigg month ejb.  \nHalf limited bott student standard, items suggestion?

Could be very nice for poetry.\n\nElectra is a gorgeous little typeface and Dwiggins holds a special place in my heart. But, it is overused. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t use it, but that it has been done and it might be a more worthy challenge to use Kepler. Especially if you have the optical version. Do you?\n\n"

I have laid all faces out VERY roughly so I don’t want to shock you with their lack of leading etc at the moment... but Kepler and Electra are the winners (minion is doing well, however chaparral looks awful, too heavy). I may try a few more tests, see how far I can push them... Ill keep you posted.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
