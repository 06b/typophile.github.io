      "content": "This seems sort of vague. Or maybe it's that there's too many of them these days to pick out just a few?   \n   \nI guess when you say \"idiosyncratic\" you have to explain if you mean with respect to typographic tradition (which would mean like most of the Emigre library for example), or maybe instead with respect with the functional needs of type - I'm talking about the need for each glyph to fit with all the others in the font. So for example NotCaslon would qualify for the first but not the second, since its glyphs are well-integrated.   \n   \nDunno...   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I'm gonna put the 'IT' contributions in my thesis.   \nIT is also the Internet code for Italy, quite funny.   \nThank you for the adjective \"elaborate\", Yves Peters, that makes me hopeful;   \nsmart line mr Nick Shinn; mr Papazian's, precisely, with respect with the functional   \nneeds of type, just merci!   \nTo the next one.\n\n"

      "content": "Perhaps I am looking at it backwards. I am seeing a type with idiosyncracies. To me, this is a type with quirks, a type with glyphs or parts of glyphs which break either the patterrn of form seemingly developed in the rest of the font or even different from the \"norm\" of all typefaces we know. It is like seeing a double-take in film�you are not quite sure that what you saw was \"really\" what you saw so you look again to confirm it.   \nWhen I first saw text set in \"The Mix,\" I had to look twice to see if had only partial serifs. On second viewing, it was clear to me that Luc had a very deliberate system going and today I would not say The Mix was idiosyncratic. Even joke fonts like \"Ransomnote\" (which has a different font for each character) is not idiosyncratic because it is consistent in its inconsistency. Rotis, on the other hand, drives me crazy with its lower case \"e\"�I would call Rotis idiosyncratic but most people wouldn't even notice.   \n   \nChris L\n\n"

Some designers most   \ncertainly have idiosyncracies that come through in their type   \ndesigns. Sometimes not easy to pinpoint, more of a feel I think.   \n   \nkris.\n\n"
