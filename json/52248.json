  "content": "I'll be using this blog from now on to post about my typographic musings, probably frequently on type design and signage, with a mix of user science. Most importantly, I'll be using this blog so that I won't forget to work on my typefaces, which I really need for my portfolio. I need ten works, with at least two hand-drawn or hand-painted among the bunch. I don't know how to paint, nor do I know how to draw skillfully with the pen (or pencil).\n\nI need the portfolio so that I may apply for the Information Design major in our university. Right now, I am taking up Computer Science. So if I get accepted, I will be taking two majors at the same time.\n\nWish me luck, random reader.\n\n",
