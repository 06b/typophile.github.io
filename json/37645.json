  "content": "Hi all,\n\nis there any known design studio, I could immagine in Paris, that is specialized in doing custom made font elaborations for fashion logotypes for perfume packaging and so on? I mean often you see special refined things done by the great masters of fashion industry Armani, Valentino etc. and I wonder who is doing it. Is there THE ONE studio somewhere?  \nI know Bianco&Cucco (formerly I think) at Milan. And then there is Baron but I heard something vague about a specialized studio for packaging in Paris. Maybe they do something like this also. But I don’t recall its name.\n\nThanks for information  \nStefan\n\n [‹ FontLab problem with naming glyphs](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007175858/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37644 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Rolling Stone v/s Hippie ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007175858/http:/www.typophile.com/node/2804 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
