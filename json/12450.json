If the current size is 9 pt., 10 or 11 would be an improvement.\n\nJust testing with HTML e-mail, the Georgia at 10 pt with 1 1/2 line leading doesn’t look bad. 11 pt is even better in size to me, but 1 1/2 lines is too loose at this size. I don’t know how much flexibility you have in leading with HTML\n\nAgain, a measure of not over 75 characters per line is definitely better. The measure and leading and contrast are probably more important than type size, but 9 point for extended text is just a strain for my old eyes.\n\nI agree with Stephen Coles that the background should be lightened to increase contrast with the type.\n\nI am looking at an LCD screen with a resolution of 96 dpi.\n\n"

I know there’s a pretty consistent cross-platform relationship between points and pixels these days but that still doesn’t take screen size/resolution into account. Using relative ‘em’ or ‘%’ measures would allow users to adjust text sizes in the browser.\n\n"

I’d either target 1280 outright (not recommended) or make it like 5% narrower.\n\nhhp\n\n"
