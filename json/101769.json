It looks pretty Futura-like, but I'm most interested in identifying the italic (though that uppercase G in the Roman is really lovely...).\n\nCan anyone help with identification or some similar fonts/faces?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MechanicsAndHandicraftTypeSample.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725093944/http:/typophile.com/files/MechanicsAndHandicraftTypeSample.jpg) | 140.76 KB |\n\n",
