  "content": "Would like to get some professional opinions on Cufón. Specifically, I'm wondering if you see it in a similar light as WOFF. IE: It is a web-only format and can't be installed on a desktop machine. I'm starting to see some designers offering Cufón support in their pro licenses.\n\nSo, would you equate the two to be similar? Can you see any downside to Cufón from an IP perspective?\n\nThe only downside I can see, is that 1) It is a text format and therefore easy to edit out domain links. 2) It is easily downloaded and installed on your own website. But it is impossible (from what I can tell) to turn back into an OTF. I can already turn a WOFF back into an OTF.\n\nWhy or why don't you support Cufón?\n\n",

You are technically giving the font to someone else to do this, which has IP significance.\n\nOf course (and not IP related), WOFF (or EOT or raw web fonts) is much better for accessibility and text selection.\n\nAnd it all comes down to whether the foundry from which the font came allows either Cufón embedding or WOFF. One or the other will not be useful at all if it's not allowed for the font you want to use.\n\n"

It does not and never will require any type designer to \"steer \" their \"font production resources to one thing or another\".  \nAt worst, that's a lie, at best, misleading.  \nAnd outside of Firefox - whose own Jonathan Kew was one of the co-creators of WOFF - there is, as yet, no indication that WOFF will be the standard transport wrapper for sfnt fonts in the future. Tell me, Stephen, in what ways is the result to be had from WOFF superior to that of EOT? Tell me, please.  \nAn email and blog post campaign expressing \"support\" for WOFF was launched as a stall tactic to provide some kind of plausible and defensible cover for delaying licensing for web use outside of hosted services. That's where we're at.  \nThis has been made quite clear on this very forum.  \nI'm just calling it the way it is, Stephen.  \nI don't want \\*you\\* pissing on my leg and telling me it's raining, either.  \nCut the crap, I'm tired of hearing it. (And I say this with the greatest respect.)\n\nThere is now cross-browser support for @font-face in all the major browsers today using TTF, OTF, and EOT.  \nIf you don't want to play on the web, just say so. It's OK. But people aren't idiots, and as soon as they get around to checking out the facts they will know something is amiss. What you say just doesn't add up and people will figure out what's up.\n\nSorry for going OT but enough is enough.\n\nRich\n\n"

That's like saying there was cross-platform font support c.1989 with Windows Type 1 PS fonts and Mac Type 1 PS fonts, despite the fact that these were actually entirely different, incompatible file structures. Serving different formats to different browsers is not what I call cross-browser support; it's multi-browser support, sure, but not cross-browser support.\n\nStop dumping on the font makers, Rich. If the non-IE browsers gave any indication at all of supporting an EOT-compatible format, font makers would follow that lead. As it is, those browser makers have made it very clear that they are not interested in CWT, whereas Microsoft are making it pretty clear that they are interested in WOFF.\n\nYou might legitimately berate font makers for lacking your sense of urgency about any of this, but perhaps if the web without web fonts were somehow not working it would be easier to get excited about what promises to be a lot of bad typography. Pass me a Verdana.\n\n"

It gives foundries a legal foundation to prevent or prosecute abuse. The source of the \"excitement\" about it is likely that it is the best chance of having an interoperable font format to use with @font-face.\n\n(Yes, WOFF is not a \"format\", but that word is a reasonable stand-in for most people.)\n\n"

But there are counter-indications. Ralf Herrmann has done some looking into this and has reported that no other major browser maker is currently considering WOFF support.  \nIf you think there is some urgency on the part of browser makers who already support TTF/OTF and in some cases SVG - why would there be? Do you think WOFF will be supported in IE9? If it isn't, that pushes ubiquitous WOFF support ten years down the road.  \nIf the current draft charter is adopted, now, that would be a strong indication - a done deal, really, and ultimately all browsers would end up supporting it. But when? And how long will it take those browsers to propagate? It will take the working group a year just to make the recommendation.  \nBut all of this is irrelevant. So what?  \nWhat will have changed that would matter to me or any web developer today or for the foreseeable future?\n\n_Stop dumping on the font makers, Rich._  \nIf that's how you wish to paint me, that's your call. If you truly see me that way, I guess I'll have to live with it. Have I ever \"dumped\" on you? Or Christopher? Or Thomas Phinney? Or many, many others that I have crossed swords with here? Nothing I've ever said or done rates that statement. These are highly emotional times, and if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.  \nBut I'm tired of being lied to, and I'm tired of staying silent. Coles has to be lying because he can't be so stupid as to actually believe what he is saying. It's like saying toy manufacturers should gear their Christmas production to the kind of wrapping paper people will be using. It's preposterous. It's a talking point, pure and simple. Sorry.  \n(I do understand your intense empathy, though. It's an admirable quality, but in this case I feel it's misplaced. If Coles can't defend his own position maybe he should just keep quiet.)  \nIf my tone seems to you out of line, sorry, but I'm tired of this BS about WOFF being a pivotal, critical, enabling technology that simply must be in place before things can proceed further.  \nExcept in Firefox 3.6, it enables nothing but sloth, delay and, it would seem, misrepresentation.  \nIf you or anybody else doesn't want to sell fonts for use on the web, for the umpteenth time: it's perfectly OK with me. I do not mind one single bit. Your fonts, your choice.\n\n@christopher\n\n_As John said, the Fonts Working Group charter is a strong indication that WOFF is a fait accompli._  \nIt isn't approved yet. But again, so what? Converting an TTF or an OTF is still a simple after-step. It's basically a zip file, for heavens sake. A smart zip file geared towards font data but the same is true for EOT and we already have that in 60%+ of all the browsers out there.\n\ngotta go - but since the topic of Cufon has been totally ripped to shreds I'll come back and clarify \"cross-browser\".\n\n"

What I hear people saying -- what I've also said myself -- is that WOFF seems to offer the best possibility of true cross-browser compatibility, based on what the browser makers are saying and doing. In other words, its the format we can reasonably expect to be supported in most if not all future browsers, and that's the kind of cross-browser compatibility we want. Perhaps this seems strange to you, but you didn't develop fonts through the pre-OpenType period when every format and platform required different binaries, a situation I think many font makers would like to avoid in web fonts. Sure, the actual making of different wrappers deliverables is relatively simple, but multiple delivery formats means multiple customer support scenarios. This is not to say that we won't suck it up in the short-term, making both WOFF and EOT-compatible fonts as customers request (which is, of course, exactly what FontShop are doing, so I'm not sure why you're beating up on Stewf). The point about WOFF is that it gives both font makers and browser makers a common goal to steer towards, and that is a Good Thing, much to be preferred to everyone running in different directions for years to come.\n\n"

Fink just doesn't have it right, poor fellow.  \nLook, let's skip it because over the next eight weeks exactly what level of interoperability exists and what font designers need to provide to support @font-face cross-browser, as the implementations exists will be crystal clear.\n\n_Is anyone saying that WOFF must be in place before things can proceed further?_\n\nNo, what's been said by some is that WOFF \\*must\\* be in place before \\*they\\* will proceed further. Yes they are. And what WOFF actually is, is being misrepresented.\n\nThe history:  \nWOFF came about because the retail font industry put up a stink about raw TTF/OTF files, turned to EOT, talks fell through on EOT. A wrapper similar in effect to EOT was designed that ultimately was named WOFF. The Firefox guys turned their back on EOT, and decided to implement WOFF as an alternative. We can consult the complete W3C fonts mailing list to see if that's an accurate summation. I believe it is.  \nWOFF had nothing to do with cross-browser compatibility.\n\nWe already have that:\n\n@font-face{  \nfont-family:'somefont';  \nsrc: url(somefont.eot);  \nsrc: url(somefont.eot);url(somefont.ttf);  \n}\n\nWill deliver exactly the same font to Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE 6, 7, 8 and, if the CSS3 spec is any guide, IE9 as well. You may not want to believe it, but it's so.  \nIf OTFs remain problematical for the foreseeable future, that's just a fact. If type designers want to ignore it. OK by me. But it's the way it is and it has nothing to do with WOFF. It has to do with Windows and Internet Explorer.\n\nRE: Providing EOT and WOFF files:  \n_(which is, of course, exactly what FontShop are doing, so I'm not sure why you're beating up on Stewf)._\n\nResponded to you on this here:http://typophile.com/node/66933?page=1#comment-401176\n\nLastly, and keeping with this, I think it's Stephen Coles turn to explain what he meant by:  \n_If I was a type maker planning for the future I would steer my font production resources to a format that is bound to be the standard of the future. That format is WOFF._  \nWhat \\*did\\* you mean, Stephen?\n\nRegards,\n\nRich\n\n"

      "content": "Rich, your potted history is mostly correct. The part I take issue with is the characterisation that the ‘retail font industry’ first ‘turned to EOT’ before ‘talks fell through’ on that format. It would be easy to come to that view based on the W3C list discussion, but of course that wasn't the only discussion taking place at the time. The number of font vendors actively supporting an EOT-compatible solution was fairly small, and the .webfont spec development that became WOFF long preceded the evident failure of ‘EOT-Lite’ to gain traction. Indeed, one could say that by providing a broadly acceptable alternative to EOT-Lite, the introduction of .webfont/WOFF provided the means by which the non-IE browsers, especially FireFox, could easily resist pressure to implement an EOT-compatible solution. As you know, I was one of the relatively few font makers vocally supporting an EOT-compatible option, and I don't think it is the case that ‘talks fell through on EOT’ but that the talks came to [a different result than the one you wanted](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013133327/http:/lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2010JanMar/0032.html).\n\n_.... Will deliver exactly the same font to Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE 6, 7, 8 and, if the CSS3 spec is any guide, IE9 as well. You may not want to believe it, but it's so._\n\nI've never denied that it is so. Yes, if you serve two different files to different browsers, one of which is a naked desktop font, then you can get the same typeface displayed on all those different browsers. And two different files is better than, say, five different files, but since one of those files is something that most commercial font vendors are not licensing for web serving and are not going to license for web serving, this hardly seems to me like a solution. If you want, you can make the case that serving multiple file types constitutes some kind of cross-browser compatibility -- and I could even accept that case with the caveat that it isn't _ideal_ cross-browser compatibility --, but if web font licenses won't permit one half of that compatibility then it's de facto incompatible.\n\nSo let's leave IE and EOT aside for a moment. As you do not tire of pointing out -- and nor should you --, this is something that already works and will continue to work. WOFF is what is needed on the non-IE browsers (which thankfully have faster and more widespread upgrade cycles than IE). WOFF is where the browser makers who refuse to support EOT and the font makers who refuse to license naked desktop fonts for the web can come together.\n\n"

Even if support for WOFF were universal, I have absolutely no reason to believe they would be made available on terms that I could or would accept. The divides are very great.
