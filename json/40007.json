They downloaded it from one of the \"free font\" websites., such as this one here:  \n [http://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=Angelina](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718064940/http:/www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=Angelina \"http://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=Angelina\")  \nThe license and designer info in the font does not contain any information about who designed it or to what conditions it my be used or licensed. Can anyone here tell who is the designer of this font?\n\nRegards,\n\nAlbert-Jan Pool\n\n",

There are many great handwriting fonts these days.\n\nIn my searching I came across this conversation on the very same topic  \n [http://ask.metafilter.com/52509/IS-Angelinattf-really-a-freeware-font](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718064940/http:/ask.metafilter.com/52509/IS-Angelinattf-really-a-freeware-font \"http://ask.metafilter.com/52509/IS-Angelinattf-really-a-freeware-font\")\n\nIf we believe what is written then this font is really named Angie and was used exclusively for a greeting card company -- and you know, there is no reason to doubt that - happens all the time.\n\n"
