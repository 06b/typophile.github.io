  "content": "Pitching this little sucker to a homeless shelter manager next week.\n\nThe building is new and very modern. Opening in March and causing a lot of controversy in the city. The person briefing us is very open to a different outlook on shelter branding. The shelter is more of a schooling/get back on your feet/change your life centre. I've stayed well away from the roofs/doorways/hearts used in pretty much all other shelter branding. The logo is aimed more at council members, business' and press than the actual homeless.\n\nThe building is split into 5 coloured sections which have been used in the kada font. The idea behind the actual logo is the spark and energy of inspiration and change that the people can make for themselves. Also changing the fabric of our lives could be used (Afterthought?!). The 'LIGHT\" in variable worked better un-aligned due to the round edge of kada.\n\nThis is the first time I have posted any work on here so all comments/abuse would be great...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023141313im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ARC_4846.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "OMG TOO MUCH COLOR AND DETAIL THAT WILL NEVER WORK IN BLACK AND WHITE AND SMALL SIZES AND...oh...wait...hey, it looks pretty good small and black and white! Nice.\n\nAt first it seems a bit too trendy, but after considering it, it's fresh and I'd say unique...especially given the context of both the entity that will be using it an the architecture.\n\nWhen you're given the benefit of having great architecture, that, itself, really becomes the predominant brand element, so I think your approach makes perfect sense...embrace the architecture.\n\nI like the type and that it's a mask. Perhaps this colored lines are the primary imagery, but the logo seems well suited for some flexibility by being able to swap out different images to mask as the need arises.\n\nThe type is solid too...you might get away with not having to use the lined background in the small sizes.\n\n"

I produced the lines using a spirograph effect and think I could get some really nice funky crops for certain parts of the building interior.\n\nThanks again!!\n\n"

Maybe move the pattern a bit to the right? I'm shure you allready tried that ...  \nUnusual logo in a very positive way, nice work!\n\n"
