In fact, during the late eighties, René Kerfante (Monotype Managing Director of the Typography Division) mentioned to me that in his opinion, CG’s first release of Schneidler was one of the better versions.\n\nThis is only mentioned here in passing as an historic reference to “CG” and not intended to open any discussion regarding clones, revivals and historic type pirating. Let’s leave that stuff for another thread and time. :-)\n\n"
