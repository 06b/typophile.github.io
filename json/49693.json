      "content": "I love the symbols. I think your S is quite nice; the fact that it is not fully as big and wide as the other caps is not as much of a problem as you imagine.\n\nAs for the numerals, for practical use there should probably be more choices. Make a wide set in the LFs and a narrow set in the OSFs (an open-topped rectilinear 4 in the narrow set would be cool), and then users could mix and match them at their own discretion.\n\n"

      "content": "I like it as it is, even though about the figures I think 3 should be the same width as 5; also would be best to \"spice\" the alphabet with some additional alternates to choose from. Regarding the capital S, looks OK to me. Though I would love seeing an alternate Q with more distinctive tail.\n\nPosting a PDF is not a requirement, but sometimes it helps to see the design up close, in more detail. But some people prefer rounding off the design first...\n\n"
