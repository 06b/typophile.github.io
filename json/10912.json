  "content": "Numerica was inspired by Herbert Bayer, , Paul Renner, and JanTschichold and the Bauhaus deconstruction-simplification movement. I thought ..what if these designers had been doing type in the 1960's and not 1920's. Add to that the element of numerical forms. And I would guess you would end up with Numerica.   \nI used this for Design Alchemy collateral until Dec. 2001.   \n ![Numerica.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153721im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/849.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Numerical influence aside, i really like some of the forms. the second s is really great. It seems like most type designs play with the veneer of letterforms, but don't challenge the basic form. i don't typically care for faces that use numerical elements to mimic letters, it's a trick that's been done before, but i think that you have taken it one step further here. there are a few really unique shapes. i also dig the f and the second a.   \n   \ncr\n\n"
