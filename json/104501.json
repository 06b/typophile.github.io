The headline sample is perhaps be stretched for effect. There is also the less ambitious Scotch Roman MT from Adobe and Monotype Imaging.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "Actually, both font and the context in which it is used -- a \"technical article\" -- suggests this is the original [Computer Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820061217/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern), the default font for TeX created by Donald E. Knuth.\n\nOne of the tell-tale signs would be the proportions are ever so slightly different for different sizes. In its native habitat, CM fonts are scaled and spaced according to its intended output size. The image is not large enough to accurately measure it, but I'd eyeball that the large bold title is more flattened than the body copy.\n\nThese are not regular fonts; there are no exact counterparts in TTF or OTF format, because the scaling is done on the fly. Even OpenType features cannot do that (yet?). So best you can hope for is a precalculated font for 8pt, another for 10pt, and yet another for 12pt. (And so on.) If you do, beware the odd character mapping you will find in fast rip-offs. TeX has one of the weirdest native character maps _ever_. For example, it has no \"space\" glyph -- just because you don't ever need one inside TeX.\n\n"
