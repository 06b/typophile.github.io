The site was very active for many years until a dry spell in 2005-06 when software issues and time constraints limited new content. In July 2007, Typographica marked a reawakening with its annual [review of the year's new fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20120429235503/http:/typographica.org/001103.php).\n\nTypographica is edited by [Stephen Coles](http://web.archive.org/web/20120429235503/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Stephen%20Coles) and [Joshua Lurie-Terrell](http://web.archive.org/web/20120429235503/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Joshua%20Lurie-Terrell).
