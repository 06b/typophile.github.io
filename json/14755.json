I looked at all the garamonds, Flareserif (sort of like elan), even other FB faces like Bodega. It's just lacking the sophistication I require...I want it to look very modern (of course i'm using a 30's font like Agency, right?) Very legible and streamlined. I also want to stray away for the obvious picks. And NO copperplate... Any suggestions?\n\n",
