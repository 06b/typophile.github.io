I'm not seeing a Golden Section formatting, but you are right about the positioning of the text block relative to the page. The oblique axis going from the bottom of the inner edge to the outside top intersects the top outer corner and bottom inner corner of the text block.\n\nThe text block is 39 ciceros wide and 54 cic 9 deep.  \nThe column widths are 9 ciceros wide, the horizontal space between the columns is 12 didot points;  \nThe vertical cells are 5 cic 9; the vertical spacing between the cells is 15 didot points.\n\nThat’s the system. But is it the logic?\n\nIt could be that the vertical arithmetic is premised on the depth given by the diagnol for a 39 ciceros wide block.\n\n"
