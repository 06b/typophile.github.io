I am attaching a simple PDF for your collective consideration.\n\nThanks  \nJ.\n\n[http://www.alfa60.com/joe](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714014526/http:/www.alfa60.com/joe)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [REVIEW.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714014526/http:/typophile.com/files/REVIEW.pdf) | 55.27 KB |\n| [Untitled-1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714014526/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_43.jpg) | 10.97 KB |\n| [txt.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714014526/http:/typophile.com/files/alberto3.pdf) | 116.12 KB |\n\n",
