When you install these fonts they appear under one menu name, e.g., Caslon, and the family members appear on a sub menu in InDesign, or in the case of Mac OS X TextEdit, the Font Panel groups them under one family and lists the various faces in the TypeFace column.   \n   \nHow do you name a set of fonts to get this to happen?   \n   \nFor example, assuming:   \n   \nBulmerGoldfinch-Roman   \nBulmerGoldfinch-Italic   \nBulmerGoldfinch-Titling   \nBulmerGoldfinch-Ornaments   \n   \nWhat values are the same in each font and what values are different?\n\n",
