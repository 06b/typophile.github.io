But I do do hinting  \nas needed, or as paid. :-) Heck I’d even shoot you if you paid me to.\\*  \nWell, no, but you know what I mean.\n\n\\* Who hasn’t seen the amazing movie “White”? Go rent it.\n\n\\> over your quota.\n\nActually that’s a feature not a bug. :-)  \nMy TMF mailbox is indeed full, full of 10 tons of sludge (spam), which however I don’t have the heart to just delete en masses, being a firm believer in the Happy Accident. The good news is that although the mail doesn’t get stored over there it does get forwarded to my “real” email address (where Gmail does an incredible job filtering the sludge). Plus the sender is automatically notified to look harder for a better email for me, so it’s really the best of both worlds! :-)\n\nAnyway, I will reply to your (nicely surprising) email ASAP.\n\nhhp\n\n"
