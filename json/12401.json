      "content": "Paul,\n\nThat’s a very good question indeed! :)\n\nWhat you’re trying to achieve is legitimate. Unfortunately, this is where the Adobe FEA syntax shows its weakness. In the OpenType binary tables, lookups are completely separated from features and are only mapped to features. Therefore, in the binary tables, you can easily intersperse lookups that map to different features.\n\nThe Adobe FEA syntax attempts to make things simpler for the user, so in this syntax the lookups are defined inside of the feature definitions. But this actually makes interspersing of lookups very difficult to achieve.\n\nOne possible, although not very elegant solution is to define all your named lookups in a separate, “fake” feature (called “xx01” for example) that would be placed at the beginning of the feature definitions. The order of the lookups in this lookup definition should reflect your desired order of the lookups in the final font. Then, in the clig and calt features, simply refer to the features by calling their names — in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, use VOLT to build your lookups and features, or build your font and do some post-processing of the binary tables in TTX.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "John,\n\nI don’t see it that way. The Adobe FDK syntax is wonderful for automated, repeatitive, or systematic feature definitions. Combined with Python scripting, it’s possible to achieve a high degree of automation \\*and\\* complexity. For example, many parts of my Zapfino code was half-generated using dictionary-driven Python scripts. In VOLT, I would have drowned in the amount of point-and-clicks. VOLT, on the other hand, is much more suitable for individualized, highly custom projects with little repetition.\n\nIdeally, it would be nice to have a tool that can both :)\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "can i do the majority of my feature programming in FontLab and then tweak it using VOLT? Or would I have to do it all in VOLT???\n\nalso, let me try to restate what you said about the “fake” feature to see if i’m understanding correctly: make a “fake” feature (ie xx01) to house all my contextual lookups in the order that i want them to be called. Make sure this is the first feature called. Then create a “clig” and a “calt” feature which are basically empty, listing them (in my case) with the clig first, since the first set of lookups in xx01 would be clig features, thus making calt follow the clig feature in the lookups.\n\nAnyway, that’s what i got out of what you had written, Adam. I hope I’m understanding you correctly. Please clarify if i am not.\n\nbut regarding one of my earlier questions… why is there a separate clig feature instead of just one calt feature??? that would make all of this easier to do to begin with.\n\n"

      "content": "I use VOLT simply because the Adobe FDK can’t do two things that I seem to need to do in almost every project: one-to-many substitutions and GPOS anchor positioning. That said, I tend to do a lot of my OTL work outside of VOLT in spreadsheets and VOLT source text files. The latter are certainly more complicated that the FDK syntax, but I’ve got used to editing them, and can work pretty quickly in this way.\n\nPaul, FontLab has a function that allows you to export OTL features as a VOLT project, but I have not tried this since any early version that didn’t work. It shouldn’t be too difficult to get right, though, and perhaps it has improved. I’ll be meeting Adam in a couple of weeks, and I suspect FL-\\>VOLT workflows is one of the things we’ll discuss.\n\n"
