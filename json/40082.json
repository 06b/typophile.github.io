However, it depends on whether or not you are only interested in the design aspect or the company as a whole. I find that Creative Directors are often still men, there tends to be more women Associate Creative Directors, near split in Art Directors and slightly more men in Senior Designer roles. But, beyond design there are predominantly more women in other roles - account managers, traffic managers, HR, etc.\n\n"

Very few seem to make it through the glass ceiling to get to the Creative Director or even Art Director level (I really don’t know how to call all these jobs, they seem to changing every year!). Those who make it, are often given feminine accounts, such as cosmetics, clothing, maybe travel. Mind you, I used to work with a female art director for a petrol station chain, but even that was more about gardening tools and chocolate than petrol. There seems to be more female copywriters than art directors.  \nAll this is just my gut feeling, no science about it. Ambitious young men get hired and promoted, when young women don’t. I suppose the main reason is, that the young man is unlikely to go on maternity leave (here in Finland you can be absent up to about four years and still expect to have a job waiting for you).\n\n"

Most agencies have a general info email, and they probably won’t answer your question because of the trouble you can get in when dealing with gender issues in advertising. Especially if it’s a man doing the answering. Research what happened to Neil French. And another reason you probably aren’t getting answers is because the general info lines usually go to someone who doesn’t work in the creative department.\n\nPhoning is a much better way to get a hold of creative people. If you want I can give you some names of prominent female creative directors who would be willing to maybe answer your questions about women in advertising.\n\n"

One of the things I like about publishing is that it is NOT youth-quake oriented, and in fact age and experience are appreciated and respected. I was made Art Director at 30 but that was considered very young, and they let me know they felt they were taking a gamble on me cuz of my age (luckily it worked out). Five years later I lost an AD position at another publisher because I was too young. You find designers and editors of all ages working in publishing.\n\n"
