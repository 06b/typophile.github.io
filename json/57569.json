  "content": "I know the Jack Daniels label has been done to death on here but the poster adverts have quite a nice antique-looking body text on, which I can't ID.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108223307im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jdposter_5949.png)\n\nSorry the size is so small. I've looked at LTC Kennerley as I heard JD uses that elsewhere in their design but the A doesn't match: serif on the top of the A in the poster but not in Kennerley. Also the serifs look bigger in Kennerley in general.\n\nOther features which stick out are the diagonal bar of the e, a straight tail on the y and the 3 terminal W.\n\n",

The Lanston version sold by P22/LTC, called [LTC Italian Oldstyle](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108223307/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-italian-old-style/) seems very close, unlike the Monotype version of this typeface (W wrong for starters). Judith Sutcliffe did one called Italian Electric, based on this Goudy typeface, and hers is also a better match than the Monotype version. Richard Beatty has also done some Goudy revivals, and he may have done this one too.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I took a better picture of one of the other posters yesterday:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108223307im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jdposter2_3816.jpg)\n\nThe c terminal is more rounded in the Goudy face, which seems to match the poster better. Those two faces are very similar though ... Maybe the Goudy is a slightly more consistent colour in blocks of text.\n\n"
