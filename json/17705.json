I wonder if Adobe says “we want these features for CS3, until when can they be ready?” or if they say “it needs to be realeased in November 2006, let’s have a look what features we can implement until then”.  \nFor the customer, second one would be better, as it is feature focused, not time focused. Looking at CS2, which is quite good already, there is no need for hurrying to version CS3, except for marketing reasons.\n\n"
