We found out Sütterlin-Schrift is a handwriting style rather than the name of the typeface.\n\nDoes anyone know what the name of the typeface is? Has it ever been digitalised? Is there a similar font in existence?\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n",

In trying to teach children what, exactly, a letter looks like we're in effect attempting to reduce it to its platonic essence as a great, didactic project of modernism. It's a handwriting-based approach that's quite the opposite of the chirographic one: instead of trying to fill type with the ductus of a professional lettering artist, it's trying to instil perfect regularity in the most childlike of simple writing styles.\n\nOften it can be naive and clumsy, granted, but the best stuff is brilliant. For instance: The [\"SÖ-style\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218042937/http:/4.bp.blogspot.com/-E8ckEeMgiOU/UJpGarpLiYI/AAAAAAAAFRg/Rioer39LlmY/s400/3401114503_457fdb835c.jpg) of semi-connected script taught in Sweden for about a decade in the 70s (as designed by lettering artist Kerstin Anckers) is marvellously legible.\n\n"

Was it because of a wish to purge cursive writing from the teaching model? New focus on keyboarding?  \nDon\n\n"
