  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am starting an R&D company - advanced theoretical analysis of stuff, mostly math/computer science/physics/biotech. I'm not here to boast though, I've been working with several of my friends, full-time designers on the company's typography, as I am an amateur typophile.\n\nAll the proposal's that my friends came up with, were sans-serifs, stuff like you can see Nokia, Google, etc. do.\n\nMy question for you is - do you think sans-serif font is the only possible option to express the ideas of doing research, the lightness of knowledge etc? Can one design a typographical identity of a research company based on a serif font? It seems to be a trend - everywhere in Poland universities are redesigning their logos abandoning old serif typefaces to sans-serif's.\n\nCan one find a serif font that would embody the modernity, innovative and light feeling of research, without looking old-fashioned and depreciated? What do you think?\n\n",

      "content": "Google uses a serif (although I guess they use a sans-serif as their secondary typeface for all of their various web apps).\n\nI think one of the reasons we tend to associate serifs (as a genre, which is problematic, but I will get to that) with stuffiness is that most of the serifs that are included with our OSes and bundled with Adobe CS are very much based on more classical letterforms, and are more apt for setting text rather than display work. This is fine; if you're going to have typefaces bundled with your software you want them to be workhorses.\n\nBut check out FontShop's Type Trends 2010 page: [http://www.fontshop.com/blog/?cat=76](http://web.archive.org/web/20100511215103/http:/www.fontshop.com/blog/?cat=76 \"http://www.fontshop.com/blog/?cat=76\") . Notice how the serifs are chunkier and more apt for the kind of display work you're looking at. They don't seem stuffy at all. I think if you look at some of the more recent serifs, you may find what you are looking for.\n\nEDIT: I guess what I'm really saying is that slab serifs are what you're looking for. But not stuff like Rockwell or Clarendon — you want the more humanist forms of recently-released slabs.\n\n"
