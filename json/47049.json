  "content": "Hello,\n\nThe last web edition of Before & After had a nice layout using Bureau Grot Extra Compressed Black, a font that would work well with a current project. However, the going rate (5 fonts for $175) is a bit beyond my reach, and I can’t pass the cost along because the piece is pro bono. Is there a cheaper alternative for either the specified font or a viable alternative?\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ adelto.co.uk logo (nearly finished)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907014803/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47058 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Push Pin Studio Typography ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907014803/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47067 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

So at 35 styles the per font cost goes down to $35 (thus the $175 rate quoted above), and 6 or more styles drop to $30 per. Further discounts above 16 styles.\n\nThese are the single workstation rates, and styles may be mixed across families.\n\n(More info at [http://www.fontbureau.com/help/quickpricingchart](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907014803/http:/www.fontbureau.com/help/quickpricingchart \"http://www.fontbureau.com/help/quickpricingchart\"))\n\n— K.\n\n"
