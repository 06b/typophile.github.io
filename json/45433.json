How old is ’vintage’ in this case?\n\nIt looks like late 19th century to me, and the lower case resembles DeVinne No. 11 shown in Jaspert, but the M and R don’t fit that at all.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I hate being stumped.\n\nI really appreciate your efforts and maybe the answer is yet to come.\n\nThank you for helping!\n\n"
