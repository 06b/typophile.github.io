I've gone through the Bowfin Printworks list and can't find it, so I'm turning to the experts!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829225932im_/http:/typophile.com/files/script%20font%20ID_3747.jpg)\n\n",

The rest of the word Invited looks like [Ventura](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829225932/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=TTT0000051#flont), with an alternate connecting 'v' that shows up in the character map.\n\nI can't see the rest of the script very well. Maybe a better view would help.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Maybe it is two fonts, I hadn't considered that possibility.\n\nPS, Mr Yanega, I just wanted to say that I'm a total fangirl of your script font list. Thank you for compiling it!\n\n"

Champion Script is based on the same script that Francoise Boltana used for his font of the same name. I have to say that this \"Copper\" family really does look to me like a hybrid of styles, rather than a unified script style.\n\nTrish, thanks for your comment, and for showing me a new Script font for the Guide. If you have this font, and would be willing to make samples for the Guide, I would be very grateful.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
