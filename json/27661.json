  "content": "Hello all,  \nI work for a newspaper publishing company.  \nMy team is having a rough time getting new fonts imported into an old PC-based desktop publishing pagination system, Good News (GN3) built by Tera. The Tera people are working on the issue but haven’t found a solution. I’ve been told the fonts need to run through Fontographer before they work but our IT Director can’t get them to display on screen or print. The fonts are the Mercury family from Hoefler & Frere-Jones. H&FJ say the fonts have worked for others with similar systems. We can get their Whitney font to work just fine.\n\nAny insight into this or similar problems with using fonts in pagination systems would be great. I love this font and would hate to see us miss the opportunity to use it.\n\nThanks,  \n-Kris\n\n [‹ Adobe Acrobat Pro 7.0 Font problems - HELP!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060059/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21264 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Loss of characters in Font Reserve Browser & PopChar Pro ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060059/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27565 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
