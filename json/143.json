How does one insert Greek characters (Ohm sign, Delta, and so on) of the font (Hoeflet Toman Alt) into a PageMaker 6.5 Plus document?   \n The Windows 2000 character map utility shows the code (U + 2126 for Ohm, U + 2206 for Delta and so on) but how do I insert these characters in the document? Presumably, these are Unicode numbers.   \n Will be grateful for some help in the matter.   \n Yateen \\< [yateen@teri.res.in](mailto:yateen@teri.res.in)\\>\n\n",

That's why Jonathan created the Alternate font, in order to provide easy access to these characters.   \n   \nIn the Mac Postscript font, the Omega is in the option-z position and the delta is in the option-j position. I don't know if this is true in the Windows version of the font.   \n   \nIf this doesn't help, then contact the Hoefler Type Foundry at [info@typography.com](mailto:info@typography.com).   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"
