I can’t find this font anywhere and feel like I’m going nuts!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406024853im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font_6427.jpg)\n\nThis font is usually used in all kind of monitoring LCD panels and in particular in this one:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406024853im_/http:/typophile.com/files/adl-backlit_4544.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406024853im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MoTeC%20SDL%20Boost%20blk_4559.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406024853im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SDL_6056.jpg)\n\nBy the way, in the electronic _[PDF manual](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406024853/http:/www.motec.com/support/manuals/Manual%20ADL2%20A5.pdf)_ from that LCD panel there are _[illustrations of its front side](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406024853/http:/img165.imageshack.us/img165/6694/manualhd7.jpg)_ and in document properties of the manual is specified, that it has been created in Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows). From this I can draw a conclusion that the given font exists (I **very** much hope), and has been used during creation of that PDF manual. There are many similar fonts and I have them, but replacement is unacceptable. This part:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406024853im_/http:/typophile.com/files/x_3710.jpg)\n\nshould be by all means displaced to the left. I.e. it would be very desirable full similarity to the original!\n\nGuys, I really need it. Please, help me!\n\n",
