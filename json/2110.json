Changing the angle of the inner slopes of the M to match an inverted A shape might help bring the detail together.   \n   \nNice start.\n\n"

Have you tried playing with the   \nserifs, because they all look cut and pasted, a spot   \nof variation wouldn't go amiss my good man.   \n   \nWhat did you think of the vega party? pretty good huh!   \nsigh. no longer a student, just an unemployed designer!\n\n"

Could the serif coming out of the 'G' (top) be a little more convex, alluding to the larger convex shapes you now have? I also like the 'R', but would hope for an alternate version that isn't quite as swashy. And the sharp points might be better to have the a tiny flats. NIce!!\n\n"
