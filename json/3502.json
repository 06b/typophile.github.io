  "content": "The font shop at [http://www.kennmunk.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020090247/http:/www.kennmunk.com/) is now open.   \nAt the moment you can buy his fonts Acetone and Contamination (dingbat system) for PC and Mac and the 9 pixel Linemap for Mac, but more, mainly experimental, fonts will come. Next up is Linemap for the PC and 'Arkudius' which is loosely based on sanskrit and segments of circles.   \nFree fonts and dingbats are still available for download.   \nThere is still the problem of making digital coffee, as the shop is of the kind that has comfy chairs for the customers.\n\n",
