The sample may have deteriorated the stroke width, or this may be an instance of the older [Multiple Master](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041816/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Multiple%252BMaster) version of the font.\n\n"

Obviously the kerning needs to be matched and the quality of your scan makes the actual weight of the font difficult to work out. But this is definitely Penumbra Sans.\n\n"
