  "content": "Hi Colleagues,\n\nI need a help to find the source of a font. I will be very grateful with yours wisdom, helping me to find the source of this font. The font is part of my graduate academic thesis, where I write about font revival and need, as part of the thesis, create my own revival.\n\nThe font is attached. I am working since many years in this revival and, unfortunatelly, the original source is actually lost and I cant  \nremember where it comes from. Maybe the original name is signet, but I am not sure.\n\nI need a help to fill the blanks. Is it possible?\n\nChyrllene K,  \nIntellecta Design\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130416001328im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Image_4117.jpg)\n\n",
