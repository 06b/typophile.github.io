  "content": "Here is the front cover (left) and an insert (right) for the first draft of my wedding invitation. Just looking for some feedback. It’s certainly a challenge finding the right pair to go with Ministry Script. Any feedback would be appreciated. The paper will be brown and we will most likely have the type foil stamped in a light blue (brown too dark for letterpress).\n\nThe wedding will not be overly formal and will be in Vail, Colorado. Outdoors.. think nature, aspen trees, pine trees, rocky mountains, mountain creek, etc.\n\nI’m curious why some of the characters don’t seem to align/connect with each other with 0 tracking?\n\nThe verbage isn’t dialed in yet nor is the upper/lowercase, etc. Also looking at ampersand options for the cover. Again, just showing an initial draft for feedback.\n\nMinistry Script, Bodoni Twelve EF, Frutiger Black Condensed\n\nThank you!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042341im_/http:/typophile.com/files/inviteshow1_6138.jpg)\n\n [‹ Pairing a sans serif with Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042341/http:/typophile.com/node/43349 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Advice needed - Nazi typography dissertation research ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042341/http:/typophile.com/node/36966 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "It’s a very nice invitation. Feedback:\n\n1. I don’t think you need both a sans and a serif font to pair with Ministry. Just use the Serif.\n\n2. on the front I’d put the location and date in the serif font. Just leave your names in Ministry. Ministry doesn’t read easily at such a small size and the cover will look more balanced.\n\n3. The serif type on the back looks just a little tight - maybe open the leading a point? I’m not sure you need “Wedding Ceremony” either. If you remove that you can open up the rest of the type.\n\n4. Don’t you need “to” in between the names on the back?\n\n"

      "content": "I like this “as is”. Everything looks great. But, I think you should consider moving the address down to align with the line base “Wedding Ceremony”, basically being on top of it. Maybe “Wedding Ceremony” shouldn’t be so big. I would use only the Script and Bodoni 12.\n\nCheers\n\nAndre\n\n"

      "content": "Overall, I like it.\n\nI disagree with pattyfab regarding your use of serif and sans fonts apart from Ministry. On the front, I _do_ think the sans works better, but perhaps ever-so-slightly larger. I agree with pattyfab on point 2 though, the location and date are far too difficult to read at that size, try replacing with the sans font.\n\nOn the insert, I think the periods after Mr and Mrs look jarring, but maybe that’s just because I’ve been reading the _Economist_ lately... I don’t know if it’s okay to omit the period. I am American, and I know the convention here is to have the period after Mr and Mrs, but I think it would look better without. Maybe someone else will comment.\n\n"

      "content": "I like Bodoni with Ministry. Like some others here, I don’t see the need for Frutiger.\n\nMight it be possible to use some of the alternates in Ministry to vary the look of the names between the cover and the interior? I don’t have it, but I understand there are quite a few alternates and ligatures, and you might be able to get a more hand lettered look if you explore a bit. For example, the sample at Veer seems to show a “er” ligature, or at least a contextual alternate “e”, which you’re not using.\n\nI don’t understand why you set all the Bodoni in small caps... I think upper and lower case would be more readable and more pleasant, especially because I find the caps too big with the smallcaps. It might be just the screen shot, but the cap “M” in Mr. and Mrs. seem disproportionately large. If you do stay with the smallcaps, I’d at least use the UC ampersand in “Resort & Spa”. To my eye a small ampersand looks out of place in a mixed line like that.\n\n"
