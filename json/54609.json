Those of you who have already used the existing web-based version of WhatTheFont will be familiar with the general concept: upload an image of a font in use and WhatTheFont will identify which font it is.\n\nWith the iPhone version of WhatTheFont you can use the phone's built-in camera to photograph the text in question (or choose an existing image from your photo albums). The app allows you to crop the image, focusing on only the important parts before uploading. After confirming which characters are used in the image, the app provides a list of possible matching fonts. You can then either e-mail a link to a MyFonts page with more info on that font, or open it up in the iPhone's built-in Safari web browser.\n\nAnd best of all, the app is free!\n\nFor more info, check out MyFonts' official [WhatTheFont for iPhone page](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204121245/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/iPhone/), or just [download it from the iTunes Store](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204121245/http:/itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=304304134&mt=8).\n\nAlso keep an eye on the [MyFonts blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204121245/http:/blog.myfonts.com/) for future tips and upgrade info.\n\n",
