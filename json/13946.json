Can anyone confirm this (and maybe even give a year)?\n\n"

If you are interested, check P22 Art Deco (Carima Al Behairy, P22), GangueOuais (Darren Rigby, Starving 4 Entertainment) and Signum (a Grockified Broadway by Karl Nayeri, Prime Graphics).  \nThe Belgian company Alfac had a font called Spats but it was never digitized.\n\n"
