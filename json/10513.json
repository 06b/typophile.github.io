  "content": "Hello fellow type-lovers,   \n   \nA few months ago, I stumbled across your messageboard for the first time and have religiously lurked here since. It's a satisfying feeling to know that I'm not alone; to have proof that there are other like-minded individuals.   \n   \nI've finally a situation that begs for your expertise. As best I can, I've searched archives; my fear is that this topic has been covered, but I'll ask anyway. Any steadfast advice would be appreciated.   \n   \nI'm working on an annual report, laden with consecutive uppercase letters and numbers, which greatly interfere with a regular color and texture of the text that I'd like to maintain throughout.   \n   \nI'm working with Adobe Garamond.   \n   \nFollowing is just one sample paragraph:   \n   \nSCCVB actively pursued sales leads from companies and organizations such as Deloitte & Touche, Nortel, AMCAA, 2005 Workplace Summit, British Elle, Zeta Direct, 2005 NBC World Series, Retailers Choice, ROMBS Program, Whole House, Intel/American Express, BBC America, AH1 Meeting Services, Jamaican Tourist Board, Utopia, NVIDIA Product Launch, E4events Medical Professionals Conference, NPR, GQ and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The director of sales conducted presentations and sales meetings with BMG, NewLine Cinema, HBO, Tzell Travel, Sony, RCA and MTV.   \n   \nAs a teacher of typography, I encourage my students, when appropriate, to use oldstyle figures and small caps in text. This certainly appears to be an appropriate situation, but there are so many variables that there seems to be no correct answer.   \n   \n\"SSCVB\" is my client. When beginning a sentence (or paragraph), should the first \"S\" be a regular cap? It would look awkward to begin such a phrase with an x-height character. What if the second appearance of SSCVB falls mid-sentence?   \n   \n \"Nortel, AMCAA, 2005 Workplace,\"   \nIn a linear list, should AMCAA be all small caps or should the first letter, \"A,\" be a regular cap with the rest small? Clearly, 2005 would be set in oldstyle figures. Or would it?   \n   \n\"2005 NBC World Series\"   \n\"ROMBS Program\"   \n\"BBC America\"   \n\"AH1 Meeting Services\"   \n\"Utopia, NVIDIA Product\"   \n\"Launch, E4events Medical\"   \n\"Conference, NPR, GQ and Cystic\"   \n   \nYou get the picture?   \nI'm losing sleep.\n\n",

      "content": "I would not mind if SCCVB were all small caps even at the beginning   \nof a sentence. Start with a versal, and it wouldn't be an acrynom   \nany more. Same for AMCAA, ROMBS, &c.   \nBut you are right, most small caps are too small for all small caps.   \n   \nHave you tried a character style with all small caps aplied, and   \nenlarging type size a little? (Not too much, else small caps will   \nlook medium or bold.)   \n   \nKarsten\n\n"

      "content": "There's also a philsophical question here. Shouldn't text be set in the type it deserves? With the example paragraph, there is not much room for greatness. It seems to me fine just the way it is. Small caps and OSF will probably just make it more confusing to read. And suppose that every paragraph were like that? The designer would have to be getting a lot of money to make it worthwhile to try to spiff it up. In any case, in all design, function must come before aesthetics. Or rather, the aesthetics are dictated by the functional task. This seems to me the kind of text that should not be burdened with any aesthetic surprises. It's a great example of a common problem.\n\n"

      "content": "Clinton,   \n   \nI was just about to post the same question. I'm working on a Non-profit's newsletter that has the same issues as yours.   \n   \nIn my opinion, small caps have become more of an aesthetic thing than anything else. There may be some increase in legibility, but I think most people have become accustomed to seeing all caps for acronyms.   \n   \nIf youre completely unsure of what is correct, than you have two options. Set the type in what looks best to you, purely on aethetic (and possibly legibility) standards. Or you can leave it up to the client. Provide them with a couple of examples and let them decide. Obviously, you might get scary results from the second choice, but you will also get a pretty straightforward answer that the client will be happy with regardless.   \n   \nIn my own dilemma, I'm stuck between the all small caps and the opening regular cap/small cap rest of the acronym. I'm leaning toward the second, only because acronyms are obviously acronyms (becuase usually they make no sense) and that looks the most pleasing to me visually. I like calling it out with the regular cap because it is important enough to be capitalized, but I dont believe it is important enough to stick out like a sore thumb.\n\n"
