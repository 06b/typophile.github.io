Thanks mucho in advanced.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822211318im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KC-Masterpiece-Coupons_5841.jpg)\n\n",

Check for example the letter-forms and terminals for C, c and e in Euro Sans Cond Bold [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/euro-sans-pro/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822211318/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/euro-sans-pro/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/euro-sans-pro/\") There are also similar features with some serif fonts, such as the lobe on r Jakob Erbar's Candida, as suggested by Fivos. Also, Walbaum or Sirba [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/sirba/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822211318/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/sirba/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/sirba/\") for the top terminal on the s. The diamond dot on the i is a feature of some Fraktur designs.  \nDon \n"
