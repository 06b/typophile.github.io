There are the obvious reasons: Garamond is everywhere, and it wasn't designed to be carved. Beyond that, I'd like to hear what you have to say. Hopefully you can have a bit of pity on me, I've probably done a whole 5–10 hours of lettering in stone, and don't know that much about it.\n\n"

Puke.

      "content": "_cemetery messed up and forgot to mention they only use granite and have crappy people who make terrible design decisions for stones_\n\nThis sounds typical. Most granite is machine cut, and the lettering looks just awful. Very few people can cut granite by hand, because it is so hard. The large grey slabs on the back of the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London are some of the only pieces of hand carving in granite I have seen. Michael Harvey designed them, but he hired a much younger and stronger person to cut them. This stonecutter worked one day on and one day off, because by the end of a day of cutting the granite he could barely hold the chisel. It is brutal on the muscles in the hand and wrist.\n\nSpeaking of Michael Harvey, his Moonglow typeface (available from Adobe) would be a good, distinctive choice. I first saw these letterforms cut in raise relief on stone by Michael during the 1997 ATypI conference in Reading. The outline style works well very large. There are also a good range of weights and widths in this family, so getting the right balance for the stone will be easier. In the mockup below I've used the semibold extended.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103005716im_/http:/typophile.com/files/STERNjh.gif)\n  \n\\_\n\nThis is a difficult decision to make for a close family member. I hope some of these comments are helpful.\n\n"

I had John Downer paint my house number sign using Iowan Oldstyle numerals (a slightly modified weight, between the regular and bold). David's comment about finding carvers who are typographically inclined is important. Also, have you confirmed whether the granite will be handcut or machinecut?

There are lots of sandblaster guys around who will just use a template. If you can find a guy with real old-world skills, work with him and ask his advice.\n\nTo me, the busier the font, the less likely it is to work carved. I would stick with short serifs. The shadows and highlights of the v cut will give the feeling that the serifs are bigger than they are. The rest is all about the person you are remembering. What feels right for their personality? Would a more relaxed straight make sense or a more formal rigid line?  \nI guess that wasn't much help since I did not give you a specific type but I can't without knowing the person.\n\nMy condolences on your loss,\n\nChrisL\n\n"
