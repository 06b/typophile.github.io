      "content": "Just guessing here, but this looks like a pastiche from the era of photo-lettering in the 1960s to 1980s.  \nThe distinctive wedge serif on leg on the h, and the wedge shaped crossbar on t, are features of a pre-WWI era serifed font sold by American Typefounders as Invitation. The sagging bowls on g and p were the height of font design fashion circa 1910.  \nCan't say if this was a full font or just enough to design the book title.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "ATF 1923 is a magnificent specimen publishing effort. Print copies are rare.  \nInvitation is also in ATF 1934 -- a much less extensive book --at page 133. Readily available in an accurate reprint by Schiffer in 2007. ISBN: 978-0-7643-2770-4. Currently priced at only $19.95 for direct sales from the publisher.  \nOnline copies of ATF 1923 & 1934 are disappointing.  \nDon\n\n"
