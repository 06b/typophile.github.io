I heard a rumor that a new edition will be out soon. I hope it's true.   \n   \nThe Phil's Photo book is a good one for older styles, but remember that those are film types, and although many of them may also have digital versions, not all of them do.   \n   \nIf you can still get the Precision Type Font Reference Guide, it's a good value. I also like that it shows the complete fonts in all the weights. The Font Book samples are sometimes incomplete when trying to see the other weights than the main one used for each face.   \n   \nMy list of my own font book collection is shown on my [Typographic References](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125800/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/FontBookList.html) page.\n\n"
