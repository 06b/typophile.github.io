  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI’ve experience a quite fuzzy thing: Exporting a font two times from _FontLab_, no known changes in the output settings.  \nThe 1. font is the red text below, the 2. is the white text.  \nThe only thing that was changed in between the 2. font-exports was the numbers ( **0 – 9** ) and the punctuation ( **,.;!?“”** …) not displayed here.\n\nIt appears to be that now the Bitmaps are not the same anymore (especially the horizontal stems in **a, e, s** and **h** in the attached 300% example).  \n_Anti-aliasing method_ is set to _sharp_ in _Photoshop_, but this it seems has nothing to do with the different jittering in the result.\n\nAny help or hint is highly appreciated!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Raster\\_Bildschirmfoto 2013-01-29.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051753/http:/typophile.com/files/Raster_Bildschirmfoto%202013-01-29.png) | 12.54 KB |\n\n",

If it's the former, try making the leading in Photoshop constant (although there are more robust -but trickier- fixes that can be done within FontLab); if it's the latter make sure you're not doing some auto-hinting before export (or just turn the hinting off).\n\nhhp\n\n"

The displayed font is generated digitally on a screen, so no work around possible.\n\n"
