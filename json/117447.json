From my own searching and peering, it looks like Optima Bold, but without the swelling(?) at the terminals.\n\nAnyway, if someone could be kind enough to point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Example](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701134901/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%20005.jpg) | 90.84 KB |\n\n",

I suspect that was an easier way to re-create a font that had much of the same feel, without exactly copying the font. Your sample may be one of those Optima look-alikes.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701134901im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OmniSample_5608.gif)\n\n"
