  "content": "Well, this is my first attempt here, although i've just been looking for a while. This forum seems fantastic. The range of knowlege really surprised me.   \n   \nI'm just getting into typography. I design as a hobby, so I don't have a large collection of fonts. I'm designing with free fonts and prepackaged stuff, which is sad, considering how many beautiful faces I've seen on this forum alone.   \n   \nAnyway, I could use a critique for this logo:   \n   \n ![Subliminal Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108093036im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20446.gif)   \n   \nIt is set in a free font called Forgotten Futurist. Really, I've only designed by sight until now, but I'd like to learn how to do it right. Any critiques would help, and I have an extremely thick skin.\n\n",
