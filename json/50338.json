  "content": "Hi guys,  \nI’m creating a font that’s quite ’blockish’ in shape (rectangular/portrait).  \nI’m learning as I’m working through FontLab Studio. Reading the Manual and practical work.\n\nI was wondering...  \nIf I had a font that consisted of just, say Capitals A-Z and nothing else, and overall the glyphs were, say 5 different widths covering the 26 letters, is there a way to automatically ask FontLab to generate the same kerning width right across the glyphs, irrespective of the widths.\n\nI’m reading the Manual and trying to understand Auto Kerning, and I can do, and understand the kerning of pairs, but I cannot see where or how to ask FontLab to take in every eventuality when every unique instance of kerning would arise. Can FontLab do this by itself? (of course with me programing it in) Or do I need to kern every pair and their relationship to each other.  \nI’m reading and reading, but just probably need a wise head here to either show me a quick way, or the way they do it best.\n\nI hope I’ve made it clear, and haven’t confused you guys.  \nThe more insights from you guys, the more I learn.  \nThanks  \nKind Regards  \nDrj\n\n [‹ Need a logo, etc.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121150412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/50135 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Quark Indesign Line above/below thing? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121150412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/50445 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Or doesn’t FontLab need to know the width to automatically kern fonts?\n\nApologies, if I’m asking a stupid question. I’m learning and I just wondered if this was feasible. I already know that professional, individual (and time consuming) kerning of glyphs is the correct and professional thing to always do. Just wanted to know that if you had a regimented situation, was this possible.\n\nThanks Again for any insights.\n\n"

Sidebearings are the parameter that determine base spacing.\n\nAs I understand it, you have a blockish design with letters of various widths. You want the spacing between these characters to be exactly the same with every combination of letters. I’m going to assume that by “blockish” you mean that every letter has straight sides, even “round” ones. You want mathematically equal space between them.\n\nIf all this is true, this is not a case for kerning. You just need to set the sidebearings for every glyph to be exactly half of your desired inter-letter space. You could use Actions \\> Metrics \\> Set Sidebearings to help facilitate this.\n\nIf this description doesn’t help, then you may need to provide visuals to help us understand what you’re after.\n\n— K.\n\n"

Skewing can be helpful at times for making an italic, but you can’t just skew and leave it, there’s still a lot of work to be done. Just the same as you can take a bold and a regular and interpolate for a demibold.

Even if just for preliminary (auto)kerning, which you can then manually perfect.\n\nI think it is a good thing that certain tasks get automated — as long as it is monitored and/or perfected afterwards — especially the repetitive ones.

I made hundreds (maybe thousands) of fonts over the last 18 years, and I can’t tell you how many times contemplating the kerning and spacing have resulted in the redrawing or fine-tuning of a glyph. I review all the kerning and spacing and drawing of all interpolated instances. Everything needs to be examined.\n\n"

I’d like to say here that iKern provides a quality adequate for final production and the designer’s feedback is useful when tuning the engine, but no other adjustments are necessary afterwards. Besides it’s already happened several times that after a first reworking I had received a new version of the fonts with glyphs changed (usually f and t). Anyway in the last sentences of my “manifesto” I ask : «[...] just contact me: I’d be glad to let you test iKern. I’m always looking for good fonts». Some typophile already did it and this is the way I prefere (and it doesn’t cost anything as a test is outside of a “commercial scope”).\n\nIgino Marini\n\n"

But I do not think this would help, as exactly the kerning tools mentioned there are not publicly available (and Tal Leming seems not to answer personal emails).\n\nDrjack: honestly, I would recommend at least doing the metrics by hand, or you’ll never learn to do it right; FL contains some AutoMetrics feature, as well as a kind of auto-kerning. But:\n\n1: They are far from perfect.  \n2: Any kind of automatic setting these values won’t spare you the prolonged reading of printed texts, laid out with your font - to correct the kerning gaps. And sometimes fixing the autogenerated values is not less obnoxious than spacing and kerning everything by hand from the beginning.  \n3: Any auto-spacing/kerning depends heavily on the letterforms. The more you sway away from the classical letterform, the more uneven auto-values you will get. I.e. if the font is blocky, the autospacing/kerning has some sense (although better to avoid it altogether). If you fancy curly designs... better avoid it.  \n4: After all, you are still learning, and time-suckers like spacing and kerning are **required** to learn to do it right. If you prefer, later you can rely on auto-generation tools (even the masters sometimes get lazy), but training the eye to see the ’gaps’ in spacing/kerning would do much better service to you in the future.  \n5: And finally, would you feel this font is ’yours’, if at least a half of the work on it was done by someone/something else?\n\nIf you are mostly interested in experimenting/learning, I would recommend you to start by designing monospaced font - better to learn to do letterspacing only, than compensate bad metrics with extensive kerning. If you can do this, later you could do... well, _almost_ anything.\n\nOn more practical note: Eh, if Metrics Machine was publicly available for licensing... I’m getting tired doing everything the hardest way in FL.\n\n"

I’m doing everything manually now, and Kern pairs when the need arises.
