  "content": "Why is it nowadays there is no careful crafting of type for much-exposed titling for things like movies? For example the highly-acclaimed \"There Will Be Blood\" uses a typeface that is repeated yet its supposed to look gothic and somewhat grunged? Take a look at the example, with the tile, and see the \"l\"'s and the capitol \"B\"'s and \"o\"'s are the same, just like when you type them out on your computer. Wouldn’t you think the designers would take the time to build variation from repeated letter-to-letter? I know most consumers wont notice, but it bugs me to bloody hell why they cant stop being lazy and add some variation to make it custom. I see this more and more, and worry its the new age of laziness. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n[http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/4743/posters/poster4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031101402/http:/media.movieweb.com/galleries/4743/posters/poster4.jpg \"http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/4743/posters/poster4.jpg\")\n\n",

I too am curious as to whether or not a legitimate license was purchased.\n\n"

Since when is it a good idea to mix all those differnt fonts in the way that they have, and having more than one Gothic font to clash with each other? Makes my eyes bleed.\n\nAluminum, thanks for the note on the other thread. I figured someone had to bring this up, and so I did a Search to make sure, and it didnt come up. That Search function here is limited, at best. And yes, they were trying for an orgainic look, yet to our eyes, its anything but. I guess what gets me so riled up is that the mood of the poster is there, and has SO MUCH potential to make it a real work of art, yet they totally fudged it somehow, so it feels so wasted.\n\n"
