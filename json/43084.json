We have an confidential advisory board that helps further our mission and I am the face behind the curtain. If you have any questions, would like to use our services or report a shared commercial font, please do not hestiate to contact me directly either by email [janet@fdrc.org](mailto:janet@fdrc.org) or clicking on the link on our site: [piracy@fdrc.org](mailto:piracy@fdrc.org).\n\nAll my best,  \nJanet Moore  \nFDRC\n\n"

But I have to admit that until Tiff vouched for them I was never going to think about them seriously simply because I had no basis for doing so. I support what they are doing (I think...) but while my concern that they were just a front collecting email addresses for spam is now allayed, my new concern is that being too secret could get in the way of getting their work done. Not everybody knows Tiff after all. Maybe this is not really a problem. I am interested in understanding this better though.\n\n"

In talking to foundries it seemed as if the FDRC member list would be the ideal audience. Beyond that not every foundry is a member (such as Font Bureau or Microsoft for that matter) hence opening it up to non-member vendors and type designers via the notices posted here, on lists and blogs that type designers and font vendors frequent.\n\nHope every type designer or font vendor will consider attending, I expect we'll all learn a lot.\n\n"

If you are victimized, it's OK to say \"please don't hit me again\", but anything stronger is asking for more beats--because you can't rely on the authorities to protect you. Hence the softly-softly tactic. It's sad, but what else can you do? It would be unrealistic to imagine that a well-publicized anti-piracy campaign with industry-wide support would have any effect, seeing what has happened with music downloads.\n\nAnother approach is to ignore the swarm of gnats, and make a better product that people will want to buy rather than rip off. And write easier-to-understand EULAS. And provide consumer education. But all these are happening too, and no doubt pirates find the better products to their liking, and the attempts at reforming their mind-set very amusing.\n\nThe problem is intractable, as DTP is predicated on easy-to-copy font formats.\n\n"

Going after little Betty and her font collection under the bed is probably not a good idea.\n\n"

The general idea in the states is that those media do have value, but that some people enjoy somehow getting free access to them. By contrast, fonts are just there, they grow on trees or are made by machines, and have no value **because** you can get them for free. Note: I'm not saying this difference exists, I'm saying the attitude, and the awareness it comes from, is very different. Do you not see that?\n\n"

But teachers need to be the bringer of reality on that score. They must do their part in educating the students correctly. The teachers who share fonts are not doing their students any favors at all.

People (present company excluded, of course) have no concept of what anything is worth.  \nBlame the Wal-Mart [gallon-of-pickles,](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124161304/http:/www.fastcompany.com/magazine/77/walmart.html) executive compensation packages, and font bundling.\n\nBut really, what does it matter what anything's worth? Smart people are the ones who get as much as possible for as little as possible, without getting caught, so why pay for something if you don't have to? Why bother to even think about what it's worth?\n\nI was talking about fonts with a freelance graphic designer I bumped into at a party, and asked him where he got his from. He said a buddy of his gave him a CD full. I'm pretty sure he had no idea how many fonts there were on it, or what it would cost to licence them, and didn't care. He knew I was a type designer but it didn't phase him--probably didn't make the connection that he may have been using my fonts for free.\n\n"
