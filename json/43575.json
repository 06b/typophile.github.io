That seemed pretty simple, something like application/vnd.fontforge-sfd.\n\nBut if there were a convention for font types, then I should follow that. And if there is no convention for font types there should be.\n\nAnd that is really my question:  \nNo one seems to have registered MIME types for the standard font formats with IANA. I think that should happen, otherwise there will be a proliferation of \"x-\" types with no consistency. Given that no one has done this, should there be a standard format like\n\napplication/vnd.font-truetype  \napplication/vnd.font-opentype  \n...\n\nor should things be just\n\napplication/vnd.truetype\n\n"

You have the Mac FFIL and LWFN resource fork structures, you have the .pfb and .pfa data fork structures along with the auxiliary files .pfm, .inf and .afm.\n\nI think it would do good to just forget any attempt to clean the old Type 1 mess up and just proposed one MIME type for the one font format that is currently of interest, that is ISO/IEC 14496-22 (Open Font Format), also known as OpenType.\n\nAdam\n\n"

Best to avoid proliforation of MIME types.\n\nI still think there is a use to having a MIME type for type1 pf[ab], because there are still a lot around and the distinction between ASCII and Binary doesn't affect most font consumers (and the less common formats are ignorable).\n\nBut you are right that an OpenType MIME is the most important.\n\n"
