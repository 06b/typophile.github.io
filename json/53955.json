What would a commercial purpose that I \\*don't\\* profit from be?\n\nI've just started trying to freelance and when I need to get permission to use a font for a project is still a bit of a mystery to me, any help there would be appreciated.\n\n",

You could use the font to create an identity for Halliburton or some other upstanding company, and providing you were not paid to create the identity (you could have them pay a friend, or donate the fee to charity), they could use it.\n\nOf course you would have to remain anonymous and not have your name associated with the work, otherwise you might \"profit\" from it indirectly given the positive PR around the logo.\n\n"
