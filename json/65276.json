  "content": "Hi all, I’m working on a logo and looking for a font with a really small x-height. I started off with Bliss, but – concerns just one Dutch word in SC – it’s too dominant. Which is a pity, I like Bliss.  \nSo it has to be a sans, otherwise I would have chosen Mrs Eaves Petit Caps, or something similar.\n\nAnybody got any suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance, Brieck.\n\n",
