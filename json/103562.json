This font had its genesis in a logo sketch for the Anaheim Angels baseball team—thus its name.\n\nType purists may be appalled by the lack of adherence to traditional forms, but the font should be seen as only “in the spirit of” blackletter, and attempting something that hasn’t been seen or done before—something that feels traditional, yet at the same time fresh and perhaps unexpected.\n\n",
