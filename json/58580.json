That G in VEGEMITE is going to be a challenge, because that is probably a custom logo.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I can't seem to get his website to open ( [www.treacyfaces.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130315120647/http:/www.treacyfaces.com/ \"www.treacyfaces.com\")), but you could see them there. However, looking at hte sample in the old FontBook, the C seems more closed than your sample.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
