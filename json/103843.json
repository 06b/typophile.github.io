The closest I found with a quick check was [Seravee](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014220338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/stawix/seravee/). The designer has replaced the head serif with a loop. Perhaps someone knows of a font that does this. I don't. To create the k and similar letters you could start with Saravee, or a closer Didot variation, and make loops.  \nDon\n\n"
