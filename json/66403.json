The class has a very limited capacity so if you'd like to attend it would be wise to book early.\n\nGet more info or sign up [here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150108113754/http:/cooperunion.augusoft.net/index.cfm?method=ClassInfo.ClassInformation&int_class_id=647&int_category_id=2&int_sub_category_id=19&int_catalog_id=0)\n\nThere is a nice article on John's work on a shopfront in Brooklyn on Hannes Famira's [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20150108113754/http:/www.typedu.org/dynamic/blog/signpainter), the source of the image below.\n\nJohn Downer is a sign painter by trade, with a specialty in gold leaf lettering. He has a B.A. in Fine Art from Washington State University and both an M.A. and an M.F.A. in Painting from The University of Iowa. He began his career as a freelance type designer in 1983. Mr. Downer writes about type and type history for Emigre magazine, House magazine, and other publications. He lives in Iowa City, and travels widely in the United States and Europe, always on the lookout for interesting letterforms. His digital type has been released through Emigre Fonts, Inc., The Font Bureau, Bitstream Inc., Design Lab, Inc., and House Industries.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150108113754im_/http:/typophile.com/files/JohnDowner_12_6654.jpg)\n\n",

True Sign Painters are hard to find these days. John Downer is truelly a Master Sign Painter. I have taken private lessons with John and I was impressed not only with his manipulation of letters with the brush but his vast knowledge of lettering and font design.\n\nI highly recommend this and truelly wish I could attend this class. If you have the means then you would be wise to attend.\n\n"
