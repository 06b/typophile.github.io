  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm having a tough time finding a font for my husband's (yep-another result of our bad economy) resume. He works or worked in the financial sector. The current resume is in Times and it pains me to look at it, yet I can't find a font that is \"strong\" enough (his words-he wants it to look strong) to match it. Simple, sophisticated and strong-no sans. So silly, but I think I'm too close to it and afraid to choose the wrong font and sabotage potential job suitors. I'd appreciate any ideas...\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Tried Garamond, Caslon and they didn't have the no nonsense heaviness and contrast that Times has. Arnhem is beautiful and right on target, but too expensive for us right now. Aluminum, you made me laugh here-bite your tongue for saying that on a font-lover's website. :o) Yes, I guess since he is in the financial field, it doesn't really matter. I guess I'm envisioning some person in HR, exhausted from looking at Times resumes all day, and then she happens upon my husbands resume and feels a sense of calm that makes her take a second look (because of his carefully chosen font, of course.) Very silly. But really, this has spurned a question in my head-are there any well-known fonts that are Times-like?\n\n"

If you use a font the employer doesn't have, Word may default to Courier, so it's best to use a font almost everybody has. I like EK's suggestion of Georgia, because just about everybody has it, but it looks more sophisticated than Times (and the old style figures are a nice touch since your husband is a numbers guy).  \nIf you're sending a Word file, set it up correctly. Use styles instead of manual formatting. Avoid _Based on Normal_, as the recipient may have different _Normal_ settings than you do. Never use extra hard returns to create space above headings and list entries; make this an attribute of your paragraph styles. Ditto for indents. Turn on smart quotes.  \nAnd for heaven's sake, spell everything right. Your husband wouldn't _need_ a job if he had a dollar for every \"Principle Engineer\" out there.\n\n"
