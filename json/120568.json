  "content": "Hello,\n\nTrying to identify the typeface for the title and subtitle of [this essay](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112022/http:/gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k33290n/f233.tableDesMatieres). The two lines are:\n\nHISTOIRE DE DESTRY  \nET DU PAYS SAULNOIS\n\nThis issue of the journal was published in 1913, so the font would have to be at least that old, probably older. The page you see there is a scanned reproduction, so the quality isn't great, and the letter range is minimal, but at least large enough to show some distinctive features. The letters seem to be designed to have a tall look to them. The curves on the \"D\" and the \"O\", for example, seem elongated on the vertical plane. The \"H\" and the \"R\" are very distinctive. The cross-bar on the \"H\" is about 1/3 distance from top, not center. The \"R\" has a very unique tail(?) that descends the baseline — sorry, I don't know all the terms for letter parts.\n\nI'm pretty sure the typeface changes at least three times after that, so the title/subtitle are unique from everything else on the page. The first change begins with \"PAR L. MAUJEAN\". You can see the \"L\" and the \"E\" here are different than in the main title/subtitle. The second change begins at \"MEMBRE TITULAIRE\", which appears to be using small-caps. And the main essay copy, beginning with \"PREFACE\" seems to be different yet again; the \"P\" and the \"E\" being obviously different than the title/subtitle.\n\nAny insights for the title/subtitle typeface are appreciated, even if I just knew the name.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Romana Book (variation) \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [donshottype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112022/http:/typophile.com/user/205259 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
