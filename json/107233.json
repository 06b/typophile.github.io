  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a bizarre client who wants a new type family to use across all communications. She likes futura but doesn't want to use it, she wants something like futura. She's a strange lady.\n\nCan anyone recommend a family with range of weights, all with italics and condensed & bold condensed for display? It's a big client so budget isn't a problem.\n\nI like Super Grotesk but no italics unfortunately!\n\nLove to hear some ideas.\n\n",
