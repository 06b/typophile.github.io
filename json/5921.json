They wanted the target line to go through the words as if the stone was being cut. I did a second version with an abstract image to display precision and technology. Any advice taken - they are in a hurry and not paying a great deal for this.   \n ![Version 1](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108172351im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42120.jpg) ![Version 2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108172351im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42121.jpg)\n\n"

What kind of stone do they work in? Is it rough textured stone-implyed by the rough edges of the word \"stone\" Is it smooth marble tiles? Both? Stones for floors? walls? both? rock shaped stones or cut tiles?\n\n"

Laying tile is not a mechanical excersise, it's done by hand. There are bound to be some alignment errors that happen when laying tile. You might try something more SHABBY SHEAK/ Earthy. Right know the logo feels too Concrete, not enough class and sophistication in the typography. You might also try a Typeface that is based on PRECISION ie Bodoni or Didot.\n\n"

      "content": "The rough \"Stone\" type may appeal to lowest common demographic (AKA American Public), But it is not attractive.   \nI agree, the concept of the \"target\" and the line reaching out at 90 degrees has been done a lot. I think of this as something to do with lasers or light, besides this look is a bit dated.   \nI would suggest re-thinking concept. I agree with Scottt that \"Precision\" can/should imply quality and finess in craftmanship as well as mechanical/technical precision. Bold type looks bad.   \nConsider which suits this client and demographic best.   \nConsider this as well, sometimes it is possible to sell clients on something they do not personally like if you can explain to them it will benefit them financially by reachinbg their target audience. This is after all business and not art.   \nIf your clirent won't listen to you shoot him. You can always claim him pushing the target concept had something to do with it.\n\n"
