  "content": "Hello people,\n\nHaven't been here for a while, and certainly not since the start of the year, so to coincide with CNY, Happy New Year to you all. Anyway, I came for a reason, and that reason was to ask:\n\nIs [Berthold](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822211923/http:/typophile.com/wiki/H.%20berthold%20AG) [Akzidenz Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822211923/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Akzidenz%20Grotesk) available to purchase as separate weights? A client has requested we use the regular and medium weights to set their product copy… but they appear to only be available to buy as a family. Is this right?\n\nThanks for your help,  \nHigashi\n\n",

I've got a few unused weights of [Gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822211923/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gotham) gathering dust somwhere too… Thanks for the reply pattyfab!\n\n"
