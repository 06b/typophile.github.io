It says coming soon on Klim Type's website and I have been crossing my fingers, but the deadline is closing in and I will have to find an alternative. Does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative sans that has a similar combination of elegance and lightness?\n\n",

I might have something up my sleeve though, if you contact me directly)\n\n"
