  "content": "Hi, I have spent a couple of weeks looking at the site and forums etc and found a lot of interesting and useful information. But now I need some help and thought this would be a good place to start.  \nI am making a piece for a Uni project on the history of punctuation.  \nI want it to be all about the style of writing using appropriate fonts for each period of time. But I am stuck with the layout.  \nI only have 6 small paragraphs of text, and they are small. But have pictured this as a long narrow print with lots of white space. I am really struggling to find anything to help me with the layout of this.  \nAny advice/suggestions I can go to the library with would be much appreciated.  \nI have included an image of my first attempt I am aware I may need to change a few fonts and simplify the 'C's' in the background. But any advice/critisism gratefully recieved.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [punctuation-ahistorylow.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416080600/http:/typophile.com/files/punctuation-ahistorylow_0.jpg) | 145.42 KB |\n\n",
