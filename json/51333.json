  "content": "hi can you help me?  \nI'm designing a log for a company called gtp in lower case they want a modern progressive typeface but their clients are deeply conservative. They have rejected the beautiful didot that I came up with, probably rightly and are looking for sans serif faces- they like frutiger. I was wondering if any one knows of a more sans serif font that still has the two loops in the g (whats the technical name for this?) but is more modern. meta is closest but the g and t dont work well together- I could cut a bit off the t. ANY SUGGESTIONS?\n\nvery grateful- totallylucid\n\n",
