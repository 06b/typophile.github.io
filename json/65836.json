I'm interested in purchasing a new font (most likely a didone) but it is obviously not on my bill if I do.\n\nSo I've run into a problem. I know that very often designers recommend fonts and I've often wondered how do they sell it to the clients or <cite>themselves</cite> if they can't see it in front of them. I realize some of you may not need to see it to know if it will work, but I am extremely visual—I need to see it in front of me.\n\nI know that there's a testdrive on most typographer's websites, but I'm running into issues where I want to do different typefaces or different weights. Any suggestions?\n\n(I know that I can screenshot, but that's incredibly inefficient.)\n\n",
