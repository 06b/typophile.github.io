Font Book, which comes with OS X Tiger, is nice and simple but gives no kerning info.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ Get a Euri the Euro t-shirt](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122010900/http:/typophile.com/node/19155 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Check the Cache ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122010900/http:/typophile.com/node/19147 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
