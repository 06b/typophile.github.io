It’s easy to have the logo crisp on one side & soft on the other. You can move a ’smart image’ of your vecortor around by sub pixel amounts in photoshop. I am not loving the interface but it can be done. I like the UI/process used in Fireworks MUCH more.\n\nOf course without a visual reference I have no idea if this could help or not...\n\n"

I can happily write with you again about whatever - or ignore you. Either way; I have no grudge. I am making the suggestion because I honestly think you will get more out of Typophile that way.\n\n"

There’s a person here who’s known for being very rude and obnoxious and I’ve seen you supporting he/she and never have I seen you standing up for anyone that that particular person has attacked.

What is it in my behaviour that’s so offensive to you? I have asked you kindly, to please leave me alone and ignore my messages, why can’t you do that? And for the record, it’s not because I can’t argue with you or because I feel inferior, it’s for the sake of other people in this forum who naturally find our toxic interaction very unpleasant.\n\nLet me be honest with you - You don’t belong in any forum where there are human beings interacting. At least not until you are socially house-trained. Seriously, I have done nothing else except turning to people for help in a free forum, and I have never been so badly and unfairly treated in my life. You should feel ashamed.\n\n"

I know better now.  \nI know I’m not stupid. But it’s natural to feel intellectually inferior in any situation where you’re surrounded by experts in a field where you know nothing.
