I want to get feedback and assistance before I do the fine tuning.\n\nI also have a few questions.\n\n1. How is the ratio of height/width?\n\n2. What degree of angle should I use for all the diagonals? Does it look weird to mix it up a little?\n\n3. Do the ambicase styles of \"N\" and \"Y\" work?\n\n4. Should I slightly angle vertical and horizontal lines to compensate for optical distortions?\n\nThanks for taking a look!\n\n\\_eric\n\n\\*\\* EDITED Oct.19.2009: changed title from \"Blackletter Stencil\" \\*\\*\n\n",

      "content": "I think it looks quite interesting, although its looks a bit more like a 'techno' font than a fraktur. A, O and T do have real fraktur characteristics, the rest is more hybrid. This is fine, if that's what your going for. I think it is also hard because fraktur typefaces are hardly ever set in all caps (except perhaps for one or two words) and for good reason: it is almost illegible in all caps! So I guess if you want to make this work as caps only you will have to go for this kind of hybrid.\n\nI can't answer all your specific question (simply cause I don't know) but I'll give my voice on some.\n\n1. I think this is pretty good, it's got enough light in it to keep it legible.  \n3. I think this looks nice, and if your going for a hybrid, this would fit.\n\nGood luck with it and keep us posted on your progress\n\nJeffrey  \n [infraordinaire](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416053633/http:/www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress)\n\n"

      "content": "No doubt, it turned out heavily on the techno side. I started out with a mix of curves and angles. I let the characters resolve their differences between themselves. As it turns out, they voted curves off the island.\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\n"

I like this a lot..\n\nthe only thing that I have some troubles is the square in the A.  \nit reminds me of and Adolf H.-moustache... perhaps it is because it is the letter A.  \nKeep up the good work!!\n\ndid you try the A and O like this?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416053633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dirt_4743.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Good look, Kay! Thanks for the feedback! Your changes are good ones. That brings \"A\" and \"O\" closer to the rest of the glyphs. Alas, I have put this typeface on hold for awhile which I look for a job.\n\nI'm just starting out with FontLab and designing my own fonts. I think I will work on something more conventional before revisiting this face. And, of course, anything I work on will be posted here to get all the help I possibly can. I will hit you up for feedback in the future, if you don't mind.\n\n"
