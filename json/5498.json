  "content": "Hi guys,   \n   \nSometimes when I'm designing I want to preview a font just to see if I like it. I have a lot of stuff offline, but don't want to go the whole time online to preview it. I also don't want to install it in FontAgent and remove it after 2 seconds when I see it's not the font I was looking for.   \nBefore I used FontGander to preview my fonts and that worked perfect for me. But now that we are on OSX I can't seem to find a (preferably) freeware program that allows me to see a font before I install it. That's too much of a hassle and could mess up my allready installed fonts.   \n   \nIs there someone that knows a good program that meets my expectations?   \n   \nThanks,\n\n [‹ Tattoo font...](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024181155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5432 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#39;Whitney&#39; by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024181155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5486 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I looked around a bit more and found 'Font Showcase'. I'm testing it right now and must say that I kinda like it. It workes much like FontGander. It will allow you to load an external folder which contains fonts. Or you can just load one single font.   \nIt allows you to use your own text string to see the characters. This is good, because mostly I need the font for a specific logo or name. You can change this into any text you want.   \nIf you want to see the whole character set, use the 'Character View' option, which surprisingly brings up an extra window. Here you can see all the glyph boxes with it's number and keyboard combination. This only works with installed font though. An external font will not be previewed. And that's just what I wanted.   \n   \nAll toghether it workes fine for now, but Ithink I'll find something better. I'll have a serious look at the other suggestions and let you know.   \n   \nThanks,\n\n"
