I see how you've made it from pieces of \"f\" (well, long \"s\") and \"s,\" but this might be an overly-literal way of approaching the character.   \n   \nThe numerals are nice, with the exception that the eight looks a little bottom-heavy (actually, top-light, or \"pinheaded\"). Also, although this is by no means an objective judgement, the \"sideways,\" Stempel-Garamond-esque zero was something I could never get used to. In the context of \"rough\" signage types, though, it might work.   \n   \nFinally: great asterisk!\n\n"

Fairfield also has them.   \nThey're particularly gorgeous in the heavy   \nweight.   \n   \nAnother interesting approach to zeroes can be   \nfound in Berthold Bodoni Old Face (not Antiqua).   \n   \nThis is a great design. The f-ligs might be   \nbuilt a bit too wide, but I'm not sure unless   \nI see them in a properly kerned run of text.\n\n"
