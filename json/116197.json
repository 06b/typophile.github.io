I'd probably start with some neutral sans like [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20140830160811/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Avenir) or [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20140830160811/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Futura), keeping /B, /e and /s (the only letters I think that are still untouched) and customized all the rest.  \nOut-of-the-box alternatives: [Chalet](http://web.archive.org/web/20140830160811/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet), [All Round Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140830160811/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/all-round-gothic), [Dessau](http://web.archive.org/web/20140830160811/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/dessau_pro)\n\n"
