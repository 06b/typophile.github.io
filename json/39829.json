You could say \"publications\", much like you could say \"substances abuse\" or \"customers' satisfaction\". Is there a term for this that I can use to mine info?\n\n",

      "content": "It probably sounds odd to you because you're thinking of concrete \"publications\", which is a count noun. We don't tend to say \"three volumes of publication\" the way we say \"three sheets of paper\" or \"three grains of rice\". In the phrase \"as it appears in publication\", the word \"publication\" belongs in the same category as abstract mass nouns like \"science\" and \"typography\"; it refers to the _act_ of publishing and the whole of all things ever published everywhere.\n\nThe fact that nouns aren't pluralized when used as modifiers, as in \"substance abuse\" and \"dog catcher\", is unrelated.\n\n"
