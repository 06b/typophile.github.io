I also sell my stuff through my own website, but the vast majority of income for type sales comes from MyFonts.  \nAnyway, well done, and I am sure this will be the first of many now you have been bitten by the bug.\n\n"

It means a great deal to me to get such positive feedback from fellow typedesigners.\n\nMartin, I've been absent a while myself, but thanks a lot! The (very) basic character set of the serif is pretty much finalized, but I wouldn't expect a release anytime soon. I'm having very little time for typedesign at the moment, and the redrawn Proza Web, and Proza Display have my priority.\n\nOn marketing: The marketing of fonts is not as simple as you paint it. Having a succesful typefoundry is as much about your reputation as it is about your work, especially if you want to do client based work in the future. Myfonts, despite its superior position in font sales, is mostly a shitpile of crappy typefaces. I would advise any starting typedesigner to join the fontshop before joining myfonts, establishing some sort of a professional reputation before going for the big money.\n\nI've been in contact with Myfonts though, and I'm really impressed with the way they're improving the quality of their library, so I've decided to join them sooner or later.\n\nNick, yes that's right. Let's hope you're right :)\n\n"

I wrote an entire article on the development of Proza ( [http://ilovetypography.com/2013/11/01/making-fonts-proza-typeface/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414192209/http:/ilovetypography.com/2013/11/01/making-fonts-proza-typeface/ \"http://ilovetypography.com/2013/11/01/making-fonts-proza-typeface/\")), and I've been open about the design process from the very start, so it's certainly not a rip-off. That, and I am certainly not the only one who feels there's enough room between Cronos and Proza. It might turn out to be hard to rid myself of this rip-off reputation, but if I continue to deliver original quality over the coming years, I'm confident I'll get there. That's all I have left to say.\n\n"

      "content": "Oh you certainly need to guard the reputation of your type foundry, but from my perspective anyway releasing your work through MyFonts doesn't harm your reputation. As far as I'm concerned it actually establishes/verifies your reputation.\n\nAlso, I don't like Fontshop. I go there once in a while if a typeface can't be found elsewhere, but it's definitely not a go-to spot for me when it comes to typefaces. I'm convinced by the quality of the fonts but I just don't like the website itself. You will probably find that most typefaces from Fontshop are also released through MyFonts, so I think it's an overgeneralisation when you say most fonts on MyFonts are crap. You can say that about websites like Dafont but MyFonts does a lot more quality control. They probably don't do as much quality control as Fontshop but they make up for that with their categorisation and validation systems. I find you actually have to work to get to the subpar fonts because the system is built on showcasing the most popular works, of which most have been validated by end users. The system works so well in fact that I'm always aware of most professional new releases and award nominations shortly after their release. In the end I actually get the feeling that MyFonts and Fontshop are more similar than you might think in terms of quality of fonts. It's just that Fontshop's target audience are generally professional designers while MyFonts speaks to a larger audience.\n\nI think you can rightfully say that being on Fontshop helps to establish and validate your reputation, but I doubt being on MyFonts harms your reputation. I think perhaps you're thinking too much of the value of exclusivity regarding foundries like TEFF and Dutch Type Library. They don't offer their fonts on MyFonts because it's not a similar target audience. With Proza you ARE speaking to a similar target audience, and so rather than a clever marketing strategy I think you're just excluding part of your target audience. Also, the fact that you're giving away a weight for free to me goes against the notion of exclusivity. I just don't think exclusivity is necessarily as important as you make it out to be.\n\n"
