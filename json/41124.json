So I am asking once more ...\n\nDoes anyone know if and where I can obtain a copy of the iKern application? I saw on [http://www.iginomarini.com/ikern.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203213835/http:/www.iginomarini.com/ikern.html) that the application is available for purchase but, as someone else noted in another post, Mr. Marini’s contact information don’t seem to work.\n\nIn addition, I downloaded the DTL Font Master Light Suite but I saw that the autospacing feature in the KernMaster application doesn’t work on this version of the software (as it says). Is this actually the case or did I do something wrong?\n\n [‹ Optical Weights MM](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203213835/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41097 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [unicode for alternates ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203213835/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41070 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
