  "content": "This is my first post. I'm a graphic designer, or at least that's what the guy calls me who gives me money.   \nAnyway, he's getting into book publishing and I helped him with a name and then it was a matter of designing a logo.   \nI suppose I won't give any background, as I'm interested in first impressions. I think it conveys an idea. Comments and critiques greatly appreciated.   \n ![Scapegoat Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023143227im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49678.jpg)\n\n",

It got a nice, traditional, 'vintage' look ( and feel ) to it..   \n_But, maybe you want to leave some more space between 'SCAPEGOAT', the horizontal line, and 'PUBLISHING'.. Or, try one version without the line, at all, maybe.? And, make sure that the fine details of the logo wont get lost when printed smaller, or getting faxed.._\n\n"
