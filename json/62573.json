  "content": "Chennai is a simplified sans serif that was first available in 2007. It also includes a number of more traditional alternate forms. I enjoying coming back to older work and making modifications and adding additional weights, and am planning a rounded slab serif based on this design. I've attached a preview image below including the thin, regular and black weights. I welcome constructive comments. Thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173312im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Chennai-Sample-Page-Source_6450.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Made a few minor updates to Chennai. There are three main styles. The swash alternates add more of the curved stems/tails (line 1 and 7). The stylistic alternates convert the lowercase simple forms to more traditional, Futura like forms and the caps are the traditional forms for X W Y and A, etc, and B, D, P, etc. are not longer rounded (scattered through the preview). The titling alternates get rid of the \"tails.\" (line 2)\n\n[Chennai PDF here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173312/http:/www.insignedesign.com/downloads/ChennaiC2.pdf)\n\nPlease take a look and give me some feedback. How is the 'e' looking?\n\nI've also attached a preview of Chennai Slab. The lowercase ball terminals on the s are a problem. I am thinking that for the black weight, I will drop the ball terminals.\n\n[Chennai Slab PDF here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173312/http:/www.insignedesign.com/downloads/ChennaiSlabC.pdf)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173312im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Chennai-Slab-Sample-Page-Source_6198.png)\n\nLooking forward to your comments!
