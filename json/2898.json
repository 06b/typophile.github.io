I am forever talking about going somewhere else. It is the nature of this beast. That's why I like boats, it seems more normal to move around in a boat. But land? First of last week I was off to St. Petersburg, then changed my mind and decided to buy an apartment in Poland. Turned out it was in the middle of one of the world's largest coal mines. They named two terminal diseases after the place. So I decided Bosnia was the place for me. Split, nice coastal town. I was wondering if they had Dalmatian dogs there.   \n   \nI can not blame it on the weather. That's what boats are good for. Excuses.   \n   \nSo this would be something to stick around for. Maybe I could gather up some interesting material. I am not sure how easy that would be. I have something you would all love to see. Or hate to see! Either or,\n\n"
