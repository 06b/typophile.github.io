  "content": "Previously, I started a thread about [The Concept of Stripping Down the Serifs](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804024923/http:/www.typophile.com/node/114952).  \nNow, let's go back to time, back to the Middle Age.  \nI still wonder who first conceives sans serif typefaces based on blackletter calligraphy? Should I say **Blackletter Sans** , in other words, blackletter without terminals.  \nWilliam Morris, Rudolf Koch or Tom Carnase and his [_Honda_](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804024923/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/honda/)?  \nSome recent designers work and exploit geometric moduls combined with a heavy weight which give the flavor of blackletter: see [_Trigot_](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804024923/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/volcano/trigot/) or [_Griffensee_](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804024923/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/gryffensee/).  \nFell free to give your interpretation. Thanks for your input.\n\n",
