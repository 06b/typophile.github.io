  "content": "Dear Typophile community.\n\nThis logo is for a small [architecture firm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135/http:/omkrets.se/) in Stockholm:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135im_/http:/typophile.com/files/omkrets-20dpc-black_4719.png)\n  \n [(high resolution here)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135/http:/omkrets.se/common/omkrets-logo2-hires.png)\n\nIt is based on the typeface [Orgasmia Outline](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135/http:/t26.com/fonts/Orgasmia) by Brito Renato (t26.com) but I have altered the \"o\" and the \"t\" to make every letter consist of (only) one self-intersecting line.\n\nI like how the letters are both pixel-based and drawn with a line.  \nThe name \" o m k r e t s \" means \"circumference\" or \"orbit\" (sort of) in Swedish.\n\nPlease tell me what you think!\n\nThanks!  \nMårten\n\n",

I applaud your desire to be creative, and I can see the effort that went into this.\n\nHowever, honestly, it's rather difficult to read.\n\nIt's not going to be particularly useful in tiny sizes—a good logo should be readable under even the most stringent, adverse conditions.\n\nVery faddish and likely to seem anachronistic in the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd most importantly, no concept. What's the idea? What's it trying to say? If their name means circumference or orbit or something to that effect, perhaps that would be a starting point for an idea-based logo as opposed to just a really cool typeface logo.\n\n"

I tried these fonts first:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135im_/http:/typophile.com/files/omkrets-easyscript_4846.gif)\n  \nEasyscript from [Lineto](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135/http:/lineto.com/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135im_/http:/typophile.com/files/omkrets-kulukundis_5183.gif)\n  \n [Kulukundis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kulukundis-itc/)\n\nAlso, the single stroke look (especially rounded endpoints, like in Easyscript) I think relates to architectural drawings in a way.\n\nI hope this clarifies the intention.  \nPerhaps there is a better way to express it in the logotype?\n\n"

When I look at that first version it goes in the direct opposite of what I was expecting to see.\n\nI'm not saying that a scrpt or serif wouldn't work that was just the first thing that came to mind.\n\nEncircling space in an orbiting fashion is a cool idea though. You could try to have the encircled space form the letters and the orbiting space filled with a color, could create some interesting forms. Might be difficult with some letters but it would be interesting to see.\n\n"

I'm not sure I understand your idea about \"the encircled space form[ing] the letters\" could you try to explain more please?\n\nI also just tried this (don't laugh!):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dont-laugh_6309.PNG)\n\nI like the \"e\".

      "content": "\\>_It’s about enclosing or encircling space in an orbiting fashion._\n\nFor what it's worth...\n\nRaw pure Architecture (cap. A) is not about enclosing or encircling space... _It_ 'moves' with space and is 'of' space - just as you 'move' and are 'of' Life (cap. L). And if you really want to get down to it, it's space that defines mass. Beethoven wrote that he composed the space _between_ the notes...\n\nA current trend/fashion in architecture (lower case 'a') is deconstructivism (think Gehry et. al), and to that flavor I think your concept is somewhat appropriate.\n\nBtw, take a look at the work of Torii Ippo and his contemporaries at: [http://www.textilearts.com/bamboo/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135/http:/www.textilearts.com/bamboo/index.html \"http://www.textilearts.com/bamboo/index.html\") .\n\n...I'm beginning to ramble.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nHiro\n\n"

I don't think so. Many other forms can be 'precise' or 'simple' in a much more interesting way. Also, a circle is not the only thing that has a 'circumference' (omkrets), right?.\n\nI don't want to emphasize on the circle too much because I think this interpretation is narrowing down the concept of 'omkrets' to just 'circumference of a circle'.\n\nHowever I have chosen three typefaces that I like, with circular 'o' just for you!\n\nGlaser Stencil:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135im_/http:/typophile.com/files/glaser%20stencil_5485.png)\n\nMostra:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mostra_5429.png)\n\nVariex:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044135im_/http:/typophile.com/files/variex_4635.png)\n\nWhat do you think? Was there another typeface you had in mind? Please show me!\n\n@Hiroshige:  \nInteresting point.  \nLuckily, architecture is wide enough to embrace any definition of it.\n\nThere were some amazing designs on the Bamboo page! Thanks for sharing this link. I think I could be happy spending the rest of my life making baskets. It seems tricky though, ten years just to get started...\n\nThanks!  \n/Mårten\n\n"
