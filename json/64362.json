When I was printing I used a Vandercook SP15 Press and printed books and brochures, and used monotype. I was self-taught which meant that I made a lot of mistakes. But I learned a lot. This is a picture of the press I used.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055141im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SP15_5985.jpg)\n\n"

A composing stick would be nice though.\n\nWhen I gotten my 5x8 Kelsey, four years ago, it came with a similar assortment of fonts, leads and spaces, except everything was simply pied (dumped) into an old cardboard box filled with dead roaches and mice droppings.

Its not expensive, but its only junk, what someone found anywhere.\n\nWrite an email to geoff.kennett(at)ntlworld.com. He's a very close letterpress friend of mine.
