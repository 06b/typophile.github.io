Can anyone help?\n\nAlso, as an aside, does anyone know off the top of their head what I am looking at for the actual film logo. No real reason really, just would be interesting to know.\n\nCheers\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [splash\\_01\\_2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131185541/http:/typophile.com/files/splash_01_2.jpg) | 26.64 KB |\n\n",
