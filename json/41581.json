  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’m not very familiar with the latest Quark versions and I’m  \nwondering if someone can report any similar problems - or even  \nsolutions:  \nA customer uses one of our fonts (OpenType CFF) with QuarkXPress  \n7.3.1 on Mac OS 10.4.6. If the “standard ligature” feature is turned  \non, sometimes (not always) any further editing of the text (like  \nmanual Kerning, Spacing, horizontal scaling etc.) will result in a  \ncrash of Quark (not the OS). If the ligatures are off everything  \nworks fine.\n\nIs there a known problem of Quark with OT-features?  \nThanks for any ideas!  \nOliver\n\n [‹ Font conflict with Helvetica Neue in Leopard, FontExplorer X](http://web.archive.org/web/20080405115048/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41591 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [renaming typefaces in fontbook ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080405115048/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41518 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
