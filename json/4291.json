It's an old photo display font called Caslon Black Italic:   \n   \n ![caslonblackitalic](http://web.archive.org/web/20130615060028im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33508.gif)   \n   \nI suspect that whoever did it scanned it from an old specimen book and redrew the characters as needed. I doubt very much that it's available as a digital font.\n\n"

The letter in the codes in the upper right refers to the source(s) of the font, but I only know the meaning of a few of them (AI=Alphabet Innovations, TS=TypeSpectra, OR=Visual Graphics Corporation...). No idea what C or R stand for.   \n   \nBy the way, if anyone does know about these codes, I'm trying to track down the meaning of \"LI\".\n\n"
