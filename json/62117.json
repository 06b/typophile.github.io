I have a copy of it from years ago that I purchased from Scangraphic.\"\n\nBesides the numerous threads here at Typophile that mentioned some aspects of the Haas Unica copyrights and unavailability, at the following link:\n\n[http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/swiss.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020150559/http:/cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/swiss.html \"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/swiss.html\")\n\nOne can find the reason why Haas Unica is no longer available and about its copyright’s controversies.\n\nStephen Coles wrote:\n\n-\"Scangraphics Digital Type Collection (which included Haas Unica) was purchased by Elsner + Flake in 2003, to which they added font-specific Euro and @ symbols in 2004. The revamped typeface was set to be sold by Scangraphic and its distributors, but Linotype is currently preventing the release, citing trademark violations. Although similarities to other typefaces often occur between foundries, it is rare that one finds typefaces that have been shelved indefinitely due to such resemblances. In truth, the real problem lies within a dispute over who owns the name Haas Unica, rather than any resemblance infringment. Haas Unica is commercially unavailable thanks to Linotype and Scangraphic. Linotype especially stands to lose a lot of Helvetica money if it ever appears.\"\n\n- \"As to Nymus’s comment: who is to stop anyone from reconstructing Haas Unica by interpolating Helvetica and Univers and fine tuning the result following the specs posted at Flickr? I can only speak for myself, but what would be the fun in that?\"\n\nGood point if one already has Haas Unica, but if one doesn’t and wants to buy it and can’t, it becomes an entirely different matter… It becomes something like the search for the Holy Grail…\n\n- \"Much better to look at what has been done before and try to do something that builds on that work.\"\n\nMaybe designing a humanist Haas Unica as it was done Stone Humanist or DIN Next or what else do you have in mind?\n\n-\"I think one of the reasons so many of you are lusting after Unica, is because it is unavailable.\"\n\nYou are absolutely right!\n\n"

I made this comment as a type designer who sees no point in slavishly copying the past.
