  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm currently working on a logo for a friends wedding and am looking for some feedback. I'm going to have to draw this logo from scratch and so am looking for some tips on how to do that successfully (I'm normally used to editing existing fonts rather than drawing them freehand).\n\nThis sketch shows how it currently looks. The letters will be filled (the second 'm' of Emma and the 'v' of Steve will be filled red). I'm generally happy with the look of 'Steve', but 'Emma' looks unbalanced due to the height of the 'E'. Any help at all is appreciated at this point.\n\nThanks\n\nDave\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Emma and Steve\\_thumb.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055459/http:/typophile.com/files/Emma%20and%20Steve_thumb.jpg) | 43.16 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "In this case \"Emma\" is dominated by \"Steve\", allthough she's sitting on his back.  \n:)\n\nI'd suggest to horizontally align \"Steve\" with the first \"e\" and take away the strong feet of \"S\", \"t\" and the second \"e\". In my opinion this would not only improve the balance between both names but also lead to a better overall Gestalt. I'd stay with the connection of \"E\" and \"S\" and would propably also combine \"m\" and \"t\". The seperation of the second \"m\" and the \"v\" feels too strict. Maybe getting the \"v\" combined to the first \"e\" and at the same time combining \"m\" and \"v\" on their right side will lead to a more subtle seperation and maybe make the heart a little less obvious, so it doesn't look so \"planned\".\n\nWould be great to see a final logo that says: \"Emma and Steve form a heart in a magically surprising way!\" Right now it looks like there's a heart with surrounding letters that read Emma and Steve, which is already very good but I think the message could be communicated in a more effective way.\n\nI really like your current approach and I'm looking forward to seeing more of it.\n\n"

I have also addressed my issues with balance a little more by making Emma arch over a little more, rather than having a tall \"E\" and then the \"mma\" all run a long the same level.\n\nThere's still quite a bit of work to do, but I feel it's definitely heading in the right direction now.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055459im_/http:/typophile.com/files/es_thumb_5071.jpg)\n\n"

Having 2 hearts would work also less well as an ampersand replacement, and the symbolism is slightly lost (i.e two names forming one united heart).\n\nThank you for your opinions though :)\n\n"
