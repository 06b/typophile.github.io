  "content": "My current project is promoting a Jazz Festival. Concept of this festival's poster is creating harmony using both typography and abstract images. I want to express \"rhythm\" feeling with typography so that i've been looking through typefaces. I've found \"Fitzgerald Black\" but it's not Bold enough for my poster design idea.
