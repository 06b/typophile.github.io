  "content": "Dear Philes and Philosophes of Type\n\nMy new design was released 8th April at myfonts.com. It is called Hermecito.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/artypes/hermecito/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121656/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/artypes/hermecito/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/artypes/hermecito/\")  \nThere are two pdfs posted at the gallery [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/artypes/hermecito/gallery.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121656/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/artypes/hermecito/gallery.html \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/artypes/hermecito/gallery.html\") – one is A4 and the other in US Letter format – containing much information and specimen text settings etc. I'm attaching the A4 brochure but, as the max. upload is 2mb, not the US letter.\n\nKindest regards  \nRafaeli\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414121656im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Hermecito5_5304.png)\n\n",
