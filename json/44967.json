I'm on a rather small screen (1024 by 768 px).\n\nAlso the scrollbar attacted to your content movie clip doesn't seem to work properly. You can scroll kinda far beyond the images.\n\n"

I'm going to fix it asap.\n\n\"Also the scrollbar attacted to your content movie clip doesn’t seem to work properly. You can scroll kinda far beyond the images.\"\n\nHm. that's unexpected.
