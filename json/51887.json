The rest are historicist.  \nThe same thing is true of typefaces.  \nMost of the types designed during the 1920s were historicist.  \nThe seminal sans serif types Gill, Futura, and Kabel were published at the end of the decade, and became established in the 1930s.  \nBut if you want to appeal to your professors, by all means write about modernism in the 1920s, because they are academics who live in a dream world divorced from reality.  \nJust remember that you will probably end up working in the real world.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021072054im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Victrola_3744.jpg)\n  \nHere is a high-tech audio ad from the 1920s.  \nThe headline type is Benton's Cloister Bold, based on the 15th century work of Jenson.  \nThe rest of the type is Goudy's neo-Renaissance design, Old Style.  \nThis, rather than a poster by someone who taught at a small Weimar art school, is what most 1920s typography looked like. \n"

Libraries are full of good books - 99% of the Internet is unsubstantiated crap, full of holes and misleading \"facts\" and biased articles by people with something to prove, so heavily slanted that you can't trust it.\n\nArt Deco is an interesting movement, but as others said here, it was marginal at the time and is only the focus of so much attention now due to its relevance to modernism and what came from it.\n\nUnfortunately much design education today focuses only on what reverberated later, looking back at it through a lens colored only by things that informed later pop & trendy styles. It's an unfortunate fact that many of the design programs I've had experience with almost totally exclude the much more interesting and philosophically intricate Arts & Crafts influence that was peaking in the mid 1920s in all aspects of design.\n\nJoshua\n\n"
