Also you should program your font that when there is no nikud under the ayin, then the alternate ayin is used. Again in the pdf it appears that this isn't the case.

The \"vocal sheva\" (sheva na') is a brief, neutral vowel, like the first vowel in the English word.\n\nTHE SAME symbol is used to represent sheva nah, and intermediate sheva (sheva meragef)\n\nThe vowel kamats can be either short or long. the SAME symbol is used to indicate both sounds. In some siddurim -- Sim Shalom, Rinat Yisrael -- a different symbol is introduced to indicate kamats katan.\n\nSo, how do we know when the Kamats is short/katan or long/gadol? with the Te'amim/ cantillation marks: if the kamats is marked with a secondary accent -- this is kamats gadol. A kamats before dagesh hazak is Kamats katan, since the dagesh hazak closes its syllable.\n\nMore grammar? :^)\n\nYou/we can get rid of Uni 05C7 (kamats katan/short)\n\nBTW, the fonts are modern Hebrew, and not Biblical.\n\n\\> there is no nikud under the ayin, then the alternate ayin\n\nI designed the ayin + alternate to work perfect with nikkud, so no problem that the nikkud will touch the ayin.\n\nAbout the rest of your post -- try to be a little bit more regular :) so I don't feel that I'm talking to myself :)\n\n"

In Hebrew publishing which I have seen the two dots next to each other is not used.\n\nSome publishers use a short horizontal line, like a dash, positioned above the letter. This is problematic when a narrow letter, like the vov, has a shva-na.\n\nOther publishers use a small asterisk positioned above the letter.\n\nBoth the meteg and shva-na are used in vocalized Hebrew texts. The meteg is used to indicate which syllable is emplasized in pronouncing that Hebrew word.\n\nThe shva-na as you mentioned is to show that the shva which appears below the character is pronounced long, as joined to the sound of the letter and vowel before it, and the letter above it. According to this grammatical rule, the shva-na can not appear above the first letter of the word.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> match an authentic Hebrew design to an authentic English design.\n\nDefine \"match\".  \nHistorically it has sadly meant formal congruence (for example matching serif structures) which simply cannot be conducive to authenticity (or functionality in a text face). See the Hebrew efforts of Gill and Schonfield for a glimpse of how bad it can get; and I really haven't seen anything much better. Alphabets aren't art; they're more like animals. And a Canaan Dog can't be happy in a three-piece suit.\n\nWhat you seem to be describing later in your post is encouraging however. The complication is that you need a \"multilateral\" system, as opposed to the sadly established approach of having one font per script, which results in either a master-slave relationship or a two-left-feet disaster!\n\nAn optimal, if -I feel necessarily- complex, system would be like this:  \n [http://themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_rome2.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031100923/http:/themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome2.html \"http://themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_rome2.html\")\n\nhhp\n\n"

The Talmud claims that even though a good match is as hard to make as the splitting of the sea, G-d actually spends most of His \"time\" making matches.\n\nSeemingly it can be done. Judging from your web site, you think so too, although I didn't see examples of Hebrew type design there.\n\nI agree with you that it is awkward and even ugly to try to join most non-Roman type designs, which are horizontal stroke dominant together with most Roman type designs, which are vertical stroke dominant.\n\nHowever, when these stroke are uniform or near uniform, then joining them together is in deed possible.\n\nSee Boruch Gorkin's Ariel Hebrew, and how it successfully works with Monotype's Ariel. The same could be done with Linotype's Helvetica and other popular sans serif type designs.\n\nI haven't yet seen examples of Schonfield's work. I've seen drawings of Gill's failure (though David's Poster 1492 is very interesting), and even created an italic version of David (Mr. Itamar David's failed attempt at Romanization of Hebrew) although Hebrew doesn't use an italic. I think it's a great script face though.\n\nBtw, I am an open minded liberal, just like the next guy. So, 3 piece suits on Canaanite dogs don't bother me, as long as they walk besides the trees of the wild side. Just not in my yard,please.\n\n"

And some of what you've written\\* seems very evocative of this extant failure. Fortunately other things that you've written exhibit a nice departure from the established one-dimensionalism. What I have done myself is the only such system out there so far (except for some \"reverse-Latinization\" efforts, like that of Carolyn Puzzovio - but those are not multi-lateral).

      "content": "My knowledge of the problem of matching Hebrew and Roman is way more limited than David or Israel, but for what it's worth, here's my view, just based on looking at English with companion Hebrew. I think that with roman and Hebrew fonts of even moderate contrast, the best solution is to design to keep the two scripts visually out of the way of one another. You can minimize the clash in a variety of ways, but that's about it.\n\nIf you have lower contrast 'sans' style, you can more easily get harmony, as you are reducing the difference between the 'rules' for Hebrew and Roman (horizontal vs vertical stress).\n\nAlso if you have smaller serifs and low contrast that can still work. I put David hebrew font and Friz Quadrata roman together in a display situation, and that was not too bad.\n\nThe drawback is that the low contrast fonts for English are not so good for text, at least in my view. Is this also true for Hebrew? Are most books and newspapers in 'seriffed' fonts with noticeable contrast?\n\nAt any rate, for extended bilingual text I don't really see a solution that closely mixes text.\n\nFor roman-dominated extended text with occasional Hebrew, or Hebrew-dominated with occasional roman, I think Hrant is right in theory: two different specially designed solutions. It ought to be possible to do solutions such as Hrant advocates, but I haven't seen it done harmoniously either way yet, which is maybe what Israel is also concerned about.\n\nI find reversed-contrast roman fonts--even Bloesma's--ungainly, but that would be the way to go for a roman subordinate to a lot of Hebrew text. The harmony with the dominating Hebrew text would be paramount, rather than the look of the roman on its own.\n\nMy impression is that there is not much English dominated with a few Hebrew words here and there. The other category seems to be more bilingual religious texts, but I may be wrong.\n\n"

The paper was redesigned (layout, fonts - sans instead of serif). Back then that was a big thing. Later on Robert Maxwell acquired the paper ( the Sunday Mirror, the Daily Mirror, the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail etc etc etc etc). Maxwell wanted to publish a new paper (weekly magazine); we worked on that; the plans were, of course, more creative and wild (layout, fonts etc etc) but he died in 1991 (there's big thing with money etc etc — a lot of info online) and so the plans (I don't know if I have samples; need to look for that).\n\nTextbook — The Horse #1 is Frank-Ruhl; David hebrew font. Books for kids — this is more the creative & wild field.\n\nMatch Latin — Non-Latin: I've tried/I'm trying, but sometimes I like it, sometimes not.
