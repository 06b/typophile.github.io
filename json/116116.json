      "content": "Most folks in the U.S. aren't familiar with that brand and symbol, so it would be helpful to describe it further and what you mean by \"tell a story\".\n\nIn general you want a symbol that relates to the product in some way, but an unrelated symbol can be made to work if people associate it strongly enough with the product, or if advertising draws a connection.\n\nFor example the MGM movie studio lion originally had little connection with moviemaking (a lion was the mascot of the designer's college), but through association it became a well-recognized symbol.\n\n"
