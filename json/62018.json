Although it was intended to be used as a display face, Motown's heavier weights can be used effectively for text as well. The angled crossbars and vertically symmetrical slabs give Motown a unique flair for a font of its class. The implied energy in these features also help give the font an athletic, youthful vibe. And it can also look quite classic when set appropriately for headlines, titles, and identities. Motown is available in Open Type format._\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211900im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0315_01_5906.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211900im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0315_04_5843.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211900im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0315_05_3782.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211900im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0315_07_5372.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211900im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T0315_10_4357.jpg)\n\n",
