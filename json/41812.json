It's a mixed residential type ares, with quite a bit of over development in high rise apartments in the 80's.\n\nThis is a quick sketch of the idea I was going for.\n\nComments appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020081501im_/http:/typophile.com/files/new-1_4420.jpg)\n\n",

That doesn't mean there can't be a focus, but right now they are three separate elements that aren't working together.\n\nThe second issue, and more important to me, is that none of the sketches are unique enough to serve as an identifier for your community. Any leafy suburb with a creek could use those logos. Maybe you should try combining those pieces with something typographic, like the K or a KL monogram that would be more unique to your town.\n\n"

Perhaps use a leaf that comes from a native tree, or an architectural element from your town. I would also recommend that you start working with your type element at this early design stage.

But since you say that \"the residents most identify with the parks and river in the area so I tried using a leaf to represent the nature\", then leave the computer and go take a walk. Collect leaves. Post pencil/pen/watercolor sketches, and then return to the computer when you've refined your idea. If the logo is inspired by the community, then it will ring far truer.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

Based on White Elm, Hackberry, Manitoba Maple and Linden in the area. Thanks for the suggestion though.\n\n"

Use your drawing skills to combine the leaf with the water in a unified shape. Consider that in a way the buildings are repeating the land/earth part of the equation already represented by the leaf.
