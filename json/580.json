  "content": "Recently, Dan Bailey of [Fontosaurus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032321/http:/www.fontosaurus.com/) teamed up with Michael Jantze, creator of the nationally-syndicated (U.S.) comic strip, [The Norm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032321/http:/www.thenorm.com/) to create a font based on Michael's comic lettering. Not unusual, in and of itself, but instead of profiting from this, we're giving 100% of the proceeds to the [Lance Armstrong Foundation](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032321/http:/www.laf.org/). The LAF provides financial grants to research groups studying the disease and to non-profit organizations that assist people fighting the disease. If our wildest hopes came true, the proceeds from [this font](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032321/http:/www.fontosaurus.com/fonts.php?target=136&display=single) would fund the lab that found the cure, but we'd just be happy if we could help one person fighting the disease make it through one more day.   \n   \n(That said, anyone else have any ideas of who I should contact to help spread the word?)\n\n",
