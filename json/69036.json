The quality of fine calligraphy is beautifully captured; it doesn't look \"false\" like so many script fonts, or stilted, which is the downfall of too \"correct\" formalism.\n\nI don't know how much of the balance it strikes is due to the distressing. Are you considering a smooth version? That would be the acid test.\n\n"

While it CAN be done, I'm not sure I have the energy to smoothen it up ... 750 glyphs and literally hundreds of nodes per glyph.
