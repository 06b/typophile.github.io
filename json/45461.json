  "content": "Hello happy people,\n\nI'm working with a font that's delivered to us (don't know the source). It's called \"A2 Happiness Bold\" and it looks like:http://users.pandora.be/xinavane/hffont.png (more on coke.be)\n\nIt doesn't have a lot of extra characters included, so I was wondering if this font were based on some other font. An 'original' which could include more characters and wheights.\n\nthanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [hffont.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20110304172142/http:/typophile.com/files/hffont.png) | 12.29 KB |\n\n",
