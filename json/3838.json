Eg: Goudy.   \n   \nAnd why do fonts with OSF always put them together with the Small Caps or something? Anyone know why?   \n   \nAlso what other sans serif font, aside from The Sans comes with OSF?   \n   \nThanks\n\n",

They're in the [expert set](http://web.archive.org/web/20130222045442/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/adobe_lib/080337000.html), so you'll either have to keep swapping or use a font editor to rearrange your own OsF version. These used to be marketed by Adobe, but I think you can only get them through Berthold now.   \n   \nA couple of the Font Bureau's sans serif fonts have OsF available -- Benton Gothic, Berlin Sans, and Petr van Blokland's [Productus](http://web.archive.org/web/20130222045442/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=1036447081260870&fontname=Productus). I think the last one comes with OsF standard. The others you may have to request specially. But if you find TheSans too costly, these may not be in your price range either.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

Since you're not there to explain to each user why they should prefer OS figs, you eventually end up with lower sales...   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
