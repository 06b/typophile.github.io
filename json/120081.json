I was wondering if it could be desaturated and made into a font somehow. I do not have the resources or the know-how to do this. If you're able to do this and don't mind, I'd be very appreciative if you could send me over the .otf or .ttf file.\n\nThanks\n\n",

I rescind my request I guess, because I do not have a budget, let alone a 5 figure budget, to work with.\n\n"
