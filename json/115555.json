As said on this page, it's a \"Refinement and finishing of a design by Rip Georges. It's based on a 1895 type specimen and first appeared on the first issue.\" A very close alternative would be [Ronsard Crystal](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082736/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/ronsard-crystal) Bold.\n\n"

      "content": "‘1895 specimen’ sounds interesting … I only knew this typeface as ‘Industria’, designed by Hermann Zehnpfund for the type foundry Emil Gursch in Berlin from 1910 to 1913. The foundry was taken over by Berthold who added more weights in 1920 and 1923.
