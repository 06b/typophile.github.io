      "content": "This is stock Futura light, the URW++ version methinks. It's not custom lettering so complaints about letter widths seem inappropriate.\n\nFutura has proportional capitals based on the carefully-worked-out ratios of the Trajan inscription. The differing letter widths harmonize in complimentary fashion. They're not designed to please people who think every element in a logo or a typeface should be uniform. It amazes me how many graphic designers and art directors evidently fail to appreciate this. Sure the N looks wide---it's meant to be that way.\n\nSince the designer has chosen this font and not one with even width caps, the best that can be done is to optimize the optical density of the composition. So we tighten up the space between C and A, and do the same for A and S.\n\nIncreasing the overall spacing makes the uneven density less noticable and adds elegance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019135002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/casini1_4364.gif)\n\n^ The large S looks unweildy to me too, so I moved it to a dropped position to allow A to be brought closer beside it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019135002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/casini2_6083.gif)\n\n^ I think this works better. A tad more letterspacing makes it a touch more elegant.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019135002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/casini3_5113.gif)\n\n^ Substantially more spacing gives a more relaxed vibe appropriate to the product(s) conducive to a life of refinement.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "_Since the designer has chosen this font and not one with even width caps, the best that can be done is to optimize the optical density of the composition._\n\nI have to respectfully disagree, James. The modulating widths in the typeface are meant to assist in readability as a text. A logotype/wordmark has different requirements. These specific letters need to hold together as a singular unit. So, I consider it necessary to adjust certain letter widths like the N and maybe the A to harmonize better.\n\nThat all said, your examples of additional letterspacing do help minimize some of the unevenness. Therein lies my biggest criticism of Casini's latest version: it all feels incredible cramped. The C and A have a nice space, but the S feels a touch too close to the A (some redrawing of the S could probably solve this). And then the INI feels like it's about to get into a fender bender and needs to back off.\n\n(edited to add italicized quote at top)\n\n"

I'd move the points closer to the centre and pull the handles out more, or even increase the angle of the diagonal.\n\nI'd also like to see a version with the \"AS\" broken at the angle of the 'S' rather than the 'A' (diagonal rather than horizontal).\n\n- Lex\n\n"

Futura's caps are based on the Trajan inscription, an all capitals affair where our present-day theories of readability do not hold true. Poportional capitals are proportional for good looks, for the purpose of display lettering.\n\n_These specific letters need to hold together as a singular unit._\n\nOh but they do hold together as a unit, if you allow them to in your mind.\n\n_So, I consider it necessary to adjust certain letter widths like the N and maybe the A to harmonize better._\n\nShow us.\n\n_The C and A have a nice space, but the S feels a touch too close to the A (some redrawing of the S could probably solve this).

So, I'd understand why you hesitate to change someone else's letterform. I don't see an error in alterations if it benefits the logo. But you are free to disagree with me and I with you.
