Does the designer use brushes or is it a silkscreening technique that causes the speckles? Or is it a little of both?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819001900im_/http:/typophile.com/files/B1A791_fullsize_6629.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819001900im_/http:/typophile.com/files/35521_9752892_l_4531.jpg)\n\n",

You can create the exact effect you like digitally, or you can play around and you could come up with something magical, be it as simple as a dull and nicked squeegee, rough texture under your paper or some judiciously placed dirt on the screen...\n\n"

Or it is a scan of faxed picture, or bad laserprinter printout. I vote for the latest.  \nBTW silkscreen could be very accurate. Macrophoto of business card I made many yers ago (for Ammirati, Puris, Lintas):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819001900im_/http:/typophile.com/files/amirati_4141.png)\n  \nmeasure in mm \n"

I used to screen print tiny, tiny little circuit boards using a stainless steel mesh, and -not sure what to call them, but sort of like pegs on circuit display boards in hydro generating plants that had less than a thousandth of an inch tolerance. The registration was set with a micrometer and a magnifying glass.\n\n"
