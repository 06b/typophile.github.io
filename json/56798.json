The \"limitation\" is that some of those devices are designed to fit in the palm of your hand (and in your pocket), which limits them to about 3.5 inches wide, with a screen no more than 3 inches wide.  \n3 inches is only enough for about an alphabet and a half of 10-point type (about as small as most of us care to read on screen).  \nThat's where the \"convenience of the reader\" makes us compromise the two-and-a-half-alphabet rule. Many readers would gladly live with a line length of around one and a half alphabets (less if it's 12-point) in exchange for the convenience of getting content on a mobile device that fits in their shirt pockets (and that they can also use to make phone calls, take pictures, find the nearest Starbucks, Tweet, calculate tips, etc.).\n\n"
