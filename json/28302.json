We all know there is ignorance among certain people and companies, not actually paying for fonts. Are there any actions taken to those? Do the foundries follow up and check these kind of things?\n\nAnother question I have is: What do the foundries do about these piracy-websites that distribute copies of great fonts and give them away for free as truetype-downloads?  \nI can easily via Google find copies of many fine typefaces.\n\n"

      "content": "Royalties range from around 15% to 65%. The rate is negotiated between the designer and the distributor and depends on a lot of factors, mainly how much or how little effort the distributor puts into promotion. Exclusivity is another big determining factor as well as whether the designer did all the development work themselves or collaborated on development with the distributor. Of course, if a designer sells directly, he or she gets the whole amount, minus transaction costs, promotion, and support.\n\nGiven this, I have set up a little scenario. Let's say you are a type designer with fonts being sold at three different distributors at royalty rates of 15%, 50%, and 65%. Let's say you would like to earn $30,000 per year from font sales. Let's also assume you only sell single fonts at a retail price of $30 each. Here is how it looks:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122202240im_/http:/typophile.com/files/scenario_4304.gif)\n\n(The bottom row represents an average of the other three rows.)\n\nThis is of course over simplified. Most designers also sell fonts in sets at a discounted price and multi-user licenses at a discounted price. This means less income per font or per user, so you have to sell more to make up the difference. In practice, though, discounts like this tend to increase sales.\n\nAnother factor is the retail price. A high price will bring in more money per font, but may result in lower sales. A lower price may increase sales but bring in less money. It's not easy to determine the best price for a font.\n\nOf course, this simple scenario does not include things like development, support, or marketing costs. And lastly, you have to have fonts that people want to buy. This may seem obvious, but is easier said than done.\n\n"

It's really striking, and surprised me when I first saw the figures. It's like (speaking off the cuff here, without looking at figures) even the twentieth ranked font probably sells 50x as much as the median ranked font.\n\nI assume it's similar for any type foundry with a large number of fonts, but I'd be curious to hear confirmation of that theory....\n\nT\n\n"
