  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm redesigning a local newspaper here in Finland (circulation 8k, twice a week, tabloid, established in 19th century) and I'm searching for a headline font. My favorites so far are [Whitney condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/whitneycondensed/index.html) and [Amplitude](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=amplitude), although its big ink traps bother me.\n\nProperties for headline font are \"humane\" and \"contemporary\", but because this is a newspaper with long history and traditional image, it shouldn't be TOO contemporary... you know the story. Condensed version would be nice.\n\nIf you have any further suggestions, I'd love to hear them. Thanks in advance.\n\n(for body text I've thought of Mercury Text, but that's only if I manage to convince paper to give up their Utopia...)\n\n",

      "content": "Christian Schwartz has actually done a version of Amplitude without the extreme trapping for use in newspaper headlines. You can find examples at his site: [http://www.christianschwartz.com/amphead.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/www.christianschwartz.com/amphead.shtml). The fonts are available through the Font Bureau Studio Library.\n\nIt sounds like you're looking for a sans serif design. But if you're open to considering a serif face, you might also look at the Whitman Display series, which was originally designed for newspaper commissions. It is currently used by the [<cite>Minneapolis Star Tribune,</cite>](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=MN_ST&ref_pge=lst) the [<cite>Tacoma News Tribune,</cite>](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=WA_NT&ref_pge=lst) and the <cite>Idaho Statesman.</cite>\n\nThe family has been recently expanded to 7 weights in 3 widths. I posted a few previews in [this other thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/typophile.com/node/33419) on a magazine redesign. The fonts are not available in Retail release just yet (we're working on it). But you can contact the [Font Bureau](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/www.fontbureau.com/) for licensing through their Studio Library.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for suggestions!\n\nAnd yes, I'm looking for a sans serif headline. The newspaper in question has used only serif headlines so far and they want to take a little distance to their oldish, conservative image.\n\nkentlew: Beautiful, Amplitude Headline is pretty much just what I'm looking for...! It has edge, but not too much. Its rectangular and round forms make a nice dynamic contrast. It's definitely contemporary, but you can imagine it doesn't get dated too soon. Thanks!\n\nkuroneko: Mercury and Whitney condensed is nice, only thing that bugs me with Whitney is that its angular cut ends have a little too much personality to my taste. Especially words with k's (we have a lot of them in Finnish) tend to look jumpy and unbalanced.\n\nIf anyone else has suggestions of headlines with similarity to Whitney Condensed and Amplitude Headline, I'd love to hear them.\n\nBTW: I'm also redesigning their logo, so I can modify its forms based on typographic choices I make.\n\n"

      "content": "I'll suggest [Shaker](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/www.typography.net/type/shaker.htm) from Jeremy Tankard. I recently bought it for my newspaper's redesign as a caption/sidebar font. I have to say that I'm not 100% pleased with how it mixes with Farnham and Merucry, the other typefaces (I think the difference in x-height between them irritates me), but I really liked it when I tried it in headlines as a demo. The italic is especially nice, IMO; I used it for a temporary nameplate while our final one was in the works.\n\nSince you said no serifs, I'll interpret that as not including slab-serifs and point out a few modern ones: [Dispatch](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Dispatch) (and its sans, [Stainless](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Stainless)), [Soho](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/www.linotype.com/3273/soho.html), and [Enclave](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055908/http:/terminaldesign.com/fonts/sets/?CID=6).\n\n"
