That worked very well in finding Adobe Present for me, but for some reason its \"fonts like this\" feature seems to go all over the map.\n\nI was looking for a font that looked a bit like Kingthings Petrock, but plainer - more like Post Roman, for example.\n\nThat doesn't even seem to exist; I found EF Karonlinger, Post Antiqua (and Scriptuale), Lucida Casual, and I even found EF Medieva... which looks like the old Magic: the Gathering font!\n\n... oh, and did I mention Sanvito?\n\n"
