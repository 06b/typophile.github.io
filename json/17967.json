The family works fine –naming and style linking– after I do a font cache cleaning. However, if I reboot after that, style linking stops working.\n\nI noticed the same behaviour with Adobe’s Pro fonts –Warnock Pro (v1.9), for example.\n\nDoes anyone have any insights on this issue? Thanks.\n\n [‹ How does ZapfDingbats.dfont work?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180832/http:/typophile.com/node/17944 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fontographer for windows?
