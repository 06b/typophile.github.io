Some little bulb shaped ink traps in the tight angles might help too.\n\nA nice tall gothic overall. the little blobs on the stroke corners almost make this a serif font. It could easily be one if they were exaggerated a touch more.\n\n"

      "content": "Given that it feels to be a very strong display face, a lowercase may not be all that important.\n\nIt definitely has a nice personality.\n\nThe only nitpik that I have is that there is some inconsistency with how the edges of the counters are treated. Some are rigid and straight, some are bowed in, and some (like on the B) are a mix. I'm not saying that's good or bad...just that it's something that seems to stick out.\n\nI agree with cuttlefish and eliason's comments as well. Do more with the Q and maybe vary a few of the others. The C might not need such large stems on the open side.\n\n"

The greater change of direction resulting from the diagonal makes them too prominent compared to the ones on the vertical strokes.\n\n"
