It may be an older proprietary font for a signmaking device like the Gerber SignMaker. You are showing us an outdoor sign to match, and an older looking one at that.\n\nThe sign industry has followed different standards for decades. Only in the last 10 years or so has some of the equipment frontends merged onto PCs. I’m sure you know this Nick, but I just wanted to remind some of the novice onlookers that NOT ALL FONTS were made for the same devices or equipment, and many adapted designs to suit the output device.\n\nEven if a sign is brand new, it depends on the equipment used (or manual adaptation if cut or painted by hand).\n\n"
