It looks like a total redesign and includes a type tester.  \nNick, when did you post the new site (or am I so far behind that I just didn’t know :-)\n\nCongrats, Nick! Lookin’ good!\n\nChrisL\n\n [‹ Looking for Linotype FontExplorer X for Windows](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033409/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37554 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [music video featuring typography ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033409/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37562 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

That’s my new marketing philosophy, although I’m finding it difficult to restrain myself from blabbering on about the types in a couple of the PDF specimens. Memo to self: features, Nick, not cultural influences!\n\nThe site was designed by Aleksey Liskovsky, who interned with me earlier this year.\n\n"
