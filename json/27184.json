  "content": "I think the font you are referring to could be MINI 7. It is a font specially designed to be used at small sizes on the web and still be readable. In fact it only comes in one size!!!   \n   \nTo improve readability at small sizes, this font is not anti-aliased. This explains why it looks like a dot matrix font when it is used in a bigger size.   \n   \nHope this helps.   \n   \nwww.manic.com.sg\n\n",
