      "content": "About spacing, from your sample, it looks as if the spacing is uniformly wide. Maybe you could set a block in Illustrator (or your favorite layout tool) and decrease the letterspacing until you find something that feels right. Then you have a good sample to improve on.   \n   \nI've found it useful to browse around my font collection in FontLab and see how others have solved the spacing problem. Finding a font with similar proportions could be a good source of ideas for spacing. I haven't tried to tackle kerning yet myself (still learning) but I'm not looking forward to it.   \n   \nWhen you say you're going to change the caps, do you mean you're going to give them the same slanted axis as the lowercase? I like how the strokes of the upper case **K** , **P** , and **R** don't close all the way. Try not to lose that idea when you fix the upper case.   \n   \nThis looks great so far. I'm interested to see what the rest of the upper case looks like.\n\n"

      "content": "I like it (I DO love long-tailed Qs).   \nThis spacing issue is pretty personal. Many people approach it in different ways.   \nI can just tell you that I experienced the same with a typeface I'm working on since 1996.   \nI did the spacing too loose because I wanted to give \"air\" but in the end I realized that if you needed a tighter textsetting you ended up with irregular results.   \nSo I discarded the whole kerning table and I began the spacing anew, from scratch, starting with the O and the |, the vertical bar (In the beginning I don't use the I or the H in serif designs for the reason mentioned by Hrant).   \nIn such way I realized that doing the face with a tighter spacing I was able to control kerning very well. And I realized also that the user could increase the space as he/she wishes in a tighter design with good metrics, while he/she cannot do the opposite in a looser design with bad metrics.   \nA starting point could be an automatic reduction of sidebearings. Then you'll correct the flaws.\n\n"

      "content": "Always start spacing with lowercase letters. Uppercase letters need to be more widely spaced relative to each other than lowercase letters do, so they're a bad place to start spacing a text face. For a text face, the best way to proceed is to start with a row of lowercase nnnnnnn's. Fiddle with the sidebearings (with a little less space on the right than on the left, to account for the curve) until you have something close to an optical balance between the internal white space of the n and the amount of white space between the letters. That will give you a standard against which to judge the rest of the spacing.   \n   \nIn a text face, uppercase letters need to be spaced to precede lowercase letters without requiring too much kerning. This is where Walter Tracy ceases to be helpful; his explanation of spacing uppercase letters only works for cap-only display faces.   \n   \nYears ago, before spacing became ingrained in my brain, I spent a long time measuring the relationship of sidebearings to internal white space in my favourite typefaces. I recommend this, since it is the best way to understand the principles.\n\n"

Because of my late typedesign love I dont learned the spacing of chars. My study was a special multimedia topic. So no calligraphy and not much typographie. At the I learned typedesign in a very unusual way. The guy from whom i learned, also made the spacing wider, and he had a position in wich I not really believe. He doesnt use any kerning pairs. I guess this position is a little to extrem. But as better the spacing as fewer kerning pairs ar needed. Isnt it?   \n   \nCurrently I am trying a tighter spacing. For the reason that i dont lost the mood I made some small caps.   \n   \nAre there any tips for the chracters? Other Flavors? This would help me also.   \n   \nGreetings Jens\n\n"
