What Ive already planned is not that much. I may be taking a look at the (Barnbrook) 'Friendly Fire' exhibition at The London Design Museum. I will of course be visiting the places Ive lived and worked the last times Ive been there. Lil' Old Truman Brewery, here I come. ;)\n\nAs always, I am very, very thankful for all suggestions and hints.\n\nThanks,  \nDav\n\n",
