My letters so far are very heavy in the curved axis' and the stems, but my thin strokes are quite thin in relation.\n\nIt almost seems somewhere in-between standard and bold. Would a bold have thicker thin strokes, and would standard have thinner axis/stems, while having a slight reduction in the thins?\n\nis Text face letter,\n\nTHX\n\n7.17.05\n\nOk, I just need somebody to look at this x. Just in the context of an x. I think it's close.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [X.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818204651/http:/typophile.com/files/X.jpg) | 120.48 KB |\n\n",

You should try a couple of letters together on a page to get a feel for how it will print. I think Noah's on the right track, but the thin parts are still too thin for text sizes.\n\n"

      "content": "Very nice. I have a few general suggestions. Don't worry _too_ much about geometric perfection with pen and paper, you can easily correct it as you draw the glyph in fontlab. There is no need to finish the font on paper (unless that is how you prefer it) you have enough of the uppercase to draw the rest directly in fontlab with the pen tool. At least, that's how I do it, if you're more comfortable sketching it all on paper first than go for it. I really like what you did with the \"P\" at the base of the bowl where it joins the stem. It will be interesting to see if the digital version has any bracketing or if you intend to make is sharply squared off. The \"L\" seems a tad to wide for my tastes, but its hard to tell without seeing it in a setting. The \"F\" is great, it seems energized. You'll need to straighten it, of course, but don't touch those curves and corners! The \"K\" looks top heavy and a little wide. The \"J\" is fine, maybe take the left serif in a hair?\n\nI'm eager to see the lowercase.\n\nI hope someone with more experience than me chimes in, too.\n\nIt's looking very, very nice, keep it up!\n\n"

It _may_ be a little too wide on top and you _may_ be overcompensating for that illusion where one line passing through another looks unaligned (I forget what it's called right now but its the reason the left leg and the right arm aren't really a straight line) **but** it is very hard to be certain of a lot of this stuff without seeing it in context and at it's optimal point size. There are more educated, experienced voices than mine who frequent these forums and I hope one of them will comment (hrant?).\n\n"
