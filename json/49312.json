  "content": "Hi,  \nIm doing a design for a website that gonna present different trips so I had the idea of present all the information as it is on those flip displays on airports. I thought maybe some dot matrix kind of font but I think I want some more mechanic look, more towards Alpha Headline. But that's too round for my taste.\n\nAnyone have any suggestion?  \nWould appreciate any input.\n\n",
