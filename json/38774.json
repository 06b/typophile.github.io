One’s called free wifi.\n\nHowever, when I click on these, it never gives me any internet connection?\n\nWhat are these for and how do they differ from normal networks?\n\n [‹ Well-written outsider article](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709011835/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38805 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Design of astronomical symbols & astrological symbols ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709011835/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38682 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It will only give you an internet connection, if the user you are connected to is connected to the internet via modem or via another network(-cable) and has enabled sharing their internet connection.\n\nDon’t know if that explainantion made any sense to you at all...  \nbut you’ll probably get a amore qualified answer asking this at some sort of mac-support forum.\n\n"
