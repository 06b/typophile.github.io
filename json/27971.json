Esto quizá puede notarse en la asimetría de la curva de la c, que en la parte inferior se vuelve mucho más abierta.  \nEsta decisión tiene base en el movimiento del isotipo de kalidoscopio.

      "content": "I like this font. With a bit tweaking here and there this will work very well.  \nHere are some of the things that caught my eye. Some might be caused by the screen, cut I'll give 'm to you anyway:\n\n- 'S' and 's' are hanging backworks. Like Hrant said they could be narrower, like your 'E'. Besides that you might wanna give it a bit of a rotation clockwise.  \n- Most important in a font IMHO are the proportions. It looks like you 'b' is wider as the 'd'. 'p' looks wider as the 'q'.  \n- Because you cut off the tail of the 'a' it look a bit smaller. By doing that you put the focus on the bowl. Perhaps you could try making the right lower side of the bowl less angled. If you open up the bowl a bit more you get more air in it and it might help balance the font again.  \n- I like it that you haven't descide whether to make a roman or an italic. Mix it baby. Some characters (A, V, W, y, x) have an italic feel to it that gives the font a swing.  \n- Perhaps you could move the accent in the 'i', it's hanging a bit to much left.  \n- Try correcting some weight problems. Some characters look like they are thicker than others. Look for the V, W, v,  \n- Who kicked that '8'? Personally I don't think you need the bent curve on the lower right bowl.  \n- Please change the mouth of the '5', I have the feeling this is a whale with an open mouth fishing for plancton. Perhaps you could bring it closer to the '3'.  \n- I don't know if the middle of the 'k' should be higher. Might be that takes the funk out and than you should leave it like it is.  \n- Although I like your accents, they might be to classical for this sans serif font. They would work very well on a serif font, but here they feel to sharp. Try getting the characteristix between the characters and the accents right.\n\nThat's it for now. My time is up.  \n®ené\n\n"

I hope you have more success than I did with it :-) Part of the problem is how the glyphs sit on the line. Tight now it seems a bit bouncy. Your s looks a bit brogen mostly in the lower curve. The most uncomfortable glyph is the \"g\". You need to really look at the outer curve as opposed to the inner curve and release that pinch between the bowls in some way.  \nKeep fighting with it.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Maybe even do a \"kill your darlings\" here :)\n\nIt steals the attention to much I believe and while all the other letters feel open and smooth round, the \"g\" is kind of like opposite. It’s good that it make the whole font personal, but maybe a little too much?\n\nSo, my suggestion would be to make the \"g\" a little bit more smooth and also maybe just a little bigger upper bowl to make it sing-a-long with the other letters that have a more open feeling to them.  \nGreat Work! I love the uppercase A with the not straight stem :)\n\n"

You might wanna make it just a little bit narrower, because the inner forms seem a tiny bit to big in comparence to the other characters. But that could be the screen resolution playing with my eyes.  \nI agree with Hrant that you should try one without an ear. It would fit to the underlaying style of the font.  \nThe new 'g' fits harmonically within the font, but it has lost its teath. It looks just very 'correct'. Nothing that you might remember. But that's perhaps the good thing with it.\n\nI don't know what else you've corrected, but in the last pdf I saw some problems with the 'v', 'w', 'x' and 'y'. They look out of tune with the rest.  \nIf you take a spin at the 'w', try using the legs 'thick-thin-thick-thin'-technique. Now your outer legs are thick and the inner thin. This looks a bit strange to me.\n\nWhy is the top of the 'f' diving back down again? Why not opening the top by making it look more like the 'r'. This seems to look up into the sky and filosophize about it's too short life. ;-)\n\nYou've curved the leg of the 'y' a bit like a wave. Have you tried this form yet?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120115034749im_/http:/typophile.com/files/y_4390.gif)\n\nThe tow of the 't' seems a bit to thick. I think it stands out a little to much. It's like a drop of ink hanging at the end there.\n\nIs that your comma in the pdf? That's much to caligraphic for your font.\n\nThe 'x' isn't doing it for me.

If you wanted to keep the ear but make it less old style you could also make the ear shorter. The old ear or no ear could work too depending on what you want the text to feel like. Actually..... you could probably do well treating the ear differently at different optical sizes. The smaller the text the more it will benefit from the diagonal ear. At Headline sizes you could have a linear ear or a modified diagonal and at very large sizes you could loose the ear altogether as statement. Or not. Just thinking out loud.\n\n"

The horizontal middle line is straight now. It might look better when this is round so it fits better to the italic character.  \n- to me, the 'z' and 'Z' don't really fit to the overall character of the font. Perhaps you just wanna make the diagonal straight?  \n- The italic 'a' is a difficult one. To the eye (at least my eye) it's to close to the 'o', therefor it makes the words harder to read. I get where you're coming from, but it might put to much strain on the eye.\n\nI see there are still little spacing problems that need to be resolved, but other than that I think it's just fine.
