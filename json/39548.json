And what better way to celebrate it than with the latest in our signature font series, Fontdinerdotcom Jazz Light and Fontdinerdotcom Jazz Dark! Both unmistakably our own inspired by our own Fontdinerdotcom Loungy font and highly caffienated with a jumpy leaky fountain pen for added effect! So load up a stack of wax on the turntable and head on over to the Vend-O-Matic for some tasty licks at: [http://www.fontdiner.com/silver.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103010314/http:/www.fontdiner.com/silver.html \"http://www.fontdiner.com/silver.html\")\n\nIf that weren’t enough to tempt you, you’ll have kittens when you see the newest commercial fonts we’ve created with our friend, talented lettering artist, illustrator, and fine art painter Sam Gambino! They’re called Blackcat and Blackcat Fever! These playful and spooky retro brush scripts were inspired by the creepy comic books of the 1950’s and they’re only available at Font Bros. Check ’em out here: [http://www.fontbros.com/sideshow.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103010314/http:/www.fontbros.com/sideshow.php \"http://www.fontbros.com/sideshow.php\")\n\nIt seems you’ve also been busy and have helped us add a bunch of great new Homemade Specialties to the Diner so check out some specialties people have created using our fonts! If you’ve created some nice stuff using our fonts, let us know, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nAll this plus plenty of news about our shiny new diner and our feature in a new book about vintage type!\n\nSee you there: [http://www.fontdiner.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103010314/http:/www.fontdiner.com/ \"http://www.fontdiner.com\")\n\nWarmly,  \nStuart :D\n\n",
