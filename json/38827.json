  "content": "Stephen King once said (I believe it was in On Writing) that he could tell a lot about a person by what books they own. There’s quite a bit of truth in this statement. I can tell a lot about people just by examining the odds and ends they keep around their home. People will usually buy things that reflect their particular tastes.\n\nAs a designer this fascinates me. Thinking about this I happened to glance at my coffee cup and an idea hit me; I should start a thread here on Typophile where everyone could share something from their own life that reflects their love of typography.\n\nFor me it has always been anything old and ornate. Last year about this time I had the opportunity to participate in a Photoshop Design contest. The challenge was to design a billboard ad for Photoshop in the past or future. I had no idea what I was going to make until I visited Leterheadfonts and spotted Tom Kennedy’s gorgeous Billhead font. Looking at the old letterhead samples he had made (to display the font) I was inspired to create an early 1900’s billboard advertising Photoshop. The challenge was to conceive of how this ad would present the program during that time period; what terminology would they use to describe the program? what pictures (if any) could I use to convey the message?\n\nIt took me about three weeks to come up with my final billboard design. Unfortunately, I did not even place in the finals, but Denise Buyers of Letterheadfonts offered to display my design in their Gallery section. I was honored. If you’re curious you can see the design there or visit it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215543/http:/photoshopcafe.com/contests/contest-5-finalists.htm) on the PhotoshopCafe design challenge page.\n\nSo began my love of old typography and a more devoted search for “old things” to display around my home, including this great old coffee mug that I found one day when me and my mom were visiting an antique shop here in town.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215543im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/coffeemug_3463.png)\n\nSo do you own anything that communicates your deep, abiding love of typography/design? Show it off here :)\n\n [‹ FONTS THAT LACK KEYBOARD LINKS](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215543/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38914 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Show us your shirt ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215543/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37083 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In other words, it means a great deal of money.\n\nThe cat on the left is an amulet which gives you money.\n\n"

I’m most familiar with his two last incarnations, characterized by his both childish and aggressive onomatopoetic works, of which this is one. The significance is perhaps better explained by Karl Nyberg, who wrote this for an exhibition at the Modern Museum in Stockholm:\n\n_His classic phrase “HÅLL TJEFTEN” (SHUT YOUR GAB!) incites revolt and represents a refusal to submit to repressive norms, both linguistic and social. A peculiar writing style is one of the most characteristic features of Eriksson’s art. By making his own dyslexia a distinctive and individual form of expression, he turns accepted values on their head. What is normally seen as a restriction becomes instead his strength._\n\nMore pictures of his work [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215543/http:/www.gallerilarsbohman.com/books.asp?art_name=Elis%20Eriksson) and the rest of the quoted text [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215543/http:/www.modernamuseet.se/v4/templates/template1.asp?lang=Eng&id=2873).\n\nLet’s just say that everytime I look at it I can feel a tiny bit subversive when everything I do is not.\n\n- _What an awesome view from that window. What kind of work do you do?_\n\nI’m a (typo)graphic designer, and as the myth goes, we must have inspiring work environments to be “creative”.\n\n"
