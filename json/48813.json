  "content": "Hey guys, I'm currently working up some mock-ups for a \"higher end\" kitchen store. They currently have a logo but are seeking to become more modernized as the area around them picked up and is starting to get \"hip\". I've tried all kinds of things and cant really come up with anything I like. I do think the words themselves are more important than any mark. The name just doesn't feel like it requires a mark. Please take a look and give me some feedback!\n\nold\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130419005216im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cook_remake_5851.gif)\n\nnew\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130419005216im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mockphile_4451.gif)\n\n",

It hurts me to see a lot of designers avoiding that stage and going directly to the machine.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nVictor\n\n"

The store brand items were in white boxes, and the name of the product was in black Helvetica. At the bottom of the box were the trademark red and blue stripes of the Pathmark brand, and then in black Helvetica the phrase \"no frills.\"\n\nUnfortunately, there's nothing very epicurean about that.\n\nPeople who like to cook are passionate about sensory experience. I should know; I like to cook. Helvetica doesn't exactly communicate gustatory passion.\n\nThat said, the oven is cute. Overall, I'm not feeling this direction, though.\n\n--  \nNick Hladek\n\n"
