  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI just started working on a new typeface. Working title is \"Inky\", not so very sure of that name in the first place. I was thinking about the ink splatters/clouds that Cephalopods eject. Some of the shapes used refer to a stylized version of ink blurps so to say.\n\nAnyway, I started with the capitals, see below. The C, G and U might still need a bit of work (or a complete rework maybe). The M and N are quite wide compared to the other letters but I'm unsure right now how to solve that. Quite pleased with how the V and W turned out - although on some points these might stand out a bit.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160024im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Inky-werk-1_6604.png)\n\nComments and suggestions most welcome!\n\n",

Would you suggest using a vertical decender (stem?) for the /Y/ instead?\n\nInteresting suggestion about the /I/ too - I found it a bit inconsistent in relation to the /J/ but at the same time there are many other letters with a top heavy stem, so it should be ok.\n\nbottom-heavy versus top-heavy /I/ (top heavy looks pretty to me)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160024im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pill_hij_6501.png)\n\nalternate /Y/ forms:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160024im_/http:/typophile.com/files/yess_yo_6181.png)\n\n"
