[I might have missed it in my quick scan of the listings.] Nick's other free fonts are scattered over the web. Anyway, If it is a font, I expect another font detective will find it for you.  \nBTW it's helpful in these cases if you give some clue as to the source of your lettering: logo, web page, advert, book cover etc. and the date produced.  \nDon\n\n"
