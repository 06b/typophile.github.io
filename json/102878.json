  "content": "Hello.\n\nI am trying to find the font used by Greek Olympic Air for their airplanes' registration.\n\nI thought DIN and Arial Monospaced would be a good start. But DIN doesn't match at all and I am not really satisfied with Arial either.\n\nDoesn't anyone here have a better idea which might be used (see attached image)?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nChristian\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017112511im_/http:/typophile.com/files/greek-reg-font_6524.png)\n\n",
