  "content": "\"I was presschecking a job in Montreal recently and discovered Gravure Choquet Inc.I have never encountered such a clean, well-maintained shop. They specialize in letterpress, embossing (sculptured and flat) and foil stamping.\n\nHi,\n\nThis was something posted by Ken Bessie several months ago ... I was wondering if he or anyone else has seen the kind of work Gravure Choquet Inc. in Montreal has done? do they print invitations? Are their results of good quality?\n\nAlso, does anyone know of a good letterpress shop in Calgary? I would need polymer plates made, not hand set type ... so I can have more control over the design. I'm in Montreal, but my clients are in Calgary ... It's my first time designing for letterpress and I'm not sure if I should physically be in the same city as the printer or whether it will be fine to have it printed somewhere else?\n\n",

We've got less snow.... ;-)\n\n"
