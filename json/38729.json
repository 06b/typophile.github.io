Try a strong slab serif and see how that feels before you go setting three different kinds of type into one or two words. You can have two faces that compliment each other, but it's not the first place you should look, IMHO.\n\n"

None of these have a very strong concept, and they seem arbitrary and random at best.\n\n<cite>I wanted to use varying typeface to represent the diversity of the area being covered.</cite>\n\nI don't think this is a good idea. Maybe try using different weights of the same typeface. I'd go with a sans serif.\n\n<cite>Don’t know if I want to spend the time developing a icon to go with it, as nothing comes to mind really.</cite>\n\nIt might be worth it, since these are all quite bland and uninteresting. A simple mark would help you out.\n\n<cite>Also the spelling of the word... Northeastender, North East Ender, North-East Ender, Northeast Ender??</cite>\n\nTalk to your client about this one. They'll probably know better than us :-)\n\n- Lex\n\n"

      "content": "Try running North vertically then East stacked on Ender just to the right. That could make a nice tidy little mark. Use all cap sans serif. Never sacrifice aesthetics for concept. That's what you are doing with the idea of mixing typefaces to speak of the diversity. Not saying you couldn't achieve both aesthetic and concept, but right now in your pursuit of this concept, you haven't acheived an acceptable aesthetic.\n\nSomething beautiful and something ugly almost always works.\n\n"
