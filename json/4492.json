  "content": "I saw Kill Bill 2 tonight and noticed during the film, a font on a set of outdoor chairs which said \"SOL\".   \n   \nThe font in particular was a beautiful circus/western blend - I undertand this would have been hand rendered, and I am unable to find an example.   \n   \nIf anybody does have any shots from this film, of this type - could you please respond.   \n   \nI would like to use the same style for a logo I am working on. Once I saw it, I knew it would be perfect.   \n   \nWhile on the subject of fonts used for circus's. Does anybody know the historical information behind the use of fonts used for circus's?   \n   \nmwah\n\n",
