      "content": "Thanks Mark & Yves, the Cochin suggestion is good, although the Berthold Le Cochin (in FontBook) looks closer than the Nicholas Cochin, although I can't find it on the web, even at Berthold. The A & N are less 'eccentric' looking, for lack of a better term. The F is a good match.   \n   \nYves, you said it had ' a typical M', but for some reason it looked really deformed and exaggerated by the serif 'wings' at the apexes (apices?) and the stroke contrasts. Perhaps the shadows made it look more distorted to me than it was.   \n   \nThe fonts mentioned in the other thread were 'classic' looks, but not very close to this.   \n   \nI'll call of the hunt with that idea from Mark.   \n   \nThanks\n\n"
