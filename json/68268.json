I was very happy that the snatched up words actually had a point to being taken away.\n\nBad: Please, please, please don't use Google images. That is stealing, even if it is only for a student project. I'm not sure exactly what images you used, but most schools have academic access for collections such as Getty and the like. If you try to use this project in your portfolio after graduation, someone might get a little irritated.\n\nI was also a little jarred by the bright color of the legal pad paper at the end.\n\nOther than that, great work!\n\n"
