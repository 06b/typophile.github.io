      "content": "Jean Paul,\n\nI think this design is very good, with a nice feel, readability and personality. Italic is also very proportional and well done. But I guess the bold is somewhat excessive – it's almost a black style. The /e/ and /a/ storeys became very closed.\n\nIt would interesting to have a medium height to expand the family.\n\nYou may improve some little points:\n\n**1.** in /j/ the vertical nodes are misaligned;  \n**2.** in /k/ the bottom leg is very heavy;  \n**3.** in /T/ inclination of the right cut is out of font's general style;  \n**4.** in /s/ and /S/ there are small vector problems (bumps, misalignments) in curves;  \n**5.** difference in strokes of /A/ and /K/ are higher than one finds in other letters (N, W, Y).\n\nGood job! Soon I also would like to hear your critique for the serif I'm developing.\n\n"

      "content": "Igor, many thanks for your comments! It's made my day.\n\nThe bold style is indeed actually a black style. Later on I'll interpolate the bold.  \nI've opened up the a and e in the black styles a bit, much better readability indeed.  \nI've also redrawn k, s and S, als much better. I'm still working on the diagonal strokes in A, K, N, W, Y and Z, I always seem to have some difficulties with them. Is there any \"easy\" way to do them?  \nThe right (and left) cut on the T is actually something that is repeated in E and F.\n\nOne question: what do you mean by point 1 (about j)? I don't see it...\n\nI'm an amateur type designer myself, so I don't know if I'll be of any use as a criticaster, nevertheless I'ld really like to see your design for the serif!\n\nI'll post another PDF when I've adjusted the diagonals in the capitals.\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry, I didn't notice the right cut at /T/ was also used in /F/ and /E/. Anyway, as this is very typical of /T/ in serifed, old style fonts, I think it becomes a bit strange to a contemporary, squarish sans. But this is subjective.\n\nI don't know an easy way to treat these diagonals – I also have dificulties to even the colour of /v/w/x/k/ strokes myself. My method is to analise how they do in other good fonts and test test test test... Hope Typophile fellows could help on this.\n\nThe /j/ is a minor issue:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415100014im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Capturar_4730.gif)\n\nProbably you did work with two pieces and the nodes of one aren't aligned to grid. Illustrator sometimes does not align a node properly. This is usual after pathfinder and reflect operations, even if the original pieces have nodes aligned to grid. It seems to be a problem with the roundness of internal measures.\n\n"

I think they're better now, though /M/ and /W/ may still be a bit too heavy to my liking. /T/, /E/ and /F/ I have adjusted (no more skewered finials).\n\nPlease check out the second PDF above.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n"

I'd see if you can push it further to make a black weight.  \nThis is all looking quite neat and tidy.  \nI think B is a bit wide compared to the other letters.  \nThe italics need a bit of correction. Slanting alone has left the A and N particularly a bit unbalanced in weight and contrast.  \nCap Y looks unbalanced somehow.\n\nHopefully I'll have time to look at this in more depth later this week.\n\n"

      "content": "Thats a really nice design. I like especially the thin connections of curves and verticals.\n\nSome things that come to my mind:\n\n- You show a lot of contrast in your diagonals for example in V, W, k, x but no (or very low) contrast in diagonals of v.  \n- Holes in R and P are okay (even if I personally dont like it) but R and P draw a lot of attention because they are the only 2 characters with those holes. I suggest to either drop those holes at all or put even more in other characters.  \n- S is to heavy compared with other capitals.\n\nGreat work with the italic and bold. How do you do them? Do you have a Multiple Master of your design?\n\n"

I'm also working on the squarish bowls of /B/, /P/ and /R/.\n\nI've drawn these characters in Illustrator (I haven't yet bought FontLab, it's on my wish list), so no Multiple Master tools used here. I've skewed the roman to make the italic, but that not really the way to do them, although it does seem to work. The bold style I've drawn from scratch, with the regular style as a template.\n\nI hope to post the updated PDF this weekend.\n\n"

      "content": "Yeah, I was also wondering if type design is somehow more appealing to males!\n\nLet me come back to this in a day or two. I think you're definitely on a good path, but will need to examine the forms more closely to give useful advice.\n\nThe proportions are getting much more harmonious. However, a quick glance tells me you still need to resolve the contrast. A and x have quite noticeable contrast whilst other glyphs are a bit less pronounced. (Compare x with e for example.)\n\nDid I say anything about the quotes/comma already? Forgive me, I'm quite picky about commas for some reason, and I think yours need to be like curved rectangles instead of tadpoles to fit nicely in this design.\n\nYour descenders look different lengths.\n\nI'll be back in a day or two... ;)\n\n"

Please check out the updated PDF above.\n\nFurthermore, I've updated /S/ (thinner) and /R/ (rounder) again. So far I've only redrawn the regular style and updated the italic, the bold style is yet to be done...\n\n"

And I guess the dot on /i/ bold is very much heavier if compared to the regular weight.\n\nWell, it seems type design is mostly a male universe. This may explain why there are so many fonts with female names (Anna, Celeste, Victoria, Christiana, Ashley, Caecilia, Carolina, Emma, Isabela, Isadora, Joanna, Korinna, Shelley, Tiffany and so on...)\n\n"

I also feel that with these new caps the relationship in stroke thickness between lc and caps is much better and gives it a much more modern feel.  \nContrast in /w/ black is still off...\n\nYour thoughts please!\n\n"

Italic k needs more compensation.  \n-Comparing the bowl of a with the spine of s, it seems a is much squarer. Could they be harmonised more?\n\nBlack:  \n-q and b of the black weight look a bit too square in comparison to the regular.  \n-Wordspace might be too narrow (or letterspace too loose)?  \n-With w, try moving the two upper counters left a couple of notches.  \n-v might be too wide/dark.  \n-I wonder if e is a bit wide.\n\n"
