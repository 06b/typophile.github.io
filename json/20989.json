I've seen both serif and sans serif versions, but the serif versions seem more widespread, at least based on online image searches.\n\nExample of serif chart:  \n [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Snellen06.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044752/http:/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Snellen06.png \"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Snellen06.png\")\n\nRockwell? Or is there something closer?\n\nAs for the sans serif versions, online images of these are harder to find. But they remind me of BankGothic Lt BT, although I'm pretty sure that's not it.\n\nExample of sans-serif chart:  \nhttp://pro.corbis.com/popup/Enlargement.aspx?mediauids={87b2fd54-3495-426c-8400-9280e50bf723}|{ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff}&qsPageNo=3&fdid=&Area=Search&TotalCount=472&CurrentPos=25&WinID={87b2fd54-3495-426c-8400-9280e50bf723}\n\n",

Judging by the vertical symmetry, lack of overshoots on the rounds (O,C), and tiny bowls (D,P) it seems clear that the slab version at least was made by scientists, doctors, or engineers -- not type designers. These are my closest matches:\n\nSerif: [Stymie Medium](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044752/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/stymie_com_medium/?sample_text=EFPTOZLD&sample_size=74) beats [Rockwell](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044752/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/rockwell_by_adobe_std_roman/?sample_text=EFPTOZLD&sample_size=74) mainly because of the width and it's shorter E,F crossbars.\n\nSans: [Sackers Heavy Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044752/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/sackers_gothic_std_heavy/?sample_text=PNXCASLGRK)\n\n"
