  "content": "I'm getting a type themed tattoo done this year, but I'm still having problems finding the right font. The idea is basically to get latin phrases tattooed around both of my calves in capital letters. It would be easy just to pick one of my current favourite serif fonts, but since this one is for life I'd like to get something a bit more lasting.  \nI think I'm looking for something very classical and timeless, along the lines of Roman capitals. The problem is that when scaled small enough to be wrapped around my leg, most fonts simply arent tall enough to look good. I did a quick test using Trajan pro, but unfortunately the letters are a bit too wide for my skinny legs.  \nSo... A good-looking, **very** classic font with \"tall\" caps and a timeless feel to it. Any ideas?\n\nIf you know a great font that might look good but doesn't match the keywords mentioned above, feel free to name it as well.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

Since tattoos tend to spread over time, I'm trying to avoid thin lines as much as possible. Thanks anyway!\n\nBasically I'm looking for a condensed version of Capitalis Monumentalis. I know this may sound like a bit of a wild goose chase, but I still like to think there's a perfect font somewhere just waiting to be found.\n\n"

It's classical but organic, and it has a special caption weight with reduced contrast.

For example: your leg's skin will remain the same size if you don't get fat.  \nI would never get a tatoo on belly :P\n\n"
