I’d like to quickly point you all to another typeface often requested on the Typophile Type Identification Board that has finally made the transition to digital. Bookman Swash — not the wimpy blandified ITC version, but “the swashy original” — is boasted by Veer to be “the most comprehensive digital revival of the original ’70s delicacy”. Although I haven’t had the opportunity to test it, Jason Walcott’s Jukebox Bookman looks like it’s the real deal. It has all the vintage traits of the original Bookman — moderate x-height, higher contrast, obliques instead of italics — and the alternates are simply swashalicious.\"_\n\nIn other words, the ITC Version is not very good. :^/\n\n"
