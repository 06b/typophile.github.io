In a previous response to this question from 2010, someone suggested: Armitage (Fontspring). Has anyone come across any other substitutes since then?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

No italics though. You could also try the two extended weights of [Trade Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310051041/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/) (regular and bold).\n\n"
