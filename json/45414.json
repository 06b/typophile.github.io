My guess is both.\n\nThe question of letter tailoring is very linked with the intended scale even if they are in many way quite different ideas.\n\n"

It is not a font, but a<br>\nhand-drawn logo. The purpose is to give it more presence on the cover. At<br>\nnineteen characters it is the one of the more complex mastheads.</cite>\n\n<cite>As we know a font’s characters are meant to all work with each other. In a<br>\nlogo where we have fixed relationships we can draw the best possible<br>\nletterform combinations.</cite>\n\n<cite>There are two ligatures in the artwork: “AR” and “RAL.” In the first<br>\nligature the leg (and angle) of the “R” is allowed to tuck nicely under the<br>\n“C.” In the second ligature the angle of the leg of the “R” has been changed<br>\nto allow the consistent spacing that has been established.</cite>\n\n<cite>There are two “C”s in the word “Architectural.” The second “C” has an<br>\nunfortunate neighbor “T”, and combined with the open space left by the “C”<br>\nit leaves more negative space than one would want in this situation.<br>\nTherefore, the ending of the “C” has been slightly extended and weight has<br>\nbeen added to that part of it to compensate for the excessive negative<br>\nspace. </cite>\n\n<cite>The last thing to mention is the bookmatched serifs in the combinations<br>\n“CT”, “ES”, and “ST.”</cite>\n\nJames, I will comment further on the Huemiller later today or the next.\n\n"
