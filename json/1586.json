I was wondering, however, if you guys can come up with Id's on these.   \n   \nTime: I have no idea what this is   \n   \nGucci: Americana is close but not it exactly, is there something obvious I'm missing?   \n   \nLe Coq Sportif: This looks like modified Franklin Gothic but I don't think that's it since the e and 'c' have horizontal lines at the end of the stroke whereas in FG they are slanted. Any ideas?   \n   \nJohnston & Murphy-I've come across fonts that look similar but none has the distinctive ampersand.   \n   \nI'm doing this for a spoof poster where I'lll need to modify the logos to read something different but similar as in Johnston and Murphy -\\> Jason and Murrray. It's non commercial project for a student organization. Any help would be greatly appreciated as always.   \n   \nLogos:   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110413112959im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18338.jpg)\n\n",
