As we say in the FAQ these hand-printed fonts are so easy and cheap to make that there is no way to ever catalog them all. The link Stephen has above ends with having your own font made -- it's that easy -- and some sites will do it for under $10. This means it's often best to pick something similar, and use it.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
