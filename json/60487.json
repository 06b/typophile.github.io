  "content": "Hey there!  \nWell, I'm new here so maybe I should introduce myself.  \nMy name's Filip Łysyszyn and I'm young _(typo)graphic designer wanna-be_ from Warsaw, Poland. I'm not a design/art student (I study english philology).  \nI've recently started working on a new typeface that I hope to be my first \"serious\" one. However, I'm still very unexperienced and I really would appreciate professionals help (that means you, guys).\n\nSo, let's get it on:  \nThe typeface name is July, probably because I started it in July.  \nIt's meant to be a roman type with rather big aperture, small contrast and strong but short sherifs.  \nThese weird acutes you see are a polish diacritics \"kreska\". These strange accents in \"a\" and \"e\" are again polish diacritics called \"ogonek\". The \"l\" with a diagonal line in the middle is a polish letter \"ł\" (lslash).  \nI haven't put it in a font file yet, because some glyphs need corrections - that's why I can't show it in a paragraph here.\n\n**Work In Progress Specimen:**  \n [http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen01.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417184903/http:/lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen01.png \"http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen01.png\")  \n [http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen02.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417184903/http:/lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen02.png \"http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen02.png\") - lowercase  \n [http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen03.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417184903/http:/lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen03.png \"http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen03.png\") - uppercase  \n [http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen04.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417184903/http:/lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen04.png \"http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen04.png\") - small caps  \n [http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen05.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417184903/http:/lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen05.png \"http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen05.png\") - ligatures\n\n**PDF PREVIEW**  \n [http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/preview.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417184903/http:/lysyszyn.pl/projects/preview.pdf \"http://lysyszyn.pl/projects/preview.pdf\")\n\nAgain, I would appreciate any help and critique!  \nYour's sincerely,  \nFilip Łysyszyn\n\nPS. If I violated any rule of etiquete around here, please forgive and let me know.\n\n",

      "content": "Nice work. This has appealing character, and I especially like the ligatures.\n\nYou should definitely move it to a font design program so you can evaluate it in more settings. Once you do that, here are some questions I would ask:  \n- Is the top of 'c', 'q' too light? 'C'?  \n- Are the lumps of 'm' too pointy? 'n'?  \n- Do the 'f's in the 'ff' ligature match well?  \n- Is the transition from thick to thin in 'S'/'s' too abrupt?  \n- Is 'N' too narrow? 'M'?  \n- Is 'J' off balance?  \n- Is the space under 'Q's tail within the bowl serving well at target sizes?  \n- Are some of the small caps too dark (for example 'M')?  \n- Should the right foot serifs of 'f' and 'r' be extended to help balance the letters?\n\nHope that helps.\n\n"
