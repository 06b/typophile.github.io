I’ve already designed all the basic letter in Inkscape but they always come out with the wrong spacing and wrong height. Also, when I try to save I always get errors on the letters which ruin the design. Can someone help me with this? I tried really hard.\n\nHere is the font I’m try to make.  \n [http://willhostforfood.com/users/M/mega\\_rock\\_exe/BN\\_Title\\_font.svg](http://web.archive.org/web/20091001030331/http:/willhostforfood.com/users/M/mega_rock_exe/BN_Title_font.svg \"http://willhostforfood.com/users/M/mega\\_rock\\_exe/BN\\_Title\\_font.svg\")\n\n",

Letters of Credit by Walter Tracy is extremely helpful, as is Cabaraga’s Learn FontLab fast. I learned a lot from Fonts & Logos by Doyald Young. Karen Cheng’s book is not a must have, though it has helpful comparisons of different fonts. The most important things are to study other fonts you admire in a font drawing program, see how they work on paper and screen, and draw, draw, draw.\n\n"
