      "content": "“Always there is a Chinese who said it earlier” Is that what the Spanish says, Hrant?\n\nIn this case, no. Chinese doesn’t have a schwa among its sounds, at least in Mandarin.\n\nThe fact is that ’schwa’ is a Hebrew word originally. My point here—relevant to your and Chris questioning the propriety of using a Biblical text—is that religious texts, including the tower of Babel story, are a part of our cultural heritage, and often they are not religious or sectarian in their connotations—such as the word ’schwa’.\n\nOur history is intertwined with the history of religions and religious texts. Type history in particular is intertwined with the printing of the the Bible, in Latin, Greek, Hebrew,and many other scripts and languages. So using the Tower of Babel passage to illustrate different scripts is beautifully apt, and not in the least sectarian or offensive.\n\n"

[This fellow](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827234827/http:/www.omniglot.com/aboutme.htm) did, and I’m sure from his bio that proselytizing was the furthest thing from his mind. He was just using the oldest familiar story on the origin of many languages to illustrate many languages. He wasn’t endorsing it.\n\nThe Tower of Babel story is only directly critical of the Babylonian religion, and that is long, long gone. As its overt target is antique in the extreme, people normally read story as a warning against arrogance, or trying to be a god yourself, or something like that. It is not particularly sectarian, and in fact at least three different religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam—claim Genesis as their own. Since this particular story doesn’t preach in favor of any sect it is inoffensive to almost everybody, including those like me who take it as myth or legend.\n\n"

Religious or not, it seems to me that modesty is a becoming garment.\n\nBeing a rationalist, as well as religious, I do not take any text as infallible authority, including any religious text. I like to think that a true religiousity, acknowleging the awesome and mysterious powers that sustain us and the universe, will engender an appropriate humility. And often this is the case. Unfortunately, some religious people have interpreted and still do interpret their texts as infallible instructions to persecute others. However, the abuses by some religious people is not a reason to censor and banish religious references from public discourse.\n\n"

Outside of one’s  \nlittle village, it’s plain ugly.\n\nThere are at least three things wrong with this argument.\n\nFirst, you are reacting as if the author of the web site is proselytizing for religion, or that any quote of a religious text has to be for the purpose of proselytizing, which is just ridiculous. Many people, including myself, quote religious texts from many religions as well as anti-religious texts, to make points clear and not endorse the views.\n\nSecond, as you repeatedly ignore, but is fact, this text is not of one specific religion, but of at least three. Those familiar with this text as a result of being raised in societies with widespread Judaism, Christianity or Islam constitute not a little village but over half of humanity. And if you focus on those peoples who use alphabetic texts—the point of the exercise—it is probably three-quarters of this group. As an English language site, practically everyone will be familiar with the story.\n\nFinally, your dark hints about ’one religion’ and ’little village’ seem to allude to the fact that this is from the Hebrew Bible, and hence Jewish. The idea that this guy has the purpose of proselytizing for Judaism—and I doubt he is Jewish—is laughable. What is “just plain ugly” are your dark hints that quoting anything Jewish is offensive.\n\n"
