In applications like Indesign and Illustrator CS, I get random results were some of the fonts are avaiable and some aren’t.\n\nI have also followed the tutorial at  \n [http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mvie...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060058/http:/groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2843 \"http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mview=0&ID\\_Message=2843\")  \nwhich again gets random results.\n\nI’m using OSX with FL 4.5 and Siutcase X1 to activate the fonts.  \nCould someone please help with an expalination or tutorial.\n\nMuch appreicated.\n\nc.\n\n [‹ Greek Kerning Files?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060058/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27690 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Adobe Acrobat Pro 7.0 Font problems - HELP! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060058/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21264 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Before procuring the services of a shaman to undo your curse, maybe look into the possibility that FontLab 4.5 has some kind of bug. I started using FontLab at version 5 under Windows, so it’s not at all impossible that the exact same thing that works on my machine doesn’t on yours.\n\n"
