I guess you are referring to an able designer getting the job that normally someone’s cousin (at least here in Spain) usually would “handle.” I’d think her school would rock if it had anything as cool as this in the corridors.\n\nI like the idea that the children will be able to produce their own branded items straight out of their old PC’s. And they may even get to think about tracking/kerning when trying to emulate the items they’ve seen on the walls?\n\n"

      "content": "Branding is... Well, cattle get branded. it kind of creeps me out to see to too slick a branding job on a school... Although this one is nicely executed, subtle and not so in-your-face.\n\nAll schools _I’ve_ ever seen are branded. Some (a few) professionally. Some by students, some by school board members’ cousins. Often team mascots are involved. (go team go!)\n\nI think I prefer the variety where the kids have had some input.\n\nThe fact that it is Arial just goes to show we can all get a little too bent out of shape over typefaces. Sure I hate Arial, but like any other typeface, it has a purpose and can be used effectively. (Besides, every typeface is somebody’s baby... )\n\n.-=®=-\n\n"
