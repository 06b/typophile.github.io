The client has asked for a display face in a ’50s ‘retro’ style accustomed with the stereotyped American diner, gas station etc.\n\nThe first port of call was, of course, FontDiner.\n\nHowever, fifties retro is not really a favourite genre of mine, so has anyone got their own preferred 50’s font?\n\nAny suggestions welcomed!  \nThanks in advance.\n\n( [MVB Bossa Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20060414084638/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=MVB.102372.0.0) is a start!)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [LOGO.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060414084638/http:/typophile.com/files/LOGO.jpg) | 38.71 KB |\n\n",
