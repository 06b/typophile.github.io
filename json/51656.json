I'm still on the drawing board on this one, just wanted to know if you guys like the direction or think I should abandoned ship.

      "content": "The type looks decent, but I feel that the mark is too generic. To me it communicates nothing, and the closest I get to a meaning is 'community', but that's because shapes in a circle make me think of Ubuntu.\n\nDo you have any other graphic ideas? I'd love to see some other ideas explored.\n\nWhat is your strategy? What 2 or 3 words are you trying to communicate with the logo (knowing that let me see how well you're achieving your goal when I see it)\n\nEither way, best of luck, keep going at it!\n\n"

      "content": "what i see is that you could take the glyph you have and move towards turning it into an abstract object representing something from childhood - I see a jack in your object.\n\nIf it was to be a community concept - then consider moving away from symmetry and see if the elements when overlapping make a more unified form. just don't use four overlapping hands... ;)\n\nRemember A good logo Identity mark should also make sense when sent with a fax machine... also the use of color should not be the only source of unity between the glyph and the text elements. . . Mimic the fonts style in the glyph exaggerate a character in the name to be the repeating element in the glyph...\n\nYou will find that if you have at least three elements that unify the two parts of the logo you will have a solid design that your client would be proud to pay you for.\n\njust my thoughts . . .\n\n"
