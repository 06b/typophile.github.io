  "content": "I will be in New York this week and want to browse typography books and perhaps some on graphic design. I used to enjoy Barnes and Noble at 6th and 22nd where they had a better than average collection of books on typography. It has since closed, and according to B&N, none of the stores has picked up the typography specialty.\n\nSearched the Typophile site but to now avail. Any suggestions for favorite places to browse new books on these topics would be appreciated.\n\n [‹ LCD or CTR monitors?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704194357/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45278 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Bitmap imagery in photoshop - how do you get the circles perfectly round? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704194357/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45160 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
