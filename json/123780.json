  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI made this piece of lettering, and I need a typeface pairing for the captions. I've been using Bodoni MT Black for its rational construction and stroke contrast, but my boss thinks it's too high-contrast, and also wants me to try some lowercase.\n\nAny suggestions? Note that this will be 21\" wide.\n\n[![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145207im_/http:/i.imgur.com/QCTvqJJ.png)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145207/http:/imgur.com/QCTvqJJ)\n\n",

I don't know how I skipped over Clarendon — somehow I tried Century and didn't make that jump to Clarendon.\n\nErasmus has a nice optimistic stoicism to it with the angled terminals.\n\nBookman always feels like the 70s to me, but maybe that's just the outsize influence of the ITC version.\n\nGlobe Gothic is a good thought, but I dunno, the digitized version looks so...digital.\n\nAnyway, thanks for all the help, y'all! We're hoping to send this thing into production next week and you've helped me get there. Look for it soon in your local purveyor of smart, funny gifts for smart, funny people.\n\n"
