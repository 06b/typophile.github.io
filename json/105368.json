The font is is not commercially available.  \n [http://uomarketing.com/pdf/Athletics\\_Grahpics\\_Guide.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063129/http:/uomarketing.com/pdf/Athletics_Grahpics_Guide.pdf \"http://uomarketing.com/pdf/Athletics\\_Grahpics\\_Guide.pdf\")\n\nAccording to one of the databases I ran the sample through, the typeface is an 88% match to Akzidenz Grotesk, so I suspect the folks at Nike—who designed the font, whose official name is OregonUniversity (no space)—may have used one of the official university typefaces as their starting point.\n\nTo recreate the look, Ryuk's suggestions above are a good starting point. You could also mix and match Akzidenz Grotesk with the N and parts of the E from House Industries Girard Sky Upright:  \n [http://www.houseind.com/fonts/girardfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063129/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/girardfonts \"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/girardfonts\")\n\n"
