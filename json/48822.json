  "content": "Hey guys, I need a scalable vector of the dot pattern seen behind the bald eagle on The Great Seal of the United States on the back of a one dollar bill. Anyone know where I can get a vector halftone dot pattern like this... preferably for free, if possible? Here are some examples of what I'm looking for:\n\n[http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20Government/Federal%20Reserve...](http://web.archive.org/web/20100709214126/http:/www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20Government/Federal%20Reserve%20Scam/Eagle.jpg \"http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20Government/Federal%20Reserve%20Scam/Eagle.jpg\")\n\n[http://www.tobi.com/color\\_image/men\\_side\\_image/11795](http://web.archive.org/web/20100709214126/http:/www.tobi.com/color_image/men_side_image/11795 \"http://www.tobi.com/color\\_image/men\\_side\\_image/11795\")\n\nAgain, I need a scalable vector of the halftone dot pattern, not the actual Great Seal. Thanks.\n\n",

Then repeat the process on a different angle.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n"
