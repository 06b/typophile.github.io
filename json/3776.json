I do not exactly understand how it will actually be used?   \nDoes it require the typographer/designer to change the font   \nversion each time there is a change in voice, etc.or is there   \nsome sort of software/technical interface-ie a software translation from dictation to written word. Please elaborate.   \n   \nAs far as forms- They do not flow together as is. The incision   \non certain glyphs look out of place to me. These are marked in orange.

I am more interested right now in the appearance than the programming issues that are involved, however. I plan on presenting it as a Flash movie where you hear different voices reading text and see a simulation of the letterforms appearing (as if they were being typed or recognized on the fly.)   \n   \nUppercase is in progress but the semester is closing in on me fast...   \n   \nI really like the incised letters, perhaps I should just try to make it a more consistent application by introducing it to other letters like the h, n, etc.?   \n   \nThanks for the Emigre tip, I'll check that out.\n\n"

You could say that Amplitude is proportional to apparent size, and that depends on point size, yes, but also weight and x-height propotion - like how ITC Garamond is much \"louder\" than let's say Simoncini Garamond (at the same point size).   \n   \nInflection/stress: Tough one.   \nItalics might seem natural, but I would caution against it, since:   \n1) Slant introduces Speed.   \n2) Cursiveness introduces informality/friendliness.   \n   \nI think Stress might be best marked with stroke contrast.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Should the bolder ones also have a verticle emphasis, with more weight on the bottom?   \n   \nOh, and I can attest to her being more than halfway to being a type designer, if the other half is bullheadedness (in the most positive way)!   \n   \nAaron\n\n"
