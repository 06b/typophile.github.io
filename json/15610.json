It includes more weights and styles, making the classic type family more consistant.\n\nHelvetica is still one of the most widley used typefaces of all time; although it is loved by many, it is hated by some. There is no shortage of commentary on the typeface, and there has even been a book published by [Lars Muller Publishers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101081409/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lars%20Muller%20Publishers) entitled \"Helvetica: Homage to a Typeface\" dedicated to the famous type family.\n\n[Linotype's website](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101081409/http:/www.linotype.com/) includes an overview of all of the [original Helvetica font](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101081409/http:/www.linotype.com/526/helvetica-family.html) weights, and all of the [Neue Helvetica font](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101081409/http:/www.linotype.com/1266/neuehelvetica-family.html) weights as well.\n\n",
