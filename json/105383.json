I like how clean it is, yes it's a little different than the san serifs usually floating around.  \nAny help would be super appreciated!  \nThanks so much!  \nJenn\n\nps- this is my second (?) time here so if there is forum edict I'm missing, I'm really sorry!  \npps- sorry I can't give more helpful thoughts on the typeface in question!\n\n",
