  "content": "dear typophiles\n\nthis morning i got access to the library of the new school i started studying. i already ordered some books and magazines (reproduction of frutigers woodcuts, for example) but am mainly looking for samples of early grotesques. with early i mean everything from royal grotesk (if there is any sample of that in any book) over scheltersche grotesk to akzidenz grotesk, including american grotesques like franklin gothic.\n\ni can also get typographische monatsblätter and similar magazines, but only in yearbooks, so i'd need to know year and month if you know any interesting editions of those.\n\nunfortunately they dont have too many type specimens, so im trying to find books to find samples. im working on my own grotesque design (fun only) in which i mix \"the european and american models\" a little bit (inclundg a two story g for example). plus you all got me infected with typophilis ;)\n\nif im already at it, another question: does anybody here know what \"Spécimen général tome\" is? they have four books of it, nr. 2 being sansserif and slabserif designs, i'll get that one anyway but maybe you know if they're interesting enough to also get the three other volumes.\n\nsorry for the lengthy post.. i hope someone will answer!\n\n",
