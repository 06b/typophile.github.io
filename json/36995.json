  "content": "Hello\n\nI would like to know what you think are the advantages to the client, when they have a typeface designed exclusively for them?\n\nNow I know that they will recieve something unique out of this, but is it actually a worthwhile investment. Is there any proof that it sells products?\n\nA few brands I have looked at...\n\nCoca Cola - #1 Brand in the world of course uses a unique script logo, scribe by the original maker’s bookeeper. This is obviously very unique and is a key element to their packaging.\n\nGE - uses GE Inspira on all their branding and marketing and even in house word processing.\n\nWhat do you all think about this subject?\n\nThanks\n\nTom\n\n [‹ Could someone identify this font, please?

      "content": "Well, one advantage of having a corporate typeface is that your “look” cannot be duplicated. For a long time (perhaps still) Apple’s look was Garamond Condensed for body copy. Many others were able to make their ads “look like Apple’s” by using the same fonts and general layout. Had Apple chosen a corporate face, then copy cats could not have been quite so close in their attempts to steal Apple’s image.\n\n"

      "content": "If a large corporation has its own custom font it can actually work out cheaper for them than paying huge licence fees for thousands of users. Plus the fact that the font/family is unique to them, and presents a cohesive image (if used within a corporate guideline) to the outside world.\n\nI don’t know if this ever results in an increase in sales, it depends on the type of company. But it can certainly make a company more ’identifiable’ to the public, even if it’s only subliminally, (which, is the case in the majority of the type-unaware).\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

That was cutom designed by David Quay and Freda Sack for Wolff Olins I think. It certainly stood out when it was first introduced, and has had a fair few imitators since, though it may be starting to look a bit dated now.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

It is indeed the typeface that could be used as a case study why to have a corporate font.\n\nNatWest have, actually, sold off the rights to the semi serif version, the display stuff that was so recognisable, to Typhoo (tea brand). Unfortunately, it does not translate well into that environment. Someone also started messing about with the design, changing some characters and it looks - well, how can I describe it - shit!\n\nNatWest now only use the Sans version which was created initially for text use only.\n\nBruno Maag\n\n"
