  "content": "Found these letters in \"Philadelphia\" on the title page of an old book. The page was printed in one color letterpress.\n\nThe letterforms reminded me of some that I saw in Hill's Manual of Business Forms. There are 2 versions of what Thos Hill called \"Brush Letters\". I've included them for reference in case it helps, but I'm really looking for the name of the typeface used to print this word \"Philadelphia\"\n\nAny help or leads of any kind are welcome and appreciated.\n\nAll my best,  \n–Nic\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225953im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Philadelphia_6546.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225953im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-06-18%20at%2011_6722.47.40%20AM.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225953im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-06-18%20at%2011_5460.47.54%20AM.png)\n\n",
