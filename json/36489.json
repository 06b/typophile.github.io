The closest I've found is Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk Extra Bold, which is extremely close, but this logo is just a little more squared off.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010075359im_/http:/typophile.com/files/topcheflogo_4852.jpg)\n\n(had trouble attaching the file, so I just included the image)\n\n",

      "content": "I had tried that along with regular BE Extra Bold, and the two of those looked practically identical to me. (I laid them over the logo to compare.) It just seems like both of those have larger corner radii, for lack of a better term, than the logo has. Where you really see it is in the bowl of the P. It seems odd to me how flat that is in the logo, whereas the tops of the O and C don't really flatten out at all.\n\n"

I've had \"Behind the Typeface: Apple Garamond\" in mind for some time. First Apple squeezed her into a size 0, then they squeezed her out when they were done with her. Just like with Hollywood actresses, body weight and \"typefaces of a certain age\" are issues in the world of corporate typography. I look forward to doing this hard-hitting investigative piece someday...\n\n"
