  "content": "[Typographer.org](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Typographer.org) produced a keepsake booklet for [TypeCon2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20061126102033/http:/www.typecon.com/), featuring exclusive pre-release reviews of 11 typefaces. Each of those are designed with the actual typefaces, so you see the fonts in use as you read the reviews. The signed and numbered collector’s items — produced in a limited edition of 200 copies, with a cover designed and silk-screened by hand by David — were distributed at the conference.\n\n_ **Update** All the remaining copies have found a new home. Thank you all for your support._\n\nWe’ve got good news for anyone who couldn’t attend TypeCon2005 but still wants one of those booklets.
