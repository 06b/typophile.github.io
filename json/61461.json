There are several fonts that are reasonably plausible matches for the ANNUIT COEPTIS font, namely the free United States font and the commercial LHF Bank Note and LTR Federal. But I'm stuck on the NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM part!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130811154930im_/http:/typophile.com/files/NOS_4912.jpg)\n\nIt's frustrating because it really doesn't look that extreme, yet I'm having a hard time even getting into the ballpark. The closest match I've found so far is URW++ Stencil Solid, but that has stick-outy serifs, and the contrast between thick and thin strokes is too great. There's also a vague suggestion of ITC Bookman, but Bookman is more stylized.\n\nI'm sure the actual engraving isn't based on a standard font, but I'd like to at least get closer. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",
