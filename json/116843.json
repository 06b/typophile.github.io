  "content": "Hi everyone  \nI hope someone can give me a little guidance. After combing through the forum for serif combinations with Avenir, I thought I would try a direct request. I am about to embark on the design of a range of reports for a Europrean rail transportation organisation. The reports will be of varying length, the biggest being about 140 (roughly A4) pages long. The reports themselves will be combining full colour imagery, pull out case studies, maps and various charts and graphs. It's a pretty large undertaking all in all and I really want to do a good job.\n\nThe organisation makes use of Avenir as their primary face, although I'm actually leaning towards using Avenir Next as it seems to offer more flexibility. However, I'd really like to find a nice serif to pair it with.\n\nWhat does everyone think of using Avenir Next for body copy? Would it be too tiring on the eye? And what do you think would be a nice serif for body instead? I really like Freight serif/ micro - would these work at all? Avenir Next would most likely be used for major headings to keep in line with the overall brand, if that makes any difference.\n\nTo be honest I'm having a bit of an attack of nerves so any advice would be SO appreciated!\n\n",
