I know I could do a screen capture, but that wouldn't allow me to plunk it into my style guide as editable text.\n\nI'm lazy! I don't want to type it all out. But I would like to document it so that future users are not required to enter the file to find out the style info.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated,  \nK.\n\n",

Assign each of your styles to one of these blank paragraphs. Choose File &gt; Export and choose RTF as the file format. Open the text file in Word and choose File &gt; Print. In the Print dialog box, choose Styles from the Print What pop-up menu.</cite>\n\n"
