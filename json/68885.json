  "content": "I am happy to announce Dezen, my new release!\n\nDezen is a contemporary, mechanical grotesque typeface. Its letters were first constructed from individual modules and then optically refined to enhance its rhythm. Its tight letter spacing and narrow proportions make the typeface particularly well suited for display sizes and headlines. When you add spacing, font can be used for shorter amount of text, bigger than 12 points.\n\nThe Dezen type family consists of a wide variety of styles – solid and stencil. The Dezen Pro subfamily combines all 4 styles (Solid, Stencil 01, Stencil 02, Stencil 03) in a specific sequence, which originates a “pattern” for the alphabet (or dezen, in Slovak).\n\nDezen Pro Regular is for free!\n\nBuying information:  \n [http://dizajndesign.sk/index.php?category=&page=fonts\\_dezen\\_buy](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817114019/http:/dizajndesign.sk/index.php?category=&page=fonts_dezen_buy \"http://dizajndesign.sk/index.php?category=&page=fonts\\_dezen\\_buy\")\n\nDezen pdf specimen:  \n [http://dizajndesign.sk/subory/fonts/dezen/Dezen\\_specimen.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817114019/http:/dizajndesign.sk/subory/fonts/dezen/Dezen_specimen.pdf \"http://dizajndesign.sk/subory/fonts/dezen/Dezen\\_specimen.pdf\")\n\nEnjoy!  \nJan Filipek\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817114019im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dezen-590_4106.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817114019im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dezen-590-styles_6595.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817114019im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dezen-590-weights_6657.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Dezen-590.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817114019/http:/typophile.com/files/Dezen-590_0.png) | 83.6 KB |\n\n",
