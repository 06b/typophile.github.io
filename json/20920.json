The problem is that although the weights contain the special swashes, ligatures and other goodies I love, I have no access to them when I select \"insert symbol.\" Seems a generic character map shows up. Same thing for the TrueType flavour.\n\nHow can I access these special sets through Word 2004 for Mac?\n\n",

I don't think you'll be able to get any character into Word unless it has an [Unicode](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211558/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Unicode) value associated with it.\n\n\\> _Or zhould I be using something other than Word for my Word Processing/design needs?

A simple word processing application is fine for office-like documents, but not for heavy-graphical documents that need to be offset printed.\n\n\\> _I’m really disappointed._\n\n(As sorry as I am to have to say this in mid-2006,) Welcome to the _real_ (type) world !! :^/  \nI completely understand your grief.\n\n\\*more about the development of this issue here:  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/05/eliminate\\_priva.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211558/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/05/eliminate_priva.html \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/05/eliminate\\_priva.html\")\n\n"

If so,  \n\\> wouldn’t Latin OTL support come  \n\\> for free? If so, what I fail to  \n\\> understand is why isn’t that in  \n\\> place already.\n\nFirst, there is the problem of user interface. The linguistic OTL features usually are supposed to \"just work\" while for user-controlled OTL features you need decent UI. If you look at Adobe's inconsistent solutions between Illustrator (OpenType, Character and Glyph palettes), InDesign (Character and Glyph palette but no OpenType palette), and Photoshop (only Character palette), you'll realize that it's not at all trivial.\n\nSecond, there is the issue of backwards-compatibility in line-breaking. For Arabic or Indic scripts, there was constant improvement across Office versions (97, 2000, XP, 2003, 2007) which, however, often resulted in text reflow when you open the same document in different editors. In this case, the advantage of having ortographically more correct handling of the scripts was valued higher than the disadvantage of reflow.\n\nBut for simple scripts, the Office team aimed for consistent line- and page-breaks in Word across versions. If at some point, you get ligatures and different kerning (GPOS-sourced class kerning vs. traditional plain kerning which usually is a subset of the earlier), your documents will certainly reflow. Apparently, the advantage of having typographic refinement has not yet outweighed the reflow risk in the Microsoft Office team members' heads.\n\nA.\n\n"
