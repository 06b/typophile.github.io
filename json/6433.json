So, if you want to see one of the higher expressions of lettering and dustjacket design, just get it.   \n   \n  \n [http://www.010publishers.nl/cataloque/design.php?id=435&page=1](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224917/http:/www.010publishers.nl/cataloque/design.php?id=435&page=1)   \n   \nCheers.\n\n",

      "content": "I bought this book last month, at Nijhof & Lee in Amsterdam, and agree that it is very fine. I'd never heard of Salden before, but his work is excellent: the more remarkable for the difficult circumstances of his life. He fled Germany in the 1930s, but was captured and sent to a labour camp after the German occupation of The Netherlands. He survived and, after the war, returned to The Netherlands where he did some of the best book jacket lettering I've seen. But I think the best gems are his calligraphic monograms: so perfectly balanced.\n\n"
