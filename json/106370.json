  "content": "We are getting a logo redesigned, and when we asked the designer what font he used, he said \"Untitled Regular\" and attached a font file with nothing in it. This should have been a warning.\n\nI got him to send a screenshot of the font page, and have attached that, but I have already tried Identifont, WhatTheFont, and any other font things I could find.\n\nAfter going through Identifont's \"similar fonts\", I have gotten this far:  \nIt is not Camphor, but that's the closest I could find - the numbers are all wrong, and I think the font is thinner than Camphor.  \nIt is not Frutiger Next - the j is rounder, the dots are round not square, the N might be wider, and the numbers don't match.  \nIt is not Motiva - the ends of the C's are flat, not angled, and the numbers don't match.  \nIt is not Proxima Nova - the numbers again, and also the shape of the lowercase a.\n\nStumped. Stumped stumped stumped. If we get no answer, I am not sure what to do - request a different font on the logo? I am 98% sure the designer does not know what font it is. But we like the logo in the end.\n\nTHANK YOU!  \nSheri Cheng (new member and font-o-phile)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022257im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Mystery%20Font-1379442415_5681.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Segoe WP Light/Segoe UI Light v.5.27 \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Bendy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419022257/http:/typophile.com/user/20652 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
