However my tutor suggested I use a programme to create 3D maps and layouts of areas for exhibitons, thing is I suggested CAD (I’ve never used it so I know I’m being quite dim but I know its used for 3D mapping) she suggested another programme but for the life of me I can’t remember what it was.\n\nSo can any one suggest a programme that would be relevant to mapping space for a mac?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nBec x\n\n",
