You best chance is probably to directly contact the designer(s) behind this video and ask them.  \nIf you need alternatives, some previous related discussions: [http://typophile.com/node/100787](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022054747/http:/typophile.com/node/100787 \"http://typophile.com/node/100787\"), [http://typophile.com/node/100237](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022054747/http:/typophile.com/node/100237 \"http://typophile.com/node/100237\"), [http://typophile.com/node/98172](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022054747/http:/typophile.com/node/98172 \"http://typophile.com/node/98172\"), [http://typophile.com/node/94940](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022054747/http:/typophile.com/node/94940 \"http://typophile.com/node/94940\")  \nUnfortunately, don't know this one.
