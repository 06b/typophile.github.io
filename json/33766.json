Greta Text consists of four primary text weights (each with three grades) and is optimized for use at small sizes. Greta Display was designed with increased contrast, tighter spacing and more refined details and is ideally suited for headline typography and nameplates. Greta received Type Directors Club Certificate of Excellence in Type Design, in 2007.  \n [http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta\\_text/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195554/http:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text/ \"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta\\_text/\") -  \n [http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta\\_display/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195554/http:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_display/ \"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta\\_display/\") -  \nOr download PDF presentation  \n [http://typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/GretaTextStd.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195554/http:/typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/GretaTextStd.pdf \"http://typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/GretaTextStd.pdf\") -  \n [http://typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/GretaDisplayStd.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195554/http:/typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/GretaDisplayStd.pdf \"http://typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/GretaDisplayStd.pdf\") -\n\n\\> Dutch Sky t-shirt  \nWith a great deal of irony, Johanna Bilak created a second in the series of sky t-shirts. For those not so wonderful days we now offer ‘Dutch Sky’. Or pair it with the blue original Sky t-shirt, to cover all weather possibilities. Cool grey American Apparel shirt fits on virtually any body type.  \n [http://typotheque.com/tshirts/dutch\\_sky/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195554/http:/typotheque.com/tshirts/dutch_sky/ \"http://typotheque.com/tshirts/dutch\\_sky/\") -  \n [http://typotheque.com/tshirts/sky/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195554/http:/typotheque.com/tshirts/sky/ \"http://typotheque.com/tshirts/sky/\") -\n\n\\> Edward Wright: readings, writings  \nThis book is a reader on the work of Edward Wright, English typographer, painter and teacher. It brings back into circulation some forgotten texts written about Edward Wright by contemporaries – collaborators, students, critics, as well as his own writings.  \n [http://typotheque.com/books/edward\\_wright\\_readings\\_writings/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195554/http:/typotheque.com/books/edward_wright_readings_writings/ \"http://typotheque.com/books/edward\\_wright\\_readings\\_writings/\")\n\nWarm regards,  \nPeter & Johanna  \n [http://www.typotheque.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195554/http:/www.typotheque.com/ \"http://www.typotheque.com\")\n\n",
