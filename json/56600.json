  "content": "Hi I've been asked to create a large panel in Illustrator, 118\" wide x 88\" tall. I need to leave about an 8 - 10 inch bleed on the ends (sides).\n\n(I've never done any sort of print design, so please forgive me for the questions)\n\nHow do I set this up in Illustrator so that I don't design in the bleed space? Is this something I just measure out myself? When I am finished with the design do I save it as a .eps file?\n\nLastly, how do I find out what the PMS colors are in my design?\n\nThanks for the help, I appreciate it!!\n\n",

      "content": "hi KC,\n\nSome of your design should go in the bleed space - that's what bleed  \nspace is for.\n\nPMS colors are spot colors - e.g. if you want some words in a certain  \norange, you can specify a particular Pantone orange for those.\n\nWith regard to how you should save the file (as well as color questions),  \nyou should communicate with the printer who will print the panel.\n\nhope that helps a bit.\n\n"
