I am only at sans serif condensed, likely 1920's or a bit earlier.  \nThanks so much  \nHeather \n",

A typeface then would merely be used for printing, practically all signs for instance would be hand-lettered. This logo was probably imput manually into the punch card for the Saurer machine (or whatever specific solution was used) and is not based on any specific typeface.\n\n"
