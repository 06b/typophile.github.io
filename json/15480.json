However, continued sales of PS Type 1 libraries may subsequently act as a disincentive to people or foundries developing OpenType fonts, and that may mean it's taking longer to become the next established standard.\n\n"

(Not to name names, but Extensis is dropping the ball, IMHO.

I personally think that charging extra for multiple formats is a crock, and a disservice to the market at large. Andreas gave a wink to this issue as well.\n\nTiffany: It's no hair off my back to generate three or even four different formats of a typeface. Bless the magic of software. Sure, there are some things that you can do differently across the TTF/PS divide (hinting and point placement), but again... FontLab automates all of this. How many fontmakers take the time for this in the first place?\n\nThe real matter is that the entire computer industry is becoming more and more cross-platform friendly. HP iPods?

Why leave it to third parties to potentially muck up a font file with an automated, unauthorized process? Why create the market for these third parties? Why not educate the user and keep them close to your heart (and merchant account) with a nice, cozy hug... a cross-platform hug?\n\nThe majority of font users know what's up. I'm talking about the design community. (What design school grad hasn't made a font these days?) The majority of users know how to piddle with Fontographer. The rest have a third party font converter. They are also the ones that will take their commission expenses elsewhere when you're not on the level.\n\nIt's one thing to fleece the unwitting for another 50% of the font price (such is business), but it's clearly another to perpetuate an outmoded practice and thereby stagnate the technology and our industry. I'm not making qualifications, but if we're treating everyone like luddites, the informed will maintain their disdain for what amounts to price gouging.

This means that apps written specifically for Avalon will not support Type 1 fonts. Apps that still use the older GDI engine will continue to support Type 1 fonts. That, at least, is my understanding of the current state of play.\n\nAt Tiro, we now have a policy of not making Type 1 fonts even if clients request them, and have turned down work on this basis. The main reason for this is the lack of QA tools for testing Type 1 fonts, and I don't like to ship software that I can't see inside. Compare the validation, comparison and testing tools for TT and CFF OpenType freely available from Microsoft and Adobe, and font table editing tools like TTX, to the kind of blindness in which we had to work on Type 1 fonts, just trusting that tools like Fontographer and FontLab were getting everything right. We wasted too many hours of our lives trying to simply identify bugs in Type 1 fonts, let alone trying to fix them.\n\nThe last time we shipped Type 1 fonts, one key output device in our client's print production workflow substituted incorrect characters, despite all other proofing devices handling the font correctly. How do you fix a problem like that? How can you assure the client that the font is made to spec when there are no validation tools to ensure conformance? Learning to interpret raw PS code didn't seem like a good use of a type designer's time.\n\nType 1 fonts? I spit on this arsewipe, ill-documented format. Good riddance.\n\n"

Although Windows Vista includes the PS raterizer and offers exactly the same Type 1 support as Windows XP, the next generation development platform, Avalon, is a total re-write and does not support Type 1 currently and we have no plans to add support for it.

OT fonts usually use class-based kerning. In order for kerning to work in, say, Quark 6, the OS has to create a table of kerning pairs derived from the class-based kerning. There is a limit to how big such a table can be. Class-based kerning can be the equivalent of thousands or even tens of thousands of kerning pairs, much higher than the limit in many cases.

Of course Adobe then bundled its Garamond free with InD so I was out the original cost and had a font which I never was able to use. The new super-duper All-Pro version of Garamond is a fine piece of work and comes with CS2 if you choose it. The only problems I have with OTF fonts now is with Microsoft products. That is probably because most word processing users are not as picky about type as I am. I understand Microsoft (as usual) is fixing all this in their next rev.

The difference is that in conversion, some fonts have been merged. Thus the OpenType version has a lower apparent \"font count.\" But you're not missing anything that you had in Type 1. (There were about 30 fonts we didn't have the rights to convert, and those are still present in Type 1 format.)\n\nNow, the one caveat is that if you are using old-fashioned software like QuarkXPress (prior to version 7) or Word, then you won't be able to access the extended typographic goodies in the new OpenType fonts, so functionally you can get at less stuff.
