I patiently searched and replaced the double word spaces with single word spaces when importing text into a page layout program.  \nThat was years ago. Now, the workforce is well-stocked with men and women who have never touched a typewriter, maybe never even seen one except in the movies. They don't know what monospaced letters are, or why such things existed. And yet . . . _they type two word spaces after a period._ It's as if they were reflexively waving their left hands at the end of every line to push a phantom carriage return (if you don't know what that is, [click here](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720114403/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp2IJIk5qvc)).  \nDo any of you notice this? Can any of you (especially those under 35) tell me how this archaic habit survived into the 21st Century?\n\n",

The double space helps me quickly (and unobtrusively) find each sentence in a paragraph, but isn't so much that it makes wide gaps.

But most young students, even today, are taught by their teachers to double the word space--as if the period and following capital letter weren't a sure enough sign.\n\nBut the doublespace is not just a typewriter thing. I've seen it in a number of older books. Many of my philosophy books have a larger sentence space. But if you'll notice, most books set on composition machines seem to have a wider average word space then texts set on computers. Modern texts seem to have a word space of about 6- to 4-to-em spaces, while it is not uncommon to see 3-to-em and wider on the older books. I find that this gappy word spacing actually makes the wider sentence spaces seem _less_ noticeable, since the ratio of normal to wide appears less than with the tighter spacing.\n\nI suppose if you thought it were important to make the beginnings of a sentence visibly obvious when scanning the page--I can't think of a situation in which this would be important--then you might want to keep that second space. But if the document is something which lends itself to continuous reading, such as a novel, I'm not sure that one could defend it except by appeal to subjective preference.\n\n"

That's 4 to 7 units of space, using an 18-unit em. Anyway, we got a literary journal to set. My now-wife was in charge of design and production, and agreed to a simple test. I set an article using 4-5-7 spacing, and reset it, using 5-6-8 spacing. The design people at the press were asked which they preferred; all of them preferred the 4-5-7. Then the editorial people were asked which they preferred.

When using monospaced typewriters, or monospaced fonts that imitate them.\n\nBecause of the big space around a period, and the following cap, one word space between sentences still gives plenty of space to distinguish it from a normal word space. You could argue for slightly more, I suppose, but I just can't see a full extra word space as defensible.\n\nThere is such unanimity on this, at least in English, and has such a force of logic behind it--you put unnecessarily big holes in the text--that I think to double word space after sentences at this point in time is a blunder to be avoided.

Theory & practice, I suppose, but the world is better when the two are close to each other.\n\nAs for not using a space between initials: Quick, how many of you kern the period after a W, T, V, etc.? Most everybody. And a number of fonts I've seen have the period kerned so tightly the advance after the period places the next character closer to a \"W+period\" sequence than to a plain \"W\". Now, how many of you also kern a period going \\*into\\* W, V, T, etc? Not as many, but some.\n\nAll right, with such kerning, set \"T.T.\", \"T.W.\" \"W.W.\" etc. and watch things overlap.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI too tried using the thin space between initials, and about the 5th book, got some \"P.E.--use equal space\" with the space between initials and a word space circled. Just because editors don't agree with you doesn't mean they don't have a good eye.\n\nLikely these were on looser lines, which are sometimes unavoidable (like when \"strengthen\" is trying to be the last word on the first line of a paragraph).

It seems to me that even collisions in combinations like \"T.T\" and \"T.V\" are more of a concern for typographers than readers. Would I care if I saw such a collision? Of course! Would many others? Probably not. So I guess it is up to the preference of who ever is paying the bill or whoever controls the typesetting choices. I can definitely see the advantage from a functional, as opposed to aesthetic, perspective of using a wider word space. But I've never heard anyone who wasn't involved in type-related fields ever mention that they wish typeset materials would return to the wider space, or that the continuous word spacing poses a challenge to their reading.\n\nI'm finding this really interesting. I had always just dogmatically assumed a preference for consistent spaces for everything but abbreviations, where I prefer thin spaces.

They generally wise up after some time.\n\nThe most serious effort at no caps was the Bayer, whose desire to do away with caps was a part of the movement in Germany to reject Blackletter, without simply imitating the rest of Europe. The idea was to use only all sans, no caps. (German capitalizes all nouns as well as beginnings of sentences.) It flopped also, though the Bauhaus effort to establish sans as useful in text has won out as an option.\n\nLowercase-only is a much worse practice than double spacing after sentences, because it slows the reader down by removing an expected symbol of the beginning of a new sentence.\n\nIt's interesting that TeX enables you to adjust space after sentences. I assume you have to tell the computer that a sentence has ended, as I don't know how you could distinguish an initial or abbreviation from a sentence end otherwise.\n\nYou can also play with this in InDesign using an additional thin space after sentences. I just can't see a double space as an improvement, except for monospaced fonts--and honestly I don't even see a double space as helping there either, because the period takes such a huge \"M\" space in a monospaced font anyway.\n\nCharles, I think over kerning of punctuation, such as is done in Minion, is a bad idea. It seems that Slimbach, who is great otherwise, has thought better of it in more recent fonts, though I don't have them myself, to check in detail.\n\nSpeaking of thin spaces, do you have an opinion on what thin space is most useful?

Of course, the Linotype linecaster wasn't on the em-system; a Monotype operator would give a different answer.\n\nWith modern computer fonts, back from the days when I was using TeX, I've used 155 units (1,000 unit em) for a thin space. I've been edging downward; sometimes using as little as 100 units. For me, a thin space should be recognizably smaller that the smallest wordspace that could occur with a justified setting. Obviously, with condensed fonts you need a correspondingly smaller value for a useful thinspace.\n\nWhat I put in Unicode 2009 depends on the font and it's nominal wordspace.

Books are not professionally set with two spaces, even when typewriters were the big dogs, since books were laid out and printed on a press. Pull down any book on your shelf—you won't find two spaces between sentences. We don't need the extra space to tell us when a new sentence has started.

Late-model machines employed a feature called \"unit adding.\" With this one could add space to the right side of the last letter in a word and delete the word space following. This could give very thin space between words.\n\nThere was also the possibility to subtract units from the body of some sorts and thus achieve, for instance, a kerned Wa combination right off the caster. In large display that was a huge bonus because the hand comp would not have to fiddle with the saw to make the kern.\n\nExactly how unit adding worked in concert with the Monotype's justifying system I do not know. I never learned the unit adding technique because my time as a Mono keyboarder was pretty short. Good keyboard operators could make great looking lines of type with these and some other tricks. I hope someone is teaching these tricks to the hardy band of young folks who are learning Monotypes today.\n\npowers\n\n"
