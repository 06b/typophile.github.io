A question about one's favourite fonts is the kind of matter you will find in older topics – sometimes in a specific way, as \"your favourite gothic sans\" or \"the best serif fonts for books\".\n\nSo, firstly you may try to do a search using Google this way:  \n\"what are your favourite fonts\" site: typophile.com\n\nThe forum has its own search, but it's not working by now.\n\nAnother good practice is what I'm doing now: although we both speak Portuguese, I wrote in English to let other users read our discussion.\n\n"
