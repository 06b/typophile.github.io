TF Arrow and Beufort were used as the template and the points were changed to make the current FAO logo (see the “W” which was modified) which apparently has more than five versions of itself. Ironically, breaking the rules of it’s own brand.\n\nThe logo reminds me very much of what Microsoft did to Helvetica, they changed some points and call their version Arial. It’s a cheap-ass design copout that is becoming all to familiar in the digital age.\n\n"
