      "content": "Pretty much all viruses are PC viruses. That doesn't mean that you don't need any virus protection if you are using a Mac since it only takes one.   \n   \nChances are that the testpilot mail server isn't really the problem. Many recent viruses will spoof the sender's email address so that it looks like it is coming from someone it isn't.   \nHere's how it works. Someone sends an email to TPC, adding the TPC email address to their address book. They also have Kris in their address book. This person gets the virus as an email attachment, and opens the file, infecting their system. What the virus does is send out a bunch of emails (with a copy of itself attached) picking out random people from the address book for both the \"to:\" and \"from:\" fields. This way it looks like the email came from TPC.   \n   \nDoes that make sense? [This](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526221802/http:/news.com.com/2100-1001-916945.html) might be a little clearer.\n\n"
