I'm interested in either your technical analysis of the fonts themselves or your opinion about the whole thing idea.\n\n",

The \"original\" [sic] URW fonts are really of very good quality, and that continues in the outlines that are directly sourced from the URW originals. The added Greek, Cyrillic, small caps and oldstyle figures are generally somewhere in a range from mediocre to poor to largely useless. Some are better than others. On the down side, look at the oldstyle two in the Palatino clone.\n\nI think this really shows both the strengths and weaknesses of open source fonts (maybe open source software in general?). There's some really first-rate material, and some utter junk, and it's mixed into a single font (or piece of software). But heck, it's free! :/\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Usually the response has been similar to Thomas Phinney's: mixed quality. I like the fact that Knuth's Computer Modern is given an \"honorable mention\" on the Typophile libre fonts wiki page. That's always been where I've placed it.\n\nAlthough I have purchased and installed for use with TeX many professional typefaces (thanks Adobe for allowing modification of the font files), I still have a keen interest in the freely-available font packages. It's not because of cost, but because I hope I'll find a package that contains a good typeface \\_and\\_ all the integration that's necessary to pair it with harmonizing mathematical symbols. I also hope to find packages that I can recommend to students that will allow them to improve the quality of their output.\n\nHere's a general question: The TeX Gyre web page provides information about the automated method used to generate small caps, which involves unequal scaling in the x and y directions and application of a brush to trace the outline and thicken it further in the x direction--just enough to match the upper case. While I know that any automated process isn't ideal, could such a process produce results \"good enough\" not to be embarrassing to someone choosing to use those glyphs? I once did that as a personal project with Palatino (URW Palladio) and felt that the letters came out OK, but my attempts at old-style numerals definitely delimited the extent of my skills.\n\nST\n\n"

The old-style figures were particularly bad.\n\nI'd say Thomas has it about right.\n\nWhen you think on it, typographic niceties are not required for communication -- lining figures and full caps communicate information adequately. The reason for their use is aesthetic, and if they are rendered poorly, they don't fulfill that function.\n\nOpenSource fonts are not about letting people get something for free. The licenses for most fonts, if adhered to, prohibit anyone but a large, successful commercial corporation from fully using them. For example, consider scholarly journals, which ideally are (1) printed, (2) put on the web, (3) available for downloading, and (4) etc. Sometimes the total subscriber base is as small as 1,000, though the total audience, esp. for single articles, may be significantly larger.\n\nWhat are they to do? Site licenses are prohibitively expensive. How many good OSF are there, maybe 1 or 2?\n\nAgain, Thomas is correct -- what is needed is a few good folk to donate their time & talent.\n\nThere is still plenty of business left for type designers. Just look at the design forum \"I need a font that looks like (whatever), but is new!!!\" IMSLTHO, most of the suggestions are inferior to (whatever).

And the glyph- and feature-loaded fonts that Adobe bundles with InDesign.\n\nSince FontLab 4.5 enabled Mac-based type designers--people like myself with independent foundries--to produce typographically-rich OpenType fonts three years ago, we have been working hard constructing these beasts, and they are starting to be published. Concurrently, Reading University has been seeding the industry with a new breed of broadly-educated (language, culture, coding, history) type designers who have a quite different foundation than the previous new generation of 200-character-per font, DIY deconstructionists. And also, an internet community of diverse stakeholders has coalesced and nurtured the development of mega-fonts\\*. All this is in play, and the scholarly publishing sector is beginning to reap the dividends.\n\nHaving spent thousands of hours in developing scholar-worthy fonts that are still not published, I already feel like I have donated enough time and talent, without having to put out freebies. I don't know exactly where I will recoup my investment, but I expect it will more likely be from the corporate and periodical sectors. Scholarly publishing will be a beneficiary, as the pool of suitable fonts available from independent foundries grows larger. So get out your cheque-book and build more fonts into your budget, because the new ideas that will stick will be those that are well thought out, well written, well edited, and well set--in well-designed new fonts.\n\n\\*An example: in his Typblography blog, Thomas Phinney started a thread on Cyrillic character support, in which he outlined his, and Adobe's philosophy. That really put things in perspective, and was an inspiration to me by providing a logical framework for increased character support (with examples). He also solicited feedback. So right there, the dynamic intersection of the corporate, the academic, and the independent.\n\nThomas, here's wishing you back on your feet soon.\n\n"

Scholarly publishing has gotten along only by more or less skirting the issue of embedded fonts appearing on the internet.\n\nAs far as whining goes, I have given of my talents, such as they are, to scholarly publishing. When needed, and when within the license, I have cut needed characters such as phonetic symbols, the Latin characters from Latin Extended A, B, and Additional. I've done what I can for the aesthetics of some fonts too, cutting small caps -- especially italic small caps -- sometimes roman as well. Occasionally, heart in hand, I even cut old-style numbers. I sweat a lot over the old-style 2. And other work.\n\nHow much do we charge for this? Not one damn cent.\n\nBut I do not have the skill to complete full alphabets, or some of the more intricate phonetic symbols, and the licenses forbid my releasing the characters I can do to the scholarly community generally. For the Adobe fonts, I'd give them to Adobe for re-release, but I imagine they wouldn't want them. They're OK, better that the fonts under discussion, but not perfect. They work for text size settings. Sorry I lack the skill but not the desire.\n\nI don't care if you don't participate. Your choices are yours to make. But why council others not to contribute a little? If you think university presses have the money & are just being tight, you are wrong.

Those familiar with LaTeX will know that Hermann Zapf was commissioned to create the Euler math fonts by the American Mathematical Society. They were originally created to complement Knuth's Concrete text fonts, but they are also a good complement to Palatino and other similar text fonts. I'd love to see this happen a few more times, perhaps creating several high-quality font packages to complement a wide range of text fonts.\n\nAnd while I'm giving my wish list, I'd love to see someone (pay to?) create a multiple-master font consisting of just those mathematical symbols that aren't letters and don't need as much design, but whose weight should be adjusted to match the text face. Many newer fonts are now shipping with Greek and other glyphs that would be useful for typesetting math, but they need matching symbols if everything is to piece together well. Computer modern is very complete and is often used to fill in missing glyphs in other typefaces, but its symbols are too light to match many of them. [The mathkit package attempted to do this using metafont in 1998, but I would guess that it produces bitmapped fonts as the final product.]\n\nI thought of giving this a try just before my son was born...

Like Caslon, it has sharp points; like Baskerville and Corona it is a Transitional design, and it happens to be beautiful. However, quite aside from Donald Knuth's preferred style of italic x, its italics needed to be altered for mathematical composition, specifically to change the italic v so that it would not be confused with the Greek nu. (The reduction in slant was done for technical reasons, and the slant of the italics for Modern No. 7 is the same as that for the regular Times Roman italic, so that is not required by the aesthetics of mathematical typography.)\n\nNeedless to say, if you are using a word processing program on a computer to set mathematics in Times Roman, the italics you are likely to get are going to be based on those of Times 327, not Times 569, even if that font has been digitized (even in Times 569, the modified g, v, and w were alternate forms, however).\n\nComputer Modern, while a contribution we should be grateful for, still \"looks funny\" compared to conventional fonts; there is an effort to design an improved version of it.\n\nWhile the font Modern No. 7 is reasonably attractive, it still looks somewhat dull and severe from the standpoint of current fashions. Partly, it suffers from being associated with the Scotch Roman styles used in 19th-century typography which was unattractive.\n\nIf one isn't bold enough to try AMS Euler or even Cambria Math, is there an obvious alternative? I think there is, and I'm surprised it seems to be neglected.\n\nI remember reading somewhere - and finding it confirmed by my experience - that if there are three competing magazines, each seeking its own typographic identity, a very likely result is that one will be set in Times Roman, another will be set in Caledonia, and then the third will be set in Century Expanded.\n\nCentury Expanded, of course, belongs to the same general category of typeface as Modern No. 7, but unlike both it and Computer Modern, it is fully acceptable to current tastes. So, to my mind, it is the \"obvious\" choice, but I don't see it being used much for mathematical publication.\n\n"
