  "content": "Howdy crew, we're currently hunting for some branding typefaces for our screen design and animation outfit called.\n\nWhile we've got some type directions in place that we're happy with, I thought I'd open it out to you knowledgeable folk to offer suggestions of typefaces that might hit the mark.\n\nAs a business we sit somewhere between a creative animation studio (Frankfurter) and a sharp, design-led VFX company (modified Baskerville Old Face). While the worlds are seemingly polar opposites, we feel there might be some middle ground worth exploring.\n\nSo ... with that little tidbit of info, got any suggestions of faces?  \nFire away with any questions too.\n\nCheers,\n\nPaul\n\n",
