Also, I would like to hear more about the usage of secondary typeface (ITC Legacy Sans, as already mentioned) for the \"hr solutions\" phrase.

It's a fine typeface, but in this case seems to lack personality. Try this (it might help with your design slump too :-) Print it out the word set in Melior nice and big. Get out some translucent paper (tracing etc) and work over the letters with a pencil. Alter the letterforms a bit, make it more like a bodoni, make it more like a slab serif, try a more even weight, try a sans serif Melior. Move quick and use lots of paper.   \n   \nOh, can it just be Accent HR? That rolls so much better. Words like solutions in a logo don't really add much IMHO. But clients will be clients.\n\n"

Yes, FontFolio cost me $3 for a cd in my motherland, but I do buy typefaces and tell the client, that he \\*needs\\* to buy one (normally, a family), if he doesn't want any problems.

Not to polute this board with my subtle changes in the designs, I won't post anything for now. He should reply me within an hour. We'll see.   \n   \nAbout the human type. The guy I was talking about it last night ( [http://daveraspin.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018212400/http:/daveraspin.com/)) was refering to his \"olympic games\" pitch and i's and j's in a human form. If we take existing M and T humans - we already have a good start for a new face! ^\\_^   \n   \nOh, Scott, your pal is a pervert if he thinks about sexuality when seeing that human T, word. ^\\_^   \n   \ncheers!\n\n"
