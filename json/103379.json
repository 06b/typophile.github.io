I'm beginning to think the original designer of the logo adjusted an existing font in Illustrator using outlines, but i'm hoping this isn't so.\n\nIt looks like it could be Century Gothic, or some other gothic, yet the capital \"E\" is really different.\n\nI'm redesigning this logo for a client and they want me to use the same font, yet they don't remember what it is, and I can't find it. :)\n\nThank you so much,\n\n-Piasaw\n\n",

In fact if it _is_ a font, it's likely to be plagiarized from Century Gothic, so best avoided.\n\nBut anyway: how hard is it to add a line to the \"C\"? In fact it would take less time than trying to find a font!\n\nAnd while you're at it, tighten the \"EW\".\n\nhhp\n\n"
