  "content": "Hello,  \nI am using FontLab Studio 5.  \nI am building an OT font that is all caps. My client requests that I have leading be 1\" from baseline to baseline when set at 70pts. I figured that would be about 70/72. In fontlab I have tried countless ways to do this in the custom values with no change. The only value I am working with is the caps height which is 706 as there are no descenders, ascenders or lower case glyphs in the font.\n\nany insight/help is appreciated!!\n\nthanks.\n\n",
