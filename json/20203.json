  "content": "Today at a store that sells remaindered books, I came across, and purchased, Simon Morley's \"Writing on the Wall: word and image in modern art\".\n\nLots of images showing the use of words in art from the late 1800s to the present.\n\nCan anyone recommend other books (apart from the ones on graffiti, with which I am already familiar) in the same vein?\n\nThanks.\n\n",
