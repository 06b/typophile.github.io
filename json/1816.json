  "content": "I have tried to create TTF and OTF fonts (using FontLab for Mac) that would work cross-platform. Everything is perfectly fine until I come to the part where the grouping in font families does come in. Is there a way to create a TTF/OTF font file that would show up with a submenu (say Helvetica Neue as the main font menu item and then 33 variations of it as its submenu items) so that it would work the same way in BOTH Mac and PC?   \n   \nI have tried many different combinations but there's always a problem on one of the platforms. If I get decent submenus on the Mac, the font won't work on a PC (it can then only have 4 submenu items). And if I name the fonts so that they show up on a PC (basically fill all the font info into all the name fields in FontLab - i.e. 'HelveticaNeue-LightExtended' for every field), the Mac font menu becomes huuuuuge.   \n   \nIs there some way to solve this problem? Maybe you can briefly explain the standards (if there are any?) of naming decent cross-platform fonts? Or point out some tutorials?   \n   \nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Typical Windows apps have a fixed family size of 4 or less fonts: regular, italic, bold and bold italic. If you have a larger family, you need to creatively name the fonts into discreet four-font families, e.g.:   \n   \nMyFont   \n MyFont-Regular   \n MyFont-Italic   \n MyFont-Bold   \n MyFont-Bold Italic   \n   \nMyFont Light   \n MyFontLight-Regular   \n MyFontLight-Italic   \n   \nMyFont Bold   \n MyFontBold-Regular   \n MyFontBold-Italic   \n   \nHowever, while you still need to do this for any TT and OT font, the latest versions of the name table specification include a second set of OpenType preferred family and subfamily names, which are what Adobe apps reference in menus and what future MS and other apps will use. Using the same example as above, the OT preferred family name could be set to 'MyFont', with the preferred subfamily names as indicated in brackets below:   \n   \nMyFont   \n MyFont-Regular [Regular]   \n MyFont-Italic [Italic]   \n MyFont-Bold [Semibold]   \n MyFont-BoldItalic [Semibold Italic]   \n   \nMyFont Light   \n MyFontLight-Regular [Light]   \n MyFontLight-Italic [Light Italic]   \n   \nMyFont Bold   \n MyFontBold-Regular [Bold]   \n MyFontBold-Italic [Bold Italic]   \n   \nYou can set OT preferred family and subfamily names in FontLab, on the second panel of the FontInfo window.\n\n"
