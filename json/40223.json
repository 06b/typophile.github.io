The title of the newsletter is still under debate but will be something about flow/current. The organization’s logo uses Optima (not my decision) along with a wave-like graphic.\n\nFYI, in the past we’ve used Slimbach and more recently Minion for the body text of the newsletter; I’m not yet sure if we’ll be changing that too.\n\nI’m clueless when it comes to readable, modern script fonts, so I’m thinking about a really nice italic version of a serif font. Thoughts?\n\n [‹ Programmer CV/Resume Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20071223123211/http:/typophile.com/node/40200 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Need a font with a good legibility... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071223123211/http:/typophile.com/node/40222 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
