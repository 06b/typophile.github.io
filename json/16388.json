When you have finished cursing about the one’s you bought at the original price, you may be tempted to some of these listed below. Stocks are limited and therefore we must offer them subject to availability. Please order directly though us. If anyone is interested the should email me — wardle [at] typophile [dot] com — and I will forward the email on to you. It was quite long, so I didn’t want to jam it all in here.\n\n[www.barrymckayrarebooks.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20071010114145/http:/www.barrymckayrarebooks.com/ \"www.barrymckayrarebooks.com\")\n\n",
