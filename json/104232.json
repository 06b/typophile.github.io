Limitations on the design of type will be almost completely eliminated. Without these constraints, there is only a blank canvas. What do you see as the future of type?\n\n",

They will be hungry. And mad.\n\nSo, I'd say type design, along with most everything else, will be trampled under the feet of warring soldiers.\n\nThat do for you?\n\n"

In fact, it's already dying, despite having been taught for decades,\" said Morgan Polikoff, assistant professor of education at the University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education. \"Very small proportions of adults use cursive for their day-to-day writing...As we have done with the abacus and the slide rule, it is time to retire the teaching of cursive,\" Polikoff said.\n\nThe recently established Common Core State Standards, the standardized educational benchmarks for U.S. public schools, omit cursive as a requirement. Some states, including Indiana and Hawaii, have dropped cursive from their curricula.\n\n"
