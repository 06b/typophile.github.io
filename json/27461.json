I decided to take the whole name instead, and hook the letters onto each other. But then some characteristics would disappear: let say, the 't' for example, didn't function as a 't', could be an 'l' as well.\n\nBy deleting some pieces, that problem was resolved.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to keep the autogram idea, it must be a fluent integration of letters, open and friendly.\n\n<cite>And how are you going to print it?</cite>\n\nWell, yeah, I still have to find out. ;-)\n\n"

I think this has better balance compared to the original. It is still readable as \"mateo\" but looks more complex now. Does that reflect your friend's character - or is he not complex. Perhaps you should also try something that speaks about him. Just a suggestion :)\n\n"
