This means that in Indesign, no matter what I turn on, I only see the real normal weight.\n\nI have tried finding a setting that will allow me to automatically build the names in the preferences option but I don’t see one. This brings up another problem: it seems like this option should be under the General section of the preferences; trying to access that menu crashes Fontlab but leaves it running (I can’t even send a report to Apple).\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n [‹ Proper Python/RoboFab Installation on Mac OS x 10.5 Leopard?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201031018/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39317 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Can't compile/generate OpenType in FontLab 5.0.0 (WinXP) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201031018/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39191 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
