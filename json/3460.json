Your sample shows that eagle can be used with class and sophistication.   \n   \nI dont care much for the lower case which were reverse engineered since the original eagle was a caps only font. I always wished the G was more like the one from your sample, because IMHO the one that Morris Fuller Benton designed is too quirky.\n\n"

Somehow in that setting it looked Mexican!   \n   \nSo I wouldn't be too stuck on how it originated. It's how you use it. If it is sparingly used, it might be great. Also Fontbureau's version has a range of weights.\n\n"
