  "content": "We are working on a project in the area of \"Avenue de Champagne\". Currently we are scouting for more information about the area and people who have influenced the local typography there and in France at the beginning of 20th century.\n\nHere are some examples of the type style we are interested to know more about:  \n [http://thingstodo.viator.com/champagne/files/2013/05/Avenue-de-Champagne...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417173434/http:/thingstodo.viator.com/champagne/files/2013/05/Avenue-de-Champagne.jpg \"http://thingstodo.viator.com/champagne/files/2013/05/Avenue-de-Champagne.jpg\")  \n [http://decantertours.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/champagne-man-in-ber...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417173434/http:/decantertours.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/champagne-man-in-berret-300x198.jpg \"http://decantertours.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/champagne-man-in-berret-300x198.jpg\")  \nOr is this common signage type in some areas of France?\n\nInsight, books, designers and why not even fonts appreciated.  \n(Reading has provided us with some history already but now we are looking for this specific style)\n\nThank you.\n\n",
