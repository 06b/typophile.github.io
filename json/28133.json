  "content": "As a project, I'm putting together a sort of code scrapbook, a small bound book with interesting excerpts of code from my work and small bits of prose about the code. I've been looking for font families that could supply both a serif typeface for paragraphs of text, a sans for captions next to the code, and a monospace font for the code itself. As you might expect, the set of font families with a well built monospace cut are very few. In fact I've managed to track down just two:\n\nQuadraat:  \n [Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017233454/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.6180.1.5), [Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017233454/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&displayfontid=FF.10989.0.0), and [Monospace](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017233454/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11188.1.5)\n\nThesis:  \n [Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017233454/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/theserif/serif-.html), [Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017233454/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/thesans/sans-.html), and [Monospace](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017233454/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/thesansmo/sansmo-.html)\n\nQuadraat might be a bit too mannered for this project. Thesis might be a bit too femine. Ideally there would be a monospaced version of Freight Micro since the rest of the family feels just right. I'll probably end up using Quadraat since the monospace works better in my eyes than TheSans Mono, but I'm still interested to know if there are more families out there with a monospace cut. Anyone know?\n\n",

This make me a little suspicious that it won't look so hot at a more normal letterspacing. Fedra looks more mature, as it should I suppose since it could reasonably be called Eureka 2.0.\n\nWhat I haven't been able to find at all is a well executed monospace font derived from a serifed design. Every well done monospace typeface is at heart a sans.\n\n"
