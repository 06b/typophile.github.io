  "content": "Hi all!\n\nJust a quick question. I have been using Berthold Caslon for a personal web project. But since my switch to a mac. I do not have a mac compatible version of the font (only in .pfb & .pfm). I am wondering which other cut of Caslon is most similar to the Berthold version?\n\nThanks in Advance!\n\nEric.\n\n [‹ Anyone know this one?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705161731/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43323 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [consciousness through typography ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705161731/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42788 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
