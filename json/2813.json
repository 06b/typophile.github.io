I checked the Solotype collection and Dover books on Art Nouveau and Victorian alphabets, but didn't see anything as close as the one you found, Yves. Scriptorium another place where things of this vintage often show up, but the names are almost always changed. Maybe Mark Simonson has some old type books? I think that's what's needed if you want to know what the real name was.\n\n",
