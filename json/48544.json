More prevalent. I don’t know if there’s such a generally valid equivalent for the ‘small’ letters in English.  \nIn German, there’s ‘die Versalie’ vs. ‘der Gemeine’ (‘the common’, latter mostly used in plural form). ‘Klein- und Großbuchstaben’ are the most widely used terms – but they’re not very adept. ;-)  \nF\n\n"

      "content": "Hello there\n\nI am not absolutely aware of any english-specific use of these words, but being french myself, I have to say that there is a huge difference between a \"capitale\" and a \"majuscule\": a majuscule is the first capital letter of a word (at the beginning of a sentence, in a family name, etc) - and that's it, period. To name every other capital letter in a sentence a majuscule is basically a mistake. Don't worry though: 99,9 % of John Does out there are making this mistake. Only the die-hard typophiles know about that... And that's a shame. In french typography, we also use the term \"bas de casse\" to describe a minuscule, for these were placed (as you know) at the bottom of the typographer's furniture (the \"casse\", \"case\" in english). The word \"capitale\" comes from the fact that these letters were placed at the top of the furniture, metaphorically called the \"head\", in latin: \"capitalis\".\n\nThis being said, I think that the use of \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase\" is strongly inappropriate since the disappearing of the case. As a typophile, I'd rather use \"capital\", \"majuscule\" and \"minuscule\" when I speak (in english) with someone who has a minimum typographic knowledge.\n\nHope I brought some interesting info here,  \ndr\n\n"

Caps and lowercase are used by us when the conversation turns to type (I would say those terms are antiquated but I don't want to see what they come up with to replace them). As to the hand-drawn issue it is as futile as the argument about whether calligraphy is art or craft. In my work and the majority of others our type IS hand drawn, it has just made the transition from paper and ink to digital form.I often see the term hand drawn lettering on this site. That is redundant. I also see the term lettering applied to buildings, typefaces used in titling etc. That is sign painting or whatever it is called these days and the other is type, pure and simple.\n\nAs to your contention that hand drawn... I agree with you. I think it is, in essence, a useless and ill informed modifier. At some stage it may have been lettering but by the time it is in digital form it is type, as long as they are repeatable forms and not a scanned title.\n\nI giggle at the term glyph. To me it has, and will always be, a carved form whether it is in stone or clay (from the Greek, glyphein, to carve). I will continue to create letters or characters in my fonts.\n\nNot a scholar but this stuff bothers me.\n\nMichael, One of those John Does\n\n"

I think it's potentially useful for describing hand-drawn illustrations that mimic typography, which is how my eyes see Dwiggins's work. I think it's an especially interesting case, because it reverses the usual type-designers-emulating-lettering process.\n\n"
