I very much appreciate his [treatise](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033328/http:/www.designbrown.com/explorations/volumetric_lettering/dev_notes.htm) on Roman lettering. I even did it into Russian when I was in school.

There isn’t any evidence of this.\n\nYou should try to find a copy of Fr Edward M. Catich’s _The Origin of the Serif,_ which a good university library should have, and the rarer _Letters redrawn from The Trajan inscription in Rome._ The latter is likely to be kept in special collections, although there are six copies for sale on ABE, beginning at $138.\n\n"
