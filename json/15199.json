I'd like to edit a small book with images to show my illustration, design and typography capabilities but I just have no idea what to work on. If any of you have any idea of texts that would be nice to edit I'd be very interested.\n\nThanks a lot,\n\nPierre-Luc\n\n",

      "content": "You might even try a long poem such as T.S. Eliot's \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufock,\" or a series of shorter, concise poems like hiakus or something. If it's portfolio work, you probably don't have to choose something in public domain, but the comment above is a good one. If you plan to reproduce the work, publish it on the internet or sell the work in any way, be very careful of copyright laws.
