  "content": "Hi,\n\nI drew some Serif like characters that will hope to result in a new font. It's my first Serif project, and of course it's far away from done.  \nOpen the attachment to see the characters I've made till now.  \nEverything drawn in PowerPoint. xD  \nWell, I like the \"a\" and the name of the font.\n\nNote again, I'm 15 and haven't yet any type designing lessons. :')\n\nKind regards,  \nMartijn van Berkel\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [RosioTest.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416121109/http:/typophile.com/files/RosioTest_0.pdf) | 31.63 KB |\n\n",
