  "content": "Hi,\n\nJust wondering if anyone got a hi res scan of this? I want to use it for a project, but can't find a digital version. Only a non-outline version called \"Lucifer\" have been digitalised. Not sure why it's called that. Was there never a Pluto Regular?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417161149im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DanXSolo-PlutoOutline_4077.png)\n\ncheers,\n\nPookey\n\n",
