The philologist took on the challenge to transform in Kafka’s rather eccentric letter forms into an balanced typographic flow. This meant not only creating hundreds of ligatures – each of them consisting of two, three or even four single characters – but also integrating numerous alternate characters to avoid successions of repeating shapes, in order to lend [FF Mister K](http://web.archive.org/web/20101127071749/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_mister_k_pro/?utm_source=NewsletterDec17&utm_medium=web&utm_content=FFMisterK&utm_term=em&utm_campaign=NewFontsBPType&sample_text=FF%20Mister%20K%20Pro%20by%20Julia%20Sysm%C3%A4l%C3%A4inen&sample_size=32 \"Download FF Mister K\") a more authentic script feel. Furthermore handy OpenType functions were added, for example for stylistic alternatives including hatched text as well as underlining and crossing out.\n\nEventually three completely different single fonts were developed. Besides the [normal cut](http://web.archive.org/web/20101127071749/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_mister_k_pro_regular/?sample_size=60) there’s also [Crossout](http://web.archive.org/web/20101127071749/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_mister_k_crossout_pro_regular/?sample_size=60), which allows for setting extensively crossed out text and [Onstage](http://web.archive.org/web/20101127071749/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_mister_k_onstage_pro_regular/), which clearly looks more extravagant and wriggly. FF Mister K is the only completely new design in the newest FontFont release 47 and is now online for sampling and download. It’s available in either a [Standard OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20101127071749/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_mister_k_ot/) or a [Pro version](http://web.archive.org/web/20101127071749/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_mister_k_pro/?utm_source=NewsletterDec17&utm_medium=web&utm_content=FFMisterK&utm_term=em&utm_campaign=NewFontsBPType&sample_text=FF%20Mister%20K%20Pro%20by%20Julia%20Sysm%C3%A4l%C3%A4inen&sample_size=32 \"Download FF Mister K\") with additional language support.
