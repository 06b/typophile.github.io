  "content": "Hi all,\n\nThis type appears in the Yeah Right! skate video (quality not fantastic from the screen grab) — lots of variation in the letters, so I'm guessing not a typeface. Any suggestions for something similar? Or indeed if it is a typeface, the one in question?\n\nAs always, thanks for the help!\n\nHigashi\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [handscript.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822222631/http:/typophile.com/files/handscript.jpg) | 89.87 KB |\n\n",
