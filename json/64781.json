(One web site claims to provide it, but the character set doesn't match what is offered on normal calculating keyboards. I remember long ago seeing it once in a book in a library, but I could no longer find it when I looked for it.)\n\nHearing about ATF Self-Spacing Type, I decided to look up the information, and eventually I also found information about other similar later products from ATF: their Typotabular Gothic and their Quick-Set Roman/Bold/Italic.\n\nI have compiled some of the information I ran across on this page on my web site:\n\n[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/propint.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116124240/http:/www.quadibloc.com/comp/propint.htm \"http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/propint.htm\")\n\n- it should be noted the site is concerned with mathematics and computers and things like that in general, not typography or artistic subjects.\n\n",
