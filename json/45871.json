I felt sooooooo bad, sooooo bad a designer, I felt sick to the pit of my stomach. I cried myself to sleep thinking I was the worse design student ever. I have a few more to go which I will post on here as I go along. I hope they work just as well. Please identify problems with my kerning, tracking, leading etc. All feedback welcome. My initial concept is a book that opens up into an A1 sheet, 1 paper to tie in with the 'first/1' theme and 1 colour, it being pantone No 1 but that colour seems so dull and uninteresting. I have thought of printing with gold ink onto a coloured paper like deep purple to represent 'quality', 'the best' as in royalty but not royalty literally. Good idea or bad? I know it will take away the concept of 'pantone No 1' but then I could say '1 colour only' instead. I know silver on light grey looks sophisticated and stylish but silver doesn't represent No1 or FIRST beacuse you would get a gold medal for coming first in a race, for instance. Yaay or naaay?\n\nPS Michael: It's okay. Thanks for the added info. It's always nice to know the extras :)\n\n"

Oh well...back to the subject of the work above, I know the kerning, tracking etc needs sorting on the rocket image. I have thought of using type for the fins but it doesn't read right 'so some said'. Hmm...I'll keep posting my work on here as I go along.\n\nPS Tiffany, I shall try a pointier 1 but do you not think I should have the same typeface all the way down? I find it really hard to mix and match fonts, as though I don't want to take risks. I'm just scared. Is that funny? Should it come naturally?\n\n"

      "content": "missgiggles, I think your solutions are very good.  \nIn this resolution the kerning and tracking in the rocket works as it is to me. You might want to widen the words that end with L, P and R a little, to fill the gaps in the right side of the rocket. I also think it might be valuable to look at the leading and make sure it is (optically) consistent.\n\nMixing typefaces can be tricky! In designs like this it might be best to stick to one family. I second Tiffany's suggestions about trying to draw the whole thing by hand, and/or finding a 1 that is more pointed (I'm thinking [Eagle](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145203/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/) or [Futura Black](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145203/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/futura-black/)). You might get away with just changing the font of the 1, if it is close enough in style to the other font you use.\n\nYou could also try tilting the rocket just a little, to make the design more alive.\n\nAs regards the ship, it might benefit from some tracking and kerning. The word spacing could be decreased somewhat, especially between THE and UN. As an alternative to the Bodoni, you could try using a 1910's art-deco font, such as [Bernhard](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145203/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bernhard-boldcond/).\n\nAs aluminum so wisely wrote: take the critique that you think is valuable, and ignore the rest. :)\n\n"

I wonder if you might loose the swirls at the base of the rocket and replace them with bigger & smaller letter \"d\"s or periods. Hmmm probably periods. I do like the idea of a tilt. Also you could chop off the arm of the one to make the rocket a simpler more rocket-like shape. Be proud of your good work. :-)\n\n"

Are they supposed to work in series? If so, you may want to think about the color choice between the two. On the first, I would tend to agree with Miss tiffany, the contrails don't seem to match the typeface. Have you tried maybe making the text the actual [lunar lander](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145203/http:/starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/StarChild/space_level2/apollo11_lem_big.gif) on a giant MANKIND planet?\n\n"

What do you think?\n\nTiffany, Mans and Eben: I know what you mean by using a pointier 1 as this could help eliminate the contrails at the bottom or I could try what Eben suggested about the contrast of lowercase d's. What are periods by the way? Please explain. Thanks.\n\nZwoelf: As this is an A5 book that folds out into an A1, I had to make a decision on whether they were going to be portrait or landscape. I was reluctant to stick to portrait as they could also be displayed as type posters in their own right.\n\nChris G: I need to sort my portholes out. I am thinking of photographic portholes rather than illustrations. The thing with using colour is that my book is meant to be one colour only (goldish colour to celebrate excellence) and due to that, I have to try and work ways round it as colour plays an important role when trying to convey a message. Otherwise, teh idea of using yellow at the top would have been great.\n\nChipman: I used the top of an 'O' for my rocket to sit on but it made it look too complex, thus lacked simplicity. I am still experimenting with my layouts as there's definitely more work to be done to bring it up to perfection. I will try what Eben has suggested but I don't know what 'periods' are. Can someone please explain.\n\nPS Would someone be able to tell me more about the Onyx typeface (titanic poster). I know it was created in 1937 by Gerry Powell but what characteristics does it portray? Is it from the modernist era (by the way...I am no pro, i'm amateur. Please educate me. Thank you.\n\n"

How about a slightly celtic influence style to the body copy seeing as the Titanic was built in Belfast, or even referencing the typography of time (which included some amazing hand drawn work). The gold theme you suggest really doesn't add up for me, and the whole layout seems a little cramped, if it's going to b a poster you need to allow more space all around for the mounting. purple and foil block ( as that the nly real way of getting gold on a poster) again doest fit with the theme, I'd look closer at posters of the time and their colour schemes then update your selection.\n\nIt wasn't until you explained what your Maggie Thatcher poster was about until I got it, and I am pretty into my politics.  \nThe poster doesn't in anyway remind me of Maggie, it's far too subtle (she wasn't anything like subtle). If a poster requires an explanation then it's really failed in it's job. I think a poster more influenced by it's era, (the 80's) or even influenced by the highly successful Saatchi & Saatchi campaign would be a more appropriate avenue to explore.\n\nLooking forward to more of your revisions  \nMartin\n\n"
