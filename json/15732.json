  "content": "Hi. I'm looking for information and recommmendations on where to source a budget-friendly yet useful collection of fonts for students of a 3rd level course in graphic design. The collection would need to familiarise the students with all the important typefaces, historically and aesthetically. The budget is 2,500 euro or thereabouts. Any clues?\n\n",

Bitstream's [Type Oddyssey](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015092205/http:/www.myfonts.com/info/bitstream-type-odyssey-2/?refby=typographica) (1,450 fonts for $1495) or the [Linotype Essential CDs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015092205/http:/www.myfonts.com/info/linotype-font-cds/#LinotypeEssentialsCDs?refby=typographica). Make sure you ask about an educational discount.\n\nFinally, top it with the best of contemporary typefaces with any of the [FontFont CDs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015092205/http:/www.fontshop.com/products/libraries.cfm#fontfont). They offer a 30% educational discount.\n\n"
