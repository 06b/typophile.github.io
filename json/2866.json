Note the differences between the individual letters \"arum\" between the two words, especially the \"a\".   \n   \nSince you have halfway descent images of these logos, it wouldn't be too hard to redraw them in something like Illustrator. (Or maybe even hire someone to do it for you. :-)\n\n"

As an Alyce (pronounced Alice, just spelled with a y) and a cat lover it ocurred to me to use the cheshire cat in my own stationery, etc. Your tie in is obviously much closer. Several years ago I bought one-time usage rights from Bettmann Archives for the original Tenniel illustration, for a Friskies magazine project.

Tenniel's been dead for nearly 100 years!

The price was cheap to protect ourselves and the client.   \n   \nHave you seen the Pennyroyal editions of Alice? They were designed and illustrated by Barry Moser. Illustrations, page design and typography are all beautiful.

I found myself wondering about the Disney film \"Newsies,\" since newspapers seem to be a stumbling block for many of the films you cited.   \n   \nLiving in Los Angeles we are able to recognize many film locations. Downtown, in particular gets used a lot. 7th Street was recently dressed to look like New York for the next Spiderman movie. Fake signage was up for about a week ï¿½ our Metro station even had a New York subway sign added. I wonder how many tourists were totally confused.\n\n"
