My name's Eston, and I'm a student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nI'm currently taking a journalism class at the University, and my old-school professor is really fond of the Linotype and the whole hot type era, as it was just fading away as he started his career as a reporter. He's starting a website (that I'm helping him get off the ground,) and I'd love to get a Linotype slug custom-made for him as a sort of nostalgic gift.\n\nThe problem is that these machines are near-impossible to find, let alone in a working form. Do any of you have (or know anyone that has) a _working_ Linotype machine that may be able to cast a slug for my professor? I'd be willing to pay for one.\n\nThanks. Sorry this isn't a wonderful first post, but I'll definitely be sticking around. Now, where is my Bringhurst book... I think I should read that before I say much more. :)\n\n",
