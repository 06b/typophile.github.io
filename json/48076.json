  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am working on a brand for a charity. I have a concept in place for imagery, I plan to use Nautical style imagery, nice black and white images of lighthouses, waves crashing against the rocks etc.\n\nAs part of the brand, I am working on the logo, I was wondering if somebody can help me with font ideas that would work well with this style of imagery, a font that has a gentle nod to the nautical side of things, yet strong enough to stand on its own. The style of imagery may change in the future, therefore, the font needs to have a timeless feel.\n\nI am currently working with Adobe Garamond Pro, but would love some more creative variations.\n\nAppreciate any help.\n\n",

I also wonder how something like Didot or Bodoni would look. Maybe you could post some examples of what you've been doing.\n\nAnalisa\n\n"
