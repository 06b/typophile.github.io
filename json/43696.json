  "content": "Hi,\n\nI would like to do a handwriting signature for a DVD cover (TIFF 300 dpi).\n\nMy cover is in Photoshop. Black background. I used the “sharp” setting for my fonts (mainly Eurostile)\n\nI need to do the handwriting in white on black.\n\nI had some info in this thread: [http://www.typophile.com/node/20954](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821154230/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20954 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/20954\"), about Illustrator, Live trace, Photoshop etc.\n\nBut I‘m still confused...\n\nWhat will be the best way to do this? Can I do it by hand straight into photoshop or Illustrator? Hand tracing, scan / Livetrace, Pen tool?\n\nI never used illustrator before but I can try. I use Photoshop usually.\n\nMany thanks.\n\n [‹ kgreenlandic & napostrophe as small cap](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821154230/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35971 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type for historic brewery ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821154230/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43653 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In other words, I wouldn’t trace it, I’d use it as a picture.  \nAnd since it’s supposed to be white, just inverse it.\n\n"
