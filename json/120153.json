Faunus is pretty subtle, though.\n\nRiffing on the Jenson Oldstyle / Kelmscott direction, one could also go with a more classic Jenson, such as\n\nCloister [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-cloister/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150106225926/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-cloister/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-cloister/\")  \nCentaur [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/centaur/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150106225926/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/centaur/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/centaur/\")  \nAdobe Jenson [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/jenson/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150106225926/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/jenson/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/jenson/\")\n\n“Sword & Sorcery” implies a sort of wild, low fantasy setting, though. I am thinking Fritz Leiber and the like. This stuff was especially popular back in the 1970s and became associated with the art nouveau revival that was popular at the time. In that vein, the earlier suggestion of my revival, Cristoforo, is reasonable. I'd avoid Arnold Boecklin as being a bit of a cliche, but there's plenty of other stuff in that vein.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/search/art+nouveau/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150106225926/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/art+nouveau/fonts/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/search/art+nouveau/fonts/\")\n\n"
