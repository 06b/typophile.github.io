  "content": "On a design blog called Be A Design Group, which I read regularly, an article was posted yesterday titled ' [Five Steps to Font Freedom](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223828/http:/www.beadesigngroup.com/blog/archives/2006/03/five_steps_to_font_freedom.html). The article is addressing the severe lack of fonts for web design and proposes some ideas on propagating them such that web type would be 'liberated'.\n\nThe bullet points are:\n\n1. Convince the Font Companies to Surrender Their Monopoly  \n2. Create Read-Only Versions of Fonts  \n3. Adopt the Free Versions of Fonts  \n4. Share Your Fonts  \n5. Build Free Versions of the Classic Fonts\n\nIt's written by a designer, not a type-centric person, and as such it explores ideas that will probably make a large number of you freak out. The thesis seems to be: I don't have to have a font to read a book, so why do I have to have it to read a website? It then examines a handful of conceptual, rather than practical, ways that this could be overcome. While I think the article is reflective of a certain degree of naiveté, it also reflects a very real and very legitimate frustration. If some of the generous and knowledgeable Typophiles from these forums drifted over there and contributed thoughtful and informed thoughts on what could/would/does/doesn't work, the discussion could break out of the insulated walls of our own little realm and perhaps inform a broader graphic design audience about type. The site is run by designers who are also teachers, so I presume many of their students regularly read their site as well.\n\nAgain, some of what they suggest will probably be offensive to those who make type for a living, but they're a good group of guys asking honest questions about real concerns, not a bunch of jerks who just want to pirate fonts or something. So I encourage you to wander over and help enlighten people about type.\n\n",

But what if there were legal ways to give fonts to the masses? Wouldn’t you support any effort to increase the options for web fonts?_\n\n[My own comment](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223828/http:/www.beadesigngroup.com/blog/archives/2006/03/five_steps_to_font_freedom.html) is a response to flawed thinking, not on the wish to create better viewing experiences for internet visitors.\n\nBuckminster Fuller's parable about the businessman and the grand piano is all about thinking a solution that worked for a given situation is the best or only approach to solving the core problem.\n\nJust because someone did a great job with font selection on a web site does not mean that public availability to the BEST or most popular fonts is a solution to better web communications. That simply is not a wise or forward thinking approach.\n\nFont formats and technology can be and most likely will be re-invented by the large corporate manufacturers of hardware and systems software who have billions of dollars at stake.\n\nIf you bought a cassette recording of your favorite album years ago, did you rebuy it once the CD became available? Same thing with video tapes being replaced by DVDs.\n\nNow remember, if a typeface designer/font manufacturer originally designed a face for phototypesetters, it had to be completely revisited and re-manufactured for PostScript, TrueType, OpenType, et al. Each time a font format changes, the designer or font manufacturer needs to revisit the entire design, many times adding scores of new characters to fill out the new font requirements.\n\nGraphic designers are usually hired to produce a project and few would ever do a job that the client hadn't decided whether to pay for or not. Type designs are worked on, created and produced into fonts whether anyone is going to buy them or not. Creating three type families of four style weights each (regular, italic, bold, bold italic) adds up to twelve products that may never be purchased. Hardly a way to make a gainful living. The phrase \"free fonts\" is an invitation to fight.\n\n"

And they certainly aren’t greedy - if they were, they’d be in another line of business.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of type vendors and designers already set their fonts for “preview and print” embedding, or some more liberal setting. They’ve already done their part.\n\nThe problem is that there is no universally accepted solution for font embedding on the web. I think Adrian sort of gets that, but he seems to think that it’s up to the font folks to solve. But really this is a problem for the web folks to solve - perhaps with input from the font people.\n\nAny of the previous solutions that relied on distributing fonts for end users to install up front has been fundamentally flawed. insofar as it keeps designers using a handful of fonts that are universal, and relies on something largely outside of their control - that the user already has the font installed. Even if the fonts are freely available, the web is too much of an instant-gratification medium for web designers to be able to rely on people installing specific fonts just to view a site.\n\nThe W3C is considering a new mechanism that would allow a reference to a font in a specified format on the web site, perhaps in a Zip file. That’s an improvement, because it gets the font automatically loaded - but you’d still be limited to free fonts, which isn’t very exciting. And convincing the rights-holders that they should give their work away isn’t going to work here any more than it did in the music industry.\n\nStill, it’s a big problem. You need to convince the folks who own the web browsers and the web authoring applications that there’s a big market for a solution. The font foundries already know this and most of them are as eager for a good solution as you are.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

Among the keynote speakers were Bucky Fuller and [Marshall McLuhan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223828/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan), and the attending audience was filled with luminaries such as [Andy Warhol](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223828/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_warhol), who made a personal statement by sitting in the lounge during the entire conference reading the New York Times.\n\nFuller used a variant of the \"Businessman and Piano\" parable in his speech, the original version I found later in one of his essays on problem solving. I've rarely made a reference to this, since on one occasion I got blank stares and questioned, \"What does THAT have to do with the problem at hand?\".\n\nFuller was one of a handful of individuals who broke down and reshaped how I approach problem solving.

Its the same reason people cater to other arguably inferior products (IE 6, Windows Media, etc) when their own preferred technologies are being given away.\n\nThe only way we can even dream of having, well, if not good then at least diverse typography on the internet is by developing a system that enables designers to embed typefaces into a document (not a browser) while still observing copyright law. sIFR is a good example of this (or the use of embedded fonts in any flash for that matter). Or maybe it isn't. Though its technically flawed, its an attempt at something that seems worthwhile. It utilizes fairly ubiquitous technology, and works independent of browsers (an important factor if we want to have any reasonable hope of consistent rendering.) Any thoughts on this?\n\n"

This then caused the web to be typographically illiterate, where it remains, and subsequently has forced users to choose only from fonts that have been prepaid for them by the Adobe, MS and Apple and so are freely available to all. I made all this known in the mid-90's after a third design conference where the finger was pointed at ME as a representative of the source of the problem with fonts on the web. I laughed then, but after a decade of no progress in this area, it's not so funny, I guess (I don't go to design conferences much any more ;)). The best retort to this after all these years, is that there is no need for good type on the web, 'cause there is no possibility for good typography.\n\nMaybe when \"they\" make it possible to choose \"any point size\". Maybe when \"they\" make it possible to tune the color of type. Maybe when \"they\" enable H&J. Leading anyone? Portability, fidelity, and basic typographic functionality are sorely lacking on the web as a result of the poor leadership and inadequate evangelization from positions of supposed responsibility (and supposed typographic fraternity) in these companies. Until that is solved, we are the whipping boys and girls, boys and girls. My conscience is clear on this, and I would put 100 web fonts on the market in 12 months if there was a market that could employ our quality, and pay for it.\n\n"

For all the type designers who are afraid of embedded fonts: either we figure something out or everything from books to phones will be TNR/Arial, or whatever preinstalled flavor of the week. We will take the font choice out of the designers hands. Designers are the ones who value and will buy new type. Take away their ability to spec new type, and no one is buying new type.\n\nThink about it. If designers could use a new font on every web site, phone, ebook, signage system, etc, they would. And they would pay for it, or even better, get their client to pay for it.\n\nI think that PDF/Flash are headed in the right direction. While they don't completely protect fonts from piracy, most people don't know how/won't go to effort to rip the font data out. A pdf style embedded format + css support would solve a lot of problems.

The fees, of course, would have to be enough to offset the probable loss that would by incurred by the font developer for having his/her fonts freely available. It would have the advantage that no new font format would need to be developed. This is already being done to some extent with fonts bundled with operating systems, so it's not a totally radical idea.\n\nThe only big downside I can see in this scenario (one that Nick Shinn will probably have thought of already) is that it could have a chilling effect on the development and sale of fonts not privileged to be licensed by such an organization. It would be the bundled font problem squared. Or maybe not. The question is, who are buying fonts now and would they buy fewer in such a scenario? Perhaps fonts not in the pool would be more highly valued by designers, just as many of them shun bundled fonts now. I don't know.\n\n"

Along with Lewis Mumford and Ernst Cassirer, Fuller was one of the true visionaries of the twentieth century.\n\nSince I attended a small, conservative Catholic college in the 1960s, I also had occasion to meet Marshall McLuhan (yes, a conservative Catholic), whom I found far more approachable and actually interested in talking _with_ (rather than _down to_) students than William F. Buckley (also a conservative Catholic, who had a nephew attending the college). And, oddly enough, connections through this same college (long and involved story) allowed me to meet Andy Warhol: all I can say about Andy is that he was a mighty fine shoe illustrator who looked into the soul of America, and learned its deepest, darkest secrets of shameless self-promotion. Everything that Steve Jobs is today he owes to Andy...\n\n"

It was mostly for senior staff and the big wheel suits but I got to come along to take pictures of the event. As everyone was going in to the room, Bucky was at the door and was being introduced to all the upper staff. Bucky quickly noticed that only the suits were being introduced to him. He countered the measure by asking the VP, \"but who is that?\" (pointing to the secretary) and \"Who is that?\" (pointing to me). He walked over and gave a warmer and very sincere greeting to all the unannounced than to all the big wheels. He gave a fantastic talk about consciousness to design needs of the world being more important than profit only thinking.  \nI will never forget him for being a caring human being (and for seeking me out to say hello).  \nWhen I find the pictures I took of him, I will post one.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry for being late to th discussion here, but the core problem here is much more basic:  \nThe web is being used in a way it was never designed for.  \nThe reason that HTML (and it's descendants) do not have a good way of dealing with fonts is that the medium was built around CONTENT, not APPEARANCE. This has been lost along the way. The intention of HTML was a markup language, a way to convey the information, with the appearance having options only as necessary to aid in the understanding of the information. The idea was that each viewer would see it in a different font, and that was OK. The content was the important thing.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that intent is even valid. In the business we are in, I think most of us believe that separating content from appearance is not valuable, and separating appearance from understanding is even futile. But the point is that we've been trying to \"tweak\" this technology for the past 15 years to make it do something that's essentially in opposition to it's original purpose. We probably should have made a real paradigm shift a decade or so ago, and perhaps that's still what we need, as far as the type of document that's transmitted on the web.\n\n"

      "content": "jason: your point is well taken, but I think the story of HTML is a little more complicated than that. Strict separation of structure from presentation is one of the philosophical threads behind the creation of HTML, but early HTML was just as strongly influenced by pragmatic implementors who didn't mind putting in tags for appearance either. It's too bad those early decisions were all made by people with no typographic sophistication, but that's a separate issue. I find it at least plausible that the success of HTML is due to its success at hybridizing the two philosophies, rather than being slavish to just structure (as is the case for many XML technologies today, like RSS), or just presentation (as in PostScript and less-enlightened PDF).\n\n"

Or Comic Sans!\n\nHowever, if one perceives it as a major problem that a free Linux distribution can't include the same variety of fonts as are included with, say, Corel products (which license a major chunk of the Bitstream catalogue) then this cry to \"liberate\" fonts _would_ make sense, and I suspect this is the sort of thinking that is behind this - the free software world is to match what the pay software world does in every respect, until Microsoft, Corel, Oracle, and many other companies end up giving their products away and exist by selling support, just like Red Hat.\n\n"
