  "content": "Once again I have fallen under the influence of my [fashion conscious](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014024557/http:/www.fontcraft.com/fontcraft/?p=1301) teenage daughter, who tells me that I absolutely must produce more \"shabby chic\" fonts like the [trendy scrapbookers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014024557/http:/www.useyourtype.blogspot.com/) and [hip fashion label designers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014024557/http:/grayhood.com/) use.

The result is the new Andrano font with a name picked because there's something sort of Italian looking about the font. It features wide and ornate characters with jewel-like internal embellishments and a subtle built-in shadow to give the illusion of depth. The upper case characters are somewhat skewed and misaligned versions of the standard character set. So far my teenaged adviser is fairly pleased with it and she claims that because of her influence it will be a sure bestseller, so here it is.\n\nFor more info and to download the demo version see [fontcraft.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014024557/http:/www.fontcraft.com/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014024557im_/http:/typophile.com/files/andranomf_5387.jpg)\n\n",
