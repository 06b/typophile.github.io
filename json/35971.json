      "content": "The kgreenlandic (kra) has a lowercase form only. Good question as to what to use in a small caps setting (or in an all caps setting, for that matter). We'll need an expert to weigh in, but other than avoiding such a setting, my inclination would be to design a usual kra glyph that matched the height of the small caps (typically slightly higher than x-height) and another to match cap height. But that might be seen as incorrect by native users. Just looking at Minion Pro, I don't see anything other than the normal x-height kra. The kra is now replaced by \"q\".\n\n"

As far as I know both letters are not being used any more.  \n [http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?ucode=0149](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013232223/http:/www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?ucode=0149 \"http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?ucode=0149\")\n\nBut if you add them to your font, people should at least be able to use it correctly. And when they switch to small caps and these letters would stay lower case, that would not be quite elegant ...\n\n"

John, you are saying that Indesign should be doing something. What do you think of putting code in to point to the correct Special glyph. Isn't that what happens All caps & Small Caps anyway?\n\nI have been increasingly convinced that a seperate Small cap font rather than a single font containg Roman Caps & Small Caps is a good idea anyway since Indesign & other apps don't have a very elegant way of handling the issue yet - and may or may not evolve one.

I've skimmed the contents at Google Books, and nowhere does he seem to use capitals for any Greenlandic words. His German is far more sparse on capitals than I am used, for that matter.\n\nI tried to find examples of Greenlandic books in the pre-1973 orthography at Google Books, and found [this example](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013232223/http:/books.google.com/books?id=fiETAAAAYAAJ&q=Av%C3%A1ngarnisalerss%C3%A2rutit+K'anak&dq=Av%C3%A1ngarnisalerss%C3%A2rutit+K'anak&lr=&pgis=1) which has the form K’ânâĸ (Qaanaaq in today's orthography) with what looks like a modifier letter apostrophe. So score one for SIL. This is just one example, though, and it's a rather small sample size. I would like to see more, but it's difficult to find a fully browsable book written in pre-1973-orthography Greenlandic at Google Books for copyright reasons.\n\nI did find [this snippet](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013232223/http:/books.google.com/books?lr=&id=VkYaAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject%3A%22Greenland%22&q=diary&pgis=1#search) of part of a map with \"K’ânâĸ\" written by hand, but it's too small to see what's really going on in there with the diacritical marks.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick, the example with the capital kra that I just posted is from a 1909 book. So this issue is likely something that conforms to its own set of conventions, and Everson and SIL are not arbitrarily inventing anything. They are merely describing what seems to have been standard practice.\n\nNick: <cite>This is so obscure you could probably set your own standard.</cite>  \nThis is a whole language and a literary tradition you are talking about. Do you think type designers should disregard the accepted practices just to have fun in designing a new glyph, which would only serve to cause confusion in the representation of historic spellings? At least the German eszett is still in use so the possibility is there for a gradual acceptance of a capital form.\n\nThe archaic Greek letters pre-dating the bicameral divergence of the Greek alphabet are a fun challenge for type designers, because there is a need for them, as you said. That's where we can exercise creativity and work toward building up some kind of consensus. The Kra doesn't need our help.\n\n"

I mean, the lower case character isn't just a \"k\" with a diacritic, is it?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013232223im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Kras_6601.png)\n  \nBut this is hypothetical, there are other more useful characters to put in fonts!  \nThomas Phinney made a good point in his blog, when discussing which Cyrillic characters to add to a font, that using the number of speakers of a language is a good criterion. So if there are a lot of speakers, it's useful to support a language. And perhaps also if it's endangered. But really, what possible use is there in retconning a deprecated glyph? \n"

You could take either position legitimately as long as you acknowledge your reasons for doing what you do. My preference would be to look to the historical precedent - and then step out from there if at all. But doing that is only my prerogative - not the only right way.\n\nIt is important to consider that a language with not a ton of readers & not a a ton of books was probably given less thought & consideration typographically speaking than other languages. It seems likely to me that the glyph design solutions they evolved might be a bit too slapped together and could stand being reconsidered especially if it was done in a manner that was culturally historically sympathetic. Acknowledgment that a given solution is <cite>completely legitimate</cite> doesn't preclude new ideas. How do you know that the Kra couldn't be helped? I don't! The world can't be split into simply retroactive continuity vs. simple revisionism. Insisting on this split takes your eyes of glyph designs and therefore real consideration of the issue.\n\nWhat is the population of readers of this glyph set anyway?\n\n"

The old Afrikaans character U+0149 is not a letter with a combining mark it is, as the Unicode name indicates LATIN SMALL LETTER N PRECEDED BY APOSTROPHE. It has a compatibility decomposition to U+02BC (spacing apostrophe modifier) followed by U+006E (n), and the Unicode special casing rules indicate that the uppercase form is U+02BC followed by U+004E (N). In other words, the typical rendering for this diacritic character should be identical to ’n and ’N.\n\n"
