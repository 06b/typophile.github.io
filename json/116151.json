  "content": "Hey guys! I'm currently working on some collateral material for a brand I've created. I'm looking for a serif style font that has variations in their baselines for its numericals. Fonts in the vein of [Poster Bodoni](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419204606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/poster-bodoni) or [Encorpada Classic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419204606/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dootype/encorpada-classic) are what I've been playing with. Thanks for any suggestions!\n\n",

      "content": "The type of numerals you're after are called \"old style figures\" or \"ranging figures\" or (more rarely, but quite suitably) \"text figures\". They were unpopular for about a century (after being the standard style for text cuts of typefaces for the previous four centuries or so), but have recently had a significant resurgence – just about any professional serif face designed in the past decade (and quite a few in the preceding ones) will have them somewhere, and quite a few will have them as standard.\n\nThat said, the high-contrast style you've been looking at (the \"didones\" or \"moderns\" originally appearing in the nineteenth century) feature old style numerals more rarely than most – mainly because that's precisely when they went out of fashion, so the original fonts now revived often didn't have them. Here's some that MyFonts throws up for a search for didone+old-style numerals:\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Adidone+tag%3A%22old-style+numerals%2...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419204606/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Adidone+tag%3A%22old-style+numerals%22/fonts/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Adidone+tag%3A%22old-style+numerals%22/fonts/\")\n\n"
