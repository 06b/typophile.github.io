      "content": "the Rodney Sheldon Fehsenfeld font you used seems a bit dated.   \nTo assist you in finding the right typeface, it would be helpful to know more about the client / restaurant. Upscale or inexpensive daily grub. Location - mall, college town or suburbs, the type of people you would expect to visit this place- business folks of high school students. Alchohol establishment or not. In other words serious demographics. I am no legal expert but the name sure sounds a lot like the famous Chili's franchise. To take precaution perhaps it would be worth suggesting to your client to double check with lawyer who knows copyright laws regarding the name.\n\n"

      "content": "C, where are you going to school, if its in a city, I'd suggest walking around and looking at the signage, if thats not possible, surf the web and look at the logos of some of the chains like McDonalds and Chili's. Start your logo design with pencil to paper, come up with the shapes that you like, then find the type to suit. Make sure you tell the potential client its a restaurant and the type of atmosphere and food thats served.\n\n"

      "content": "\"this logo just 4 our school assignments\" is a bullshit excuse.   \n   \nSchool work can be your best work. Take this seriously.   \n   \nIn real life you will have clients that have no consistant   \nviews regarding branding and identity, It will be your task to educate them and explain why some things will work and others   \nwill not. You will have to consider everything, and bill them for your expertise.   \n   \nExample- I am billing a client $2600 tomorrow to do pre-liminary scope of their branding needs. No actual design work just consulting and planning. With better planning better work will be done in the end that is target orinented and a real business tool with actual worth (intellectual property), not just something to physically differentiate a restaurant from it's neighbor the corner grocery store.   \n   \nTake this chance to created an original, logical, and aesthetic   \nidentity for a client (even if it imaginary or a professor)   \n   \nIn the real world you will have to fight for your ideas, or become   \nsomeone who just does as clients suggest and make a few bucks but never feels proud of the work. Later you may find clients that want you to think harder and develop better concepts but   \nbecause your portfolio does not reflect great concepts and deployment of concepts no one will listen. You are smart to ask good question at this stage in you education, and to spend the time to deliver a viable solution. This work can get you hired.   \n   \nThis process will obviously take more time, so have another cup of coffee and stay up all night to deliver something exceptional.\n\n"

Make the type look like it is etched into the ice cube. and maybe let the cube melt a bit so it looks cool and refreshing. Add a tagline something about cool and refreshing food and drinks. There is a chain called Chillys here that features hot and spicy food you need to make sure you get what your resturant does across to the consumer clearly. Remember the meaning of Assume. Assume means make an  of U and Me. So don't assume the customer knows anything.\n\n"
