  "content": "My aunt wants me to create a mock \"Sexiest Man Alive\" magazine cover for her boyfriend's birthday. Does anyone know what the font for \"Sexiest Man Alive\" is, or one that is similar? Its the same on each annual issue.\n\nFor the \"People\" logo, I just downloaded a high-res image of an original mag cover and made a path around the logo. So I don't need that.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130731195959im_/http:/typophile.com/files/11_27_06_UPC_300x400_4210.jpg)\n\n",

You'd think they'd want to set themselves apart rather than mimic.\n\nPerhaps I have the chronology backwards. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n"
