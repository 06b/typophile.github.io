  "content": "What, if any, accented characters (i.e., glyphs with diacritical marks such as Aacute or tcaron) are found in combinations that are commonly covered by ligatures? For example, c\\_t is a somewhat common ligature to include in well-rounded OpenType fonts. Would it also make sense to have c\\_tcaron or c\\_tbar? What about L\\_Aacute in an all-caps font that includes an L\\_A ligature?\n\nI am looking for guidance, because I'm just not yet familiar enough with some of the languages that use these diacritics. I would appreciate any help. Pointing out useful references on the topic would be especially helpful.\n\nThanks, all.\n\nTim\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks. There's some good discussion there, but it's mostly around handling colliding accents. I'm more interested in ligatures coverage across languages.\n\nTaking c\\_t as an example: if I were to include a c\\_t ligature in a font and also wanted to provide glyphs across the Latin ranges, should I also then include ligatures for ccedilla\\_t, c\\_tcaron, c\\_tbar, etc.? I am not sure what combinations are even possible across all the different languages. I don't think ccedilla\\_t actually occurs in reality, so there would be no need to include such a ligature. I'm just not sure which combinations are possible.\n\nJust a few discretionary ligatures lead to a significant range of accented possibilities. Consider: s\\_t, c\\_t, o\\_o, s\\_p, T\\_h, L\\_A, N\\_N, R\\_A, T\\_T, T\\_Y....\n\nTim\n\n"
