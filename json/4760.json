  "content": "Hey, Typophiles --   \n   \nSo there I was, working on my new movie (a noir thriller, not another \"Behind the Typeface\"), fretting over the realization that I was going to need to come up with a bunch of names for the credits on some movie posters that will appear in the movie. Then it occurred to me that there's this huge bunch of people right in front of me whose names I'd love to include, since of course the movie has something to do with typography.   \n   \nSo here's the deal: respond here or [email me](mailto:cheshire@cheshiredave.com) with how you'd like your name to appear, and I guarantee your name will appear on at least one movie poster. I'll try to make them as legible as possible, though for verisimilitude they'll have to be in at least an approximation of that really condensed style that's on movie posters everywhere.   \n   \nIf you'd like your credit as having a particular role in a movie, be it actor, director, art director, director of photography, screenwriter, etc. (just not producer -- that part's taken care of), let me know that too, and I'll accommodate you as best I can. Made-up roles are also welcome, though I can't guarantee I'll use them.   \n   \nA few lucky people will also have their names above the title, as they will be assigned roles of high-profile actors. (Sorry, I can't offer $20 million plus 20 percent of the back end to my name actors, just my undying thanks.) If you would like -- or not like -- to be one of those names, let me know.   \n   \nThanks -- hope to see you in my movie!\n\n",
