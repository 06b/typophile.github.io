Why is Horley absolutely never used?  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/horley-old-style/](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112200946/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/horley-old-style/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/horley-old-style/\")\n\nAt least I’d never heard about it before (I stumbled on it while searching for “Garalde” in Google) although I think it has some very worthwhile attributes; like look at that “g”! And the judicious vertical proportions. It was made by Pierport, and that immediately suggests to me that Morison was the cause of its persistent obscurity. For one thing, they could have just used that (at most having to make a short-extender version) instead of dreaming up Times New Roman! Amazing.\n\nhhp\n\n [‹ Who Designed the Fed Ex logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112200946/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28099 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What happened to these guys... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112200946/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19886 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Horley is a small town near to the Monotype works.\n\n_But it’s much less wonky and pokey._\n\nAs Tobias Frere-Jones said of Horley when he and Mike Parker and I were talking about it some years ago: it lacks Goudy’s ’wandering lumpiness’.\n\n"
