It could be narrower.\n\n2. ordinal in numero sign seems to be a zero, but it would be a superscript |o| because Nº abbreviates the word **N** umer **o**.\n\n3. section has a nice and original design, but I guess it would be considered too fancy or not easily recognizable in Law texts, where it is largely used.\n\n"
