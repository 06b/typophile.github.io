My first feeling was \"too many circles/bars to be a font\".  \nAnyway, pretty useless but here are some fonts I like for this one: [Trade Printer](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/trade-printer), [Two Cents](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/two-cents-plain), [Dezen Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dizajndesign/dezen-pro), [Wilma](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeotones/wilma), [Jean-Luc](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.carvalho-bernau.com/jlg), [Cornelia](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/novotypo/nt-cornelia), [Crimestopper](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/crimestopper), [Karben 105 Mono](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/talbot/karben-105-mono) and [Kessel 205](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/talbot/kessel-205), [Serenade](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/serenade), [Absender](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.dafont.com/absender.font), [Old Block](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.dafont.com/old-block.font), [Catorze27](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/scannerlicker/catorze27-style1)\n\n"

      "content": "The jet behind the singer looks like something from the late 50's or 60's. If the cover art was prepared then the font would probably have been photo-composition Note that the S seems out of alignment -- tilted left -- as if it had been poorly applied. If so, then the font was probably something sold by a French equivalent to Letraset. Noting Ryuk's search results, the font was probably never converted to digital.  \nThe font has a high waist and an N where the diagonal intersects halfway up the right hand stroke.  \nNT Cornelia has a similar N.  \nHigh waisted fonts were popular before 1900 but few have been digitized. There is at least one high waisted font, but it has serifs. This is [Eccentric](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/eccentric/) designed by Gustav F. Schroeder in 1881 and published by Adobe and others.  \nDon\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820073338im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Eccentric@Adobe_3476.jpg)\n  \nMyFonts blurb:  \n\"Eccentric is an all-capital, narrow-bodied, monoline display face that could be described as high waisted. With cross-bars and main junctures more than halfway up the letterforms, every letter - except the W - has a long-legged appearance.\"  \nDon \n"

In the 1950s, when you saw a dude with three days' beard and a jacket that didn't fit, he wasn't a pop star, he was a homeless guy.

      "content": "Well it was a stab in the dark. But you are right, in the 1950's and early 60s in the Anglosphere, almost everyone looked \"neat\" even pop singers. Was this also true of the Franco world? Or had the 5 day unshaven look already arrived? I defer to pop culture experts.  \nAs an alternative to photo-composition, the letters could have been selectively stretched in Illustrator or Photoshop to create a high waist effect.  \nAn easy font to make, which has with some appeal, as laurent's post indicates. I'm surprised that there seems to be nothing on the market, or released as an amateur creation.  \nDon\n\n"
