Which is the ideal size in mm and resolution for inserting / posting images?\n\n3. How do I post a PDF file in a thread (instead of an image - which is the default type)?\n\n4. I have sent a typeface for critiqe under a preliminary name (Thetis) and now I want to alter to another one (Semele) which is the final name, do I start a new thread under the final name? Do I contact the Typophile webmaster for that? What would you advise that I should do?\n\n",
