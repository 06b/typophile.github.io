  "content": "Hi masters of typography,  \nI’m quite a typo-fan, and a heavy user: now I have this brand new problem: a big fashion catalogue to be made in three languages, part in the italian office, and part in the moscow office. I choosed the “neosans, neotech” fonts from Monotype, but it does not have [cyrillic](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811125543/http:/typophile.com/wiki/cyrillic) fonts and even lacks of some accents used in the italian language.\n\nHave anybody of you just had the same problem: can you suggest me some fonts which could fit my needs? Anyway, if my english has been understandable (I think I have to practice!) please, can you help me with some advice?\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nBERGMAN\n\n [‹ Afro Clinic Card](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811125543/http:/typophile.com/node/19748 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [San-Serif with DIN's qualities? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811125543/http:/typophile.com/node/19750 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

And surprisingly quick.  \nI just checked Paratype.com, but Fontshop was a new suggestion.  \nI think I’ll choose a classic helvetica (or something like that) but I feel like the Fontshop (or the Myfonts) shops have just a limited offer of cyrillic fonts, a sort of “cyrillic fonts for tourists”, cause I’ve been recently in Russia and you can find there many and many fonts on magazines which resembles to western original (for example on “Esquire Russia”, or on “L’Optimum” which is much like the american man oriented “Details”) and a rich offer of graphic design. It simply does not communicates with us, unless we don’t speak russian.  \nAny clue about any forum like this, driven by russian graphics (but hopefully english speaking)? Or any russian graphic on the forum? Or elsewhere?\n\nI think this problem will increase in the near future for any western graphic designer. Maybe a non-western section could be a fine extention to this beloved website.\n\nGreetings from Italy\n\nBERGMAN\n\n"

I have to thank you for the attention you gave to my question, and I’m honored to talk to such experienced type lovers.\n\n- to Maxim Zhukov: Here on viale Gramsci we have many recipes on the way to our oven: we usually work on brand and retail projects, but recently we focused on this graphic design project in Moscow. My recipes always involve gestalt theories, so you can find gestalt almost anywhere, like garlic in italian cuisine! I’d like to put some of my garlic in russian recipes too (I hope It works).  \nWorking with russians I could compare cultures and see differences, but mostly I found unexpected human and professional qualities, I’ve seen a country which is growing rapidly and which is consciuous of It’s value. I often travel for work, and I worked on each side of the planet, but with Russia it’s been love at first sight.\n\n- to Alessandro Segalini: I don’t know what were they thinking when they create the Neo font, but it really lacks accents for normal use in italian (you can’t write “è la mia città”), in french, and so on.  \nThanks for your font suggestions, but the client likes Neo, so I should work on this font. I found that many publishers use their customized version of Neo, and I’m thinking to walk that way. Thank you (I suppose we can talk in italian, but It could not be fair for the community here on typophile).\n\n- to Danya: I’m taking Russian language lessons but fortunately I can rely on translators when I am in Moscow, cause I’m in a ridicolous early stage of learning! I’ll contact you. Thank you very much.\n\n"

      "content": "When deciding on a Cyrillic to nicely match a Latin, the one thing I would recommend (not least because virtually nobody else will) is to end up with a setup where the Cyrillic “x-height” is slightly larger than the Latin x-height. This is anti-conventional, but to me critical (at least in running text, although not in display) since it helps equalize the apparent sizes (because Cyrillic has far fewer extenders). One problem though is that you generally can’t simply use a difference in point sizes (within most any “canned” Latin+Cyrillic family) to do this, since the color balance will shift.
