      "content": "The Palatino Linotype one looks like it is an afterthought, like a diacritic pasted on top of the letterforms, although it’s not too bad on the lowercase e. I can understand why it sticks out to the left of the lowercase a, but it would have been better to properly incorporate it with the inside of the serif. On the uppercase i it’s oddly off center, but seems okay on the lowercase i.\n\nThe URW Palladio ogonek looks like it was taken from Verdana or some other sans serif font. It’s totally out of place. It looks especially weird on both upper and lowercase i, it should have been visually centered instead.\n\nThe ogonek of URW Palladio L is particularly vile with its foreign shape and poking out to the left. It’s also far too small, and far too spindly. Easily missed in reading.\n\nHas anyone else noticed that the ogonek in TeX Pagella seems to be a tweaked chunk of the terminal of the lowercase a? It’s nicely long and dark, easily seen. It needs a little bit more work, but I like it.\n\nThe Palatino Nova ogonek looks spindly and weak, out of proportion with the heaviness of the stems. It also looks pasted on, or rather tacked on the edge. The juncture between it and the letterforms is too thin, which is what seems to be causing this. Also, the angle of departure is very narrow, and doesn’t harmonize with the pen angle elsewhere.\n\nAlthough I don’t read Polish, I do work with Tlingit and the Athabaskan languages where the ogonek (U+0328) is frequently used in various orthographies to represent nasalized vowels. Unlike in Polish, in the Athabaskan languages it can occur on all five orthographic vowels: ą (U+0105), į (U+012F), ų (U+0173), ę (U+0119), ǫ (U+01EB). Also unlike Polish, it often occurs with acute and grave accents, for example ę́ (U+0119 U+0301). Since long vowels are usually represented with pairs of letters, it’s common to see sequences like ę́ę́ and ǫ́ǫ́. A particularly nasty problem is with į́ (U+012F U+0301) or į̀ (U+012F U+0300), where the tittle is never properly removed. To get this to work one usually must abuse the dotless ı (U+0131) like so: ı̨́ (U+0131 U+0328 U+0301). Of course none of this will display correctly here given the typically lousy state of support for such characters.\n\n"

Somewhere I found a mention that Lithuanian used a slightly different standard for its appearance, but I couldn't find out what it was.\n\nAlso, when this is used with American Indian languages, _then_ the usual approach is to center it below the letter, so for those languages it might be considered a separate accent (although, at least in Polish, the ogonek is not treated as an accent; instead, the letter with the ogonek is a new member of the alphabet).\n\nI wanted to see what the ogonek looked like in older typefaces, so I tried searching for a Polish-language dictionary on Google Books. At first, I had no success, so I changed my search terms. I ended up finding a book for learning the Polish language written in Hebrew (or, perhaps more likely, Yiddish) which had title pages in Russian and Polish in addition to the language in which the book was written. (\"Grammatyka polska, w języku żydowsko-niemieckiem\", my first result when I searched on public-domain only on the word Polska... as different books are available with such a search in the U.S., U.S. searchers may have different results.)\n\nA book from 1883, for Jews in Russia, on how to learn Polish - presumably so they could move to Poland to escape the risk of pogroms in Tsarist Russia.

Next step is conecting the ogonek to the remaining letters.

In the \"A\" and \"a\" the idea was to tilt/lift the serif, like a foot, off the baseline, which makes it flat on top and slanted on the bottom (and then let that slant extend into the ogonek); the serif isn't being distorted or enlarged, it's just flipped.  \nThe situation in the \"E\" is different in that the structure of the base glyph is not changed with the addition of the ogonek (which does bother me a bit).\n\n"

      "content": "BTW, the \"original\" glyph to which the ogonek attaches is the \"e\", because the letter \"ę\" is actually the Latin letter _e caudata_, which in the Middle Ages was an alternative way of writing _æ_. Later, when the Latin spelling standardized on using _æ_ and later just _ae_, the _e caudate_ letter was repurposed by the Polish to denote the nasalized _e_.\n\nClaude Garamond's Gros Canon includes a really beautiful _e caudata_ which works 100% as the Polish _ę_ today: [(my image on Flickr)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417201806/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/adamt/3630379481/).\n\nThe _cauda_ or _ogonek_ (tail) was later added to the other letters in Polish, and later in Lithuanian. But I still find that the form that merges with _e_ is the key, and for me always the origin. In handwriting, _ę_ is written in one move, as a kind of \"two semi-loops\". This is why for calligraphic designs, I usually try to replicate the curvature and the endine of the bottom part of _e_ in the ogonek. The top part of the ogonek is usually a somewhat flat curve. In Palatino, I tend to make it a bit flatter than in other typefaces, because you have lots of those \"sudden flat curves\" as in the bottom part of the Roman _a_ bowl.\n\nIn more constructed typefaces, especially those with a small aperture (i.e. where the glyphs _c_ or _e_ are rather closed), the ogonek cannot be drawn in one stroke with the _e_ (e.g. in Univers). Then, it is usually not so \"closed\" either, and can be placed more freely, e.g. a bit more towards the middle of the letter as in Łukasz Dziedzic's FF Good:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417201806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ogonek_ffgood_6254.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Chris,\n\ngenerally, if you take a very abstract view on the ogonek and imagine that it's a part of a circle (which of course it isn't, but just very broadly), then you have the liberty to take various \"slices\" of the circle: 2/3 of a circle would be the fullest, 1/2 of the circle is quite common, and 1/3 or even 1/4 of the circle are shorter. Here's this idea:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417201806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ogonek_skeleton_5803.png)\n\nOf course in fact, it's not part of a circle but of a calligraphic, oblique ellipse:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417201806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ogonek_skeleton_oblique_4797.png)\n\nThe size of the ogonek on the left is exagerrated (for the sake of comparison), and it's very basic skeletons, but the principle stands.\n\n"

      "content": "Chris, in your examples, #1 and #2 work, but #3 and #4 I feel are too complex, The proportions are too exagerrated into the horizontal. I generally prefer ogoneks that are somewhat within the proportions (height-to-width aspect ratio) of the base letters, preferrably \"neutral\" lowercase (i.e. such as \"a\" or \"n\"). If you look at the image below:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417201806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ogonek_proportions1_3445.png)\n\nI've marked with grey the area that the \"a\" glyph would take. The \"e\" is typically wider than the \"a\". So an ogonek that has the same aspect ratio as the \"a\" or as the \"e\" usually works well. If it's too narrow (like the red ones on the left) or too wide (like the red ones on the right), then it starts looking strange.\n\nOf course, the actual \"scaling factor\" between the base lowercase body and the ogonek body depends very much on the descenders. If they're short, you need to compress more. In the example above, the condensed letters (in the top row) would in reality unlikely have so long descenders, so some downscaling compensation would apply, as described below.\n\nHere's an image that shows the lowercase x-height body (darker gray), the ascenders and descenders zones (lighter gray) and the ogonek \"zone\":\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417201806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ogonek_proportions2_4830.png)\n\nJust like with optical sizing, if you scale down more, you have to widen a bit (that's the downscaling compensation I'm talking about). So if the descenders are quite long compared to the x-height, then the ogonek can be fairly long and then generally maintain the height-to-width ratio of the neutral lowercase letters. If the descenders are very short, so the ogonek needs to be scaled down a lot to fit into the descender zone, then it can be relatively a bit wider, but not too wide. If you make it too wide, the deviation of the aspect ratio between the main body of the letters and the ogoneks becomes too distracting. And that's what is happening in Chris's #2 and #3 examples, I think.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n"

The aogonek comes in three levels of integration with the main form, the rightmost one being merely taken from the eogonek and laid on the a. For the Eogonek, I tried to somewhat hint at the line leading over to the serif, but because it is a slab, I can't lead off from the left side of it as in some of the examples posted...\n\nThe q is included to show you the descender line.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417201806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Albuquerque_ogoneks_3470.gif)\n\n"
