I love how the main part of the title, \"Shooter\", is in the scope of a sniper rifle. It relates perfectly to what the story is about instead of a random image that could be misleading like some covers out there. Overall, I think it's just really cool and well put together.\n\nAfter I found the audio book, I decided to look online to see if there was also a regular book. Below are the images I found to go with it:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629082046im_/http:/typophile.com/files/20060401-shooter_5576.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629082046im_/http:/typophile.com/files/354275_4102.jpg)\n\nI think both images are good book covers, but I like the first one better. I find the \"big ball of sun\" to wash out the colors in the image of the second one.\n\n",
