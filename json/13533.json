Designing at his home office near, appropriately, Fonthill, Ontario, he now works on fonts full-time. \"I'm lucky to be doing something I enjoy everyday,\" is how he describes himself. His wife, Rina, runs the business, writes ad copy and creates graphics for his new font releases.\n\n[http://www.typodermic.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001011/http:/www.typodermic.com/ \"http://www.typodermic.com/\")\n\n",
