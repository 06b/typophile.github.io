I played an important part in the life drama that has for aim and goal the complete perfection of Man's nature. Through my influence, the human nature has been raised, mitigated and sharpened. With men's help I became an Art. I have a multiplicity of voices and instruments.   \n   \nI stand in the heart of all men and on their tongues in all the lands,   \namong all the people; the ignorant and the illiterate know me as the rich and the scholar do because I speak to all men in a language they all understand. Even the deaf can hear me if he only listens the voice of his soul. I am the food of love. I taught men mildness and peace and I guided them towards heroic acts. I give comfort to the lonely and I harmonize the discord of the crowds. I am a necessary luxury for all men. I am Music.   \n   \nAnonymous\n\n"

There's lots of stuff.   \nSome interesting covers I remember:   \n- Coalchamber covering Peter Gabriel ('Shock The Monkey'),   \n- Get Up Kids (not my cup of tea, but anyway) covering New Order ('Regret') / The Cure ('Close To Me'),   \n- Teenage Fanclub covering Madonna ('Like A Virgin'),   \n- Lemonheads covering Suzanne Vega ('Luka'),   \n- Chicks On Speed covering B-52s,   \n- The Presidents Of USA covering The Buggles ('Video Killed The Radio Star'),   \n- Crash Test Dummies covering XTC ('Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead', originally released in '92, but anyway, it's a good song),   \n- Smashing Pumpkins covering Alice Cooper ('Clones'), etc.\n\n"
