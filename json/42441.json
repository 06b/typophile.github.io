All I can contribute is that there’s [Stiletto](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424142847/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/stiletto/) by URW++ (Designer: Ralph M. Unger) – that looks very similar. And then there’s [Adieu](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424142847/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/adieu/) by David Bergsland; also quite close. He claims that “Adieu is an old-fashioned display font traced and modified from a group of Victorian fonts.”\n\nF\n\n"
