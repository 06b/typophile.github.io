Along the way Gill didn't know for sure if this would be the typeface he would release. He had another offer from another company for her sister font, Felicity. The time, scheduling, and mismanagement worked out in Perpetua's favor.\n\nGill named her after Saint Perpetua who was one of the first martyrs to die for Christianity. It took nearly 8 years of meticulous work to to be able to produce such a beautiful typeface to suit such an honorable woman. In the end he produced a masterpiece that is still unique and timeless today.\n\nKnowing Saint Perpetua's story as well as the sketchy business related background that went into this typeface, I had to share its story as well as choose it as my favorite.\n\n",

But I will look into the Roman style named after a man.  \nThank you,  \nJessica\n\n"
