The basic idea behind it all is create a font that will—via script–generate the outlines of each glyph that is typed. So if a user were to type one line, erase it and then type the same line afterwards, the glyphs would come out completely different.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330212053im_/http:/typophile.com/files/aaaargh_4846.png)\n\nThis is why the working title for this font is “Aaaargh!!”.\n\n",
