  "content": "I have to typeset a bunch of stuff bilingual in German and English at the moment and have some questions (which weren't entirely answered in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224080328/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20924.html?1069454997)). All help appreciated.   \n   \nN.B. -- this could be complicated by the fact that the audience is Swiss (Basel), and I understand there are some peculiarities there regarding the use of guillemets instead of the standard German quote marks ... anyway:   \n   \n1) My particular concerns are the citing of the titles of artworks, books etc. In English, I set titles of works, books, films etc. italic, and I set titles of exhibitions, journals, articles etc. in single quotes.   \n   \nEverything (like, everything I mentioned above) in the translated texts I've received seems to be set in double German quotes (with the 'low nines' left and 'high sixes' right), which make the page very gappy. Is it familiar/acceptable to use italics or single quotes for any of these purposes in German?   \n   \n2) With ref to the Swiss thing, I've read that it's common in Switzerland to use guillemets instead of quotes. But would that be the German ones (facing 'inwards') or the French style (facing 'outwards')? And only for speech, or for the things I mentioned above also? I guess the intent is that German, Italian and French texts are set the same way?   \n   \nSorry to be so dumb. I promise I've ordered a copy of Der Duden (see link above). But it's going to take 4-6 weeks to arrive.   \n   \nRob\n\n",

      "content": "If you read my previews text, it have all the info you need. ;-)   \n   \nThe Italic thing is ok, but don't use single quotes (out of the double quotes content) in a professional text. If you find it ugly, guillemets are quite good in German too and its common for your Swiss audience. But note the difference in the directions for the German usage of guillemets. ;-)   \n   \nIf you have to deal with other languages too, you should prefer the guillemets.   \n   \nBTW. The Duden is a German only book. An english version like the Oxford-Duden German Dictionary should you serve better - but its only a thought.\n\n"
