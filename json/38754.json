Many thanks in advance for more information!\n\n",

I wonder if she doesn't consider her self more of a lettering artist. Although if the research involves a specific typeface . . .\n\n"

Are there more?\" So I named a few others (including Beatrice Warde, who was not a type designer but was a key figure in the development of 20th-century type), and we talked about the imbalance.\n\nI also recall noticing, at a FUSE conference in London in 90-something, that the majority of the audience was women, while the preponderance of the presenters was men. How come that didn't translate, over the past ten years or so, into a much larger number of women at the top of the graphic-design field? (Well, all right, the pressures and the reasons are obvious, but still. But still.)\n\n"

The role-model didn't change really since that time. To be patient is not sooo easy ;-)\n\n"
