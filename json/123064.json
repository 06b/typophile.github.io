  "content": "Hey there! I´m in a conflict with the selection of the typeface for a project that I need to do. The project is to design a light bulb pack. We already have the design of the pack me and my colleague. I can attach you some samples that I did but I´m not totally convinced though of the result. The style is a bit minimalistic I could say.  \nFeel free to make any suggestions.\n\nThanks,Orestis\n\n",

I imagine you've submitted now, but it might be good to put the specification numbers (lumens, watts etc.) into lining figures as this is normal on technical specifications for headings. Also, I would reset the shadow effect for \"MM\" so that the 'shadows' aren't separated from the letters that are supposed to be casting them.\n\n"
