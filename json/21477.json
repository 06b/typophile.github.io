Hey, it was old school, but it worked brilliantly. Is there something similar available now for Mac OSX?\n\nIdeally, I would like to gang up 12 or more specimens per page. It would be fantastic if I didn’t have to activate fonts to print them, but I’m aware that might be asking too much.\n\nI look forward to reading your suggestions.\n\nTIA-  \ncheers-  \nKayt\n\n",
