  "content": "My wife finally talked me in taking her to Paris this summer.\n\nSomewhere between the Louvre and Sacre Coeur we stumbled on to the **[Galeries Lafayette](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108072234/http:/www.galerieslafayette.com/)**, a giant unbelievably luxurious french department store. I was shocked to see the place was just dripping with the font Ashby that I designed several years ago. It was used on just about every sign and banner and display in the place.\n\n**[Ashby](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108072234/http:/www.woodardworks.com/type02b.html)** is the second font I ever created. When I couldn't get anybody to distribute it, I let it go free. With no EULA or anything -- like a big dummy.\n\nEven though I'm the designer, I had never really seen it in use so much. It does look pretty good for the most part. But I see now it has a lot of silly errors. When I was working on it, I was obsessing on making the whole thing completely evenly weighted and I really could have used better judgement that I didn't possess at the time. Even the accents are the same stroke weight as the glyphs and that looks pretty funky especially when set in French.\n\nThe Galeries seem to be a serious business so I am surprised to see them using a free font off the web so heavily. But If they are going to use it like that, I would love to work out a pro version of Ashby for them that looks a little more professional. And maybe not quite so free.\n\nAny ideas on how to get hold of their art department? And somebody who hopefully speaks english??\n\n",
