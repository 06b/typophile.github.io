  "content": "Hi all\n\nI am presently putting together a proposal for a museum exhibition on the intersections of type design and national identity. The era I have in mind spans from the end of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth (essentially the era dominated by production for Monotype/Linotype machines).\n\nI am looking for two kinds of ideas: suggestions of appropriate “case studies” that fit the theme; and suggestions of what types of “objects” might make for an engaging exhibition of historical type design.\n\nFor the case studies, I already have some ideas in mind, such as  \n- Norwegian identity and Gerhard Munthe’s revival of medieval lettering  \n- Koch and the modern German blackletter  \n- Gill’s Sans as against nationalism and internationalism  \n- modernization and standardization efforts in Weimar Germany (with an eye to international markets)  \n- the changing Nazi policy on blackletter  \n- Frutiger and Swiss design education  \n- Zapf’s Palatino and the meaning of Italian Renaissance at midcentury  \n- Goudy, Dwiggins, and the development of an American type design\n\nFor the objects, any suggestions are welcome. I am sure I could display books that show some of the types at issue. I also think it’d be nice to show a linotype slug or the like, if I can get my hands on one. I’ll particularly be looking into local (Twin Cities, MN) special-collections libraries for exhibitable material.\n\nI appreciate all input you can offer on both of these questions. Thanks in advance.\n\nCraig.\n\n [‹ Graphic Artists Guild, is there a uk equivalent?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120080114/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28330 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Decorated capital S ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120080114/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28325 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The championing of sans for text—which was neither German nor the custom elsewhere—was an important part of this. And so was the effort at being ’neutral’. If you compare Futura and Goudy Sans you have a very striking difference in direction. So I think the anti-nationalism thing would be an interesting contrary note in the exhibition.\n\n"

[Paul Renner and Futura: The Effects of Culture, Technology, and Social Continuity On the Design of Type for Printing](http://web.archive.org/)  \nAs you may well be aware, the series Weimar and Now of the University of California press is explicitly directed at taking the historical lessons be learned from the Weimar republic and bringing them forward to illuminate the events of our own era. One or the more typographic significant events of that period was the development of Futura. In his 1922 book _Typografie als Kunst,_ Paul Renner wrote the words shown in the attached samples as the concluding sentence of the first paragraph of the chapter of the history of European letterforms.  \nThe words must have been of utmost significance to Renner because they also appeared in a test proof from 1927, are paraphrased in _Mechanisierte Grafik,_ and are in quoted in full in a brief memoir—”Vom Georg-Müller-Buch bis zur Futura und Meisterschule: Erinnerungen Paul Renners aus dem Jahrzent von 1918 bis 1927”. _Imprimatur: ein Jahrbuch für Bücherfreunde,_ 9, 1939/1940—where Renner quotes the entire passage and states the quote was in his mind as he began the design of Futura in 1924.  \nIt is my personal feeling that is the most telling written and typographical statement of Renner’s goals for Weimar typography, and an apt inclusion in any exhibition of typography in that period.  \nThe first image is a trial cut of Futura as shown in F.H. Ehmcke’s _Schrift: irhe Gestaltung und Entwicklung in neuerer Zeit._ As reproduced in Burke, “The Authorship of Futura,”  \n_baseline_ No. 23 1997.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120080114im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/EhmckeFuturasample.jpg)\n  \nThe Second is a proof print of Futura Light, 24 point type Bauer  \ntypefoundry.

He was trying to accomplish what one century earlier Unger had done with his “neo-classic” Fraktur, applying a Western-European style to fundamentaly German forms. Of course Renner abandoned the enlarged minuscule and uncial capitals of fraktur and replaced them with Roman capitals and then applied the geometric logic of roman capitals to the definition of the lowercase characters. He was indeed trying for an international font, but an international style that included forms familiar to German readers rather than simply accepting the Western-European roman as the norm.  \nIt is more accurate to think of Renner, named by his clerical father after the Apostle Paul and friend to Thomas Mann, as a “Christian Socialist” than as an international socialist.  \nThe following is how the quote appeared in 1922 set in Unger Fraktur.

The Latin script was taken as a token of Croatian nationalism, along with the Catholic religion, contra the Cyrillic script and Orthodoxy of the Serbs. The Croats were also keen to exploit any linguistic differentiation they could find, and there were efforts to reform Croatian spelling on phonetical lines (as there had been during the fascist period) in order to differentiate it from Serbian spelling (prior to this, the same Serbo-Croatian text could be displayed in either script simply by switching fonts with parallel 8-bit Latin and Cyrillic encoding). There was also a proposal to remove all words of Serbian origin from official use, and there was a famous example of the nationalist politician who made this proposal giving a speech on television which then had to be dubbed for rebroadcast to remove all the Serbian word he had used. I remember at the time meeting Croatian nationalists in Canada who were insistent that Croatian and Serbian were totally different, mutually unintelligible languages. But I have yet to meet a Serb who couldn’t carry on a conversation with a Croat.\n\nIn the tighter and bloodier context of Bosnia, it was the Bosnian Serb nationalists who saw their Cyrillic script as a tangible symbol of their distinct identity.

Your calligraphic syllabics have some interesting features, but they don’t represent the visual culture of the Inuktitut script in any way. They would create the wrong impression for Italians seeing the logo and not knowing anything else about the Inuktitut writing system. So I can see why the Inuit advisors would reject them for that purpose. Would they reject them in other circumstances? When he was on one of his trips to Iqaluit, Ross drew a few quite flamboyant cursive syllabics to encourage people to try thinking about their writing system in new ways. The general reaction wasn’t negative: people were interested but non-commital.\n\nGetting back to the subject of the thread: a writing system can be an important cultural identifier for a group of people, whether they constitute a nation in a political sense or not. If they are a minority group within a larger culture, seeking to preserve their distinct identity and foster their heritage, they tend to be protective and hence conservative about their script.

Such is the case with Armenian, since most Armenians don’t live in Armenia. This is one of the points I emphasize, that the directions a script should take depends on the needs and desires of its users - it is attuned to politics much more than the personal aesthetic preferences of the designer.\n\nBut this does not mean innovation can’t occur - it just has to be “internal”, and careful. Sometimes it even needs to be consciously unlike the Big Brother’s script; so making the Inuit script look like it was made by an Italian scribe 500 years ago is not only misleading, but culturally endangering. Better to look for inspiration from whale bone carving, or even biology or mathematics.\n\nhhp\n\n"

But type designers shouldn’t be led by the conservatism of the ignorant, not least because such conservatism may easily be misplaced. It takes less than one generation for readers to get used to a particular or limited set of type styles, or to the output of particular typesetting technologies which may have significant technical limitations, and then to mistakenly cling to these as being ’correct’, in the process abandoning huge swathes of the history, evolution and variety of their writing system. I remember, Hrant, your comment regarding the excellent _Album of Armenian Palaeography,_ which you were pleased would provide evidence that forms which modern readers might find peculiar are part of the heritage of the script.

I’m not as much of an expert as Hrant is kind enough to suggest (and a big hello to you too Hrant) but as you both know, I’m working on it.\n\nThe presence of your mass of ignorant conservatives implies that somewhere there is a smaller population of open-minded, enlightened technicians. I would argue that this is not always the case.\n\nIn Ireland, for example, “enlightened” typographers (Morison and Ó Loclainn, for example) only took an interest in Gaelic type after it had already become officially (as far as the government was concerned) obselete. For the four centuries before that, the shape of Irish letters in print was an instrument of the invader, the Church, and various types of nationalists, none of whom had the first clue about type design.\n\nResistance did exist but in parallel manuscript form rather than in conflict with the printed letter.\n\nA second point on the “less than one generation” timescale. I’ve recently developed a fascination with Mustapha Kemal’s alphabet reform in Turkey and am currently working with one of my students on a comparison with the Irish typographic reform of the 1960s. In both cases it is clear that when the reading public is given no choice (they don’t generally publish their own reading material), they can adapt practically overnight. During the perios of transition (only a few years) Irish schoolbooks contained chapters in both scripts, for example. The government published the books and the people did what they were told.

Old habits die hard and I do like a good debate ;-).\n\nI would be delighted to discuss ways of including Irish Gaelic Type in your exhibition proposal. It would be a shame to leave it out of your scope as printing type has always been an extremely politically charged issue in Ireland.\n\nI will take this opportunity to also manetion a bit of a scandal. The Irish government (ignorant conservatives to a man/woman) have just permitted a “celebration” of the 90th anniversary of the 1916 rising against British rule in the form of a public auction of historical documents from this period.\n\n[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern\\_ireland/4889982.stm](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120080114/http:/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4889982.stm \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern\\_ireland/4889982.stm\")\n\nOnce again our print heritage is being shipped out of the country to the foreign universities with the biggest budgets while we do our utmost to keep a lock of Napoleon Bonaparte’s hair safe and sound on our island:\n\n[http://archives.tcm.ie/waterfordnews/2005/12/02/story20109.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120080114/http:/archives.tcm.ie/waterfordnews/2005/12/02/story20109.asp \"http://archives.tcm.ie/waterfordnews/2005/12/02/story20109.asp\")\n\nPrint history is perhaps better off left to the people. The experts are often more interested in hard currency. In Ireland, at least.\n\nI obviously still like a good rant.\n\nM.\n\n"

A recent edition was published here in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, with fratur fonts that are very similar to those Cristopher Saur fonts ...similar to Monotype Durer which has also been used for Amish printing recently.\n\nToday, American folk art collectors think of folk paintings when they think of the word “fraktur.” A red “fraktur” alligator, with manuscript fraktur lettering, recently sold for $119,000 at auction.\n\nMaybe you could borrow that alligator for your exhibit.\n\nLee Jay Stoltzfus  \nRarebooknews.com\n\n"
