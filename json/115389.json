  "content": "Hello!\n\nIt's my first time here, so I'll quickly introduce myself: I'm Carel Fransen, graphic designer from the Netherlands, and currently working on my graduation projects.\n\nFor my project, I'm looking for a quality condensed font with a large x-height that does great at small corps-sizes (approx. 6-7 pt).\n\nI have got one font that works very well: [Bureau Grot Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713092314/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bureau-grot/light/). However, I'd like to have some options. Unfortunately, due to the \"advanced search\"-mechanisms on big font-sites not being that advanced, it's nearly impossible to search for something this specific.\n\nI hope that some of you might be able to give me some recommendations. Preferably, I'd like a font with some Opentype-features like different kinds of figures, but most importantly it should be a bit condensed, readable at small sizes, and kerned nicely.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nKind regards,\n\nCarel\n\n",
