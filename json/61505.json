  "content": "Hi, I stumbled across this forum and find it fascinating, although I have absolutely no training in design/aesthetics. Can you please give me your criticism on a logo I’m playing around with for my new venture?\n\nI looking for a logo that is clean and simple (many clients use English as a 2nd language), yet indicates achievement (particularly scholastic achievement).\n\nPlease be brutally honest, but dumb down any specialized vocabulary for this novice. In particular, are there any rules for character spacing and sizing? It seems I have a lot of problems in that area.\n\nThank you,\n\nEMS\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [BTN Logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905081017/http:/typophile.com/files/BTN%20Logo.jpg) | 53.82 KB |\n\n",

Learn about them at [http://www.andyrutledge.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905081017/http:/www.andyrutledge.com/ \"http://www.andyrutledge.com/\"). This is a must-read in my eyes. Nevertheless I think that my dirty illustration shows the biggest problems.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905081017im_/http:/typophile.com/files/star_4842.jpg)\n  \n  \n  \nConcerning typography ... did you draw the letters? If not, forget about sizing and concentrate on kerning (space between one and another character). In my opinion the characters themselves are to thin to be so close to each other. I think with a bolder font the connection between ’s’ and ’t’ and as a result the overall tightness of the two words might work better. Maybe you could also connect ’e’ and ’s’ then.  \n  \nThe capital ’T’ from Test looks like a small-cap ’t’ though it doesn’t look like the other ones ... this kind of confusses me.  \n  \nThe dash between Best and Test looks like an en-dash which would be a mistake in this context so I’d suggest to make it shorter and look more like a typical hyphen.  \n  \nSome personal taste at the end. For some reason I dislike the font in general. Maybe bolder and better kerned (maybe on the same baseline) would improve it and make it work for me but I would try another one ... but as I mentioned this is my personal taste. I do really like the font you’ve used for ’.net’ but you’d maybe try to get it a little tighter (especially the dot).\n"

This is is very helpful.\n\nriccard0: What do you mean by “the type on Best-Test is too light compared with the surrounding strokes” — which strokes are you referring to?\n\nSimplicious: Thank you for the link for the star. Will definitely check it out and rework it. I did not draw the letters. The font is called “Unispace” — I was looking for a modern style font. I did adjust the size/width of the “B” and “t” and the kerning just by my untrained eyeballs. Yes, the “t” is an enlarged version of a lowercase one. I wanted to emphasize the first letter without making it a capital letter. I guess it doesn’t work well. Also thanks for the hyphen comment. I knew there is something wrong with it.\n\nThe “.net” font is called “Bauer,” as in the skate manufacturer. I was trying to make it look modern overall, and wanted to space out the “.net” to better balance with the above “Best-test” — perhaps this doesn’t work well.\n\nThanks again you both for the quick responses.\n\n"

I actually decreased the width of the “B” (I think it was 70% of actual width).\n\nAlso, I read your article on Gestalt Principles. Very interesting, but I don’t understand what it means I should do with the widths of the two stars. (I was just trying to make the shape more interesting/forward leaning.)

The hyphen should probably be a bit thicker and the lower right of the star seems a little too thick, the way that it flares out is leading my eye away from the logo.\n\nJust my opinion but I think it’s definitely an improvement on the original!\n\n"
