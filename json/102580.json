  "content": "I've completed the installation of FDK + the Macro installation successfully...\n\nBut when I go and run the \"Autohint\" macro (and some others too), I get:  \n\"The script cannot run the command-line program 'autohintexe.exe'. Please make sure the AFDKO is installed, and the system environment variable PATH contains the path the to FDK sub-directory containing 'autohintexe.exe'.\"\n\nI run the Autohint in a command window and it worked, so the FDK is installed OK. I hae a 2.4 version of python, running on Windows 8 64bits.\n\nThen I tried to put the source folder in the macro, but it still throws some imposiblruuu output.\n\nAny ideas? I've cheked other typophile posts, and the adobe documentation, but no answer...\n\n",
