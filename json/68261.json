  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm working on a legacy mark to commemorate the 25th anniversary for a St. Louis arts organization. Out of several options, here's the direction my client picked. It's loosely based on Bodoni and Benton Modern.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012181708im_/http:/typophile.com/files/25th_logo_4210.png)\n\nIf anyone could offer some input on how to improve the curves, I'd really appreciate it. Some areas don't feel quite right yet, particularly in the way the swashes above and below cradle the shapes of the numbers.\n\nFeedback much appreciated.\n\n",

And which parts of the 5 seem misaligned? I'm not sure I follow.\n\n"
