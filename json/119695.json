  "content": "Hello :)  \nI am rebranding myself as I am going freelance in 3 weeks.  \nI am looking for a combination of fonts for my new website.  \nI love the font Simplifica: [http://freetypography.com/2014/03/24/free-font-simplifica/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317190421/http:/freetypography.com/2014/03/24/free-font-simplifica/ \"http://freetypography.com/2014/03/24/free-font-simplifica/\")  \nbut it only has one weight (light). Do you know of a nice font that would go with it for titles. I thought of Serifa but not quite right, its a bit too harsh but something along those lines. Or nexa slab.  \nthanks so much for your help.\n\nisabelle\n\n",
