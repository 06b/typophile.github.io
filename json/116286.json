  "content": "Hey,  \nIt seems to me that Hebrew is the most geometric font in the world, followed by Latin. How so?  \n(1) Well, we know that Aleph is composed of two Yuds - one high and one low. If we join them using a horizontal  \nrather than a diagonal we get a wind handle. Then reversing we get Lamed. I.e. Lamed=-Aleph  \nSimilarly, (2) Daled is not really a door but a detonation handle - hence Delet=hole in wall=\"Delete\". I.e. the hole in the concept of Daled is not in the innards of the letter\n\n",

And it's interesting that its sister, Arabic, is the other way around.\n\nhhp\n\n"
