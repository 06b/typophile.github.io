I’ve always found the description “Typefaces on the chopping block” misleading, it was years before I realized there were the categories: “Logo / Corporate ID” and “Typography / Composition” buried there. I thought that Critique was about type design only. Personally I’d rather see those two topics under “Design” instead.\n\n"
