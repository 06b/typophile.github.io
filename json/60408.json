Sure, perhaps we didn't surface our biographies to the \"monstrosity\" that is our home page, but this site is about the people who make up the larger community, not about us.\n\nI'm actually very interested in the discussion that you propose, but I must remind you that we are not MetaFilter and do not try to be. There are a number of ways we can enhance the site - we know this - and we'd like to find ways to make it a better experience for everyone (finding the time is our biggest obstacle). As a matter of fact, for months now we have been re-designing and building what will eventually become Typophile 2.0, or 3.0 - or whatever version we are on :)\n\n\\_William: Unfortunately Books has not gotten the attention it deserves in recent years, but it is still linked under \"Resources.\"\n\n"
