So if you ever wondered how these sketches were always so neat and perfect, that’s why.\"\n\nI can't leave this uncommented. How about other type designers here? It's frankly not true at all in my case. I don't start a new design with anything but ideas and pencil/paper. I'm always sketching. Once an idea starts taking shape, there can be many, many re-drawings of key characters before any digitization takes place. It's the way I'm most comfortable working because I have done a lot of drawing and lettering. And most of those pages don't look either neat or perfect. Is that what people really expect, or want, to see?\n\nIf publications want to see early stage material of a typeface, it is likely that the designer is reluctant to show them, because often the early drawings, and even several iterations of proofs, can look unflatteringly rough, half-baked and even unrecognizable. Carter has said that he doesn't feel comfortable with the drawing stage and does very little drawing. It's just one way to work, and clearly it's a viable one. But I don't think a generalization can be made from that.\n\n"

It's an easy way of documenting small problems that you want to correct.\n\nOf course, there is also a difference between a corrections sheet and sketches.

Fonts, on the other hand, either ‘have always been around’, or are ‘spit out by some computer program, if you just hit the right button’.\n\nThe sketch is an icon, a piece of evidence for the tedious and sophisticated process of type design – and the human mind (even better: the human hand) that has been involved in it.\n\nWhile novels might not be promoted with showings of edited manuscripts, their authors are very often depicted [in the act of writing](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201054433/http:/cubaa.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/cocktail-called-hemingway/), or with their tool – be it a [pen](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201054433/http:/blogs.walkerart.org/design/files/2009/03/paul_auster.jpg) or a [typewriter](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201054433/http:/quadri.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/much-ado-about-nothing-nihilism-and-modernist-literature-part-3-of-4/).

However, if you show someone else’s comments you’d be saying: “Well, I am not that good, but fortunately an expert looked at my errors”. If the corrections are done by the type designer himself, I certainly perceive them as a sign of careful handcrafting.\n\n"
