      "content": "Thanks Ryuk, for mentioning my previous comment on the lettering on the sheet music cover being hand done. I should have repeated my observation that everything on the cover is lithographed or engraved.  \nNone of the fonts mentioned are an exact match and most are much too wide, except for Spire and possibly Bordeaux.  \nIf anyone wants to compare the sheet music cover to Ian Party's Grazia and L'Officiel, note that the links mentioned no longer work, but a specimen of Grazia can be seen at [http://typecache.com/Ian\\_Party/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073422/http:/typecache.com/Ian_Party/ \"http://typecache.com/Ian\\_Party/\") The website [http://www.ianparty.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073422/http:/www.ianparty.com/ \"http://www.ianparty.com/\") is not currently available.  \nDon\n\n"
