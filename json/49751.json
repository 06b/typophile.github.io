  "content": "Hi guys,  \nI'm kinda creatively stuck and can't seem to find a good solution, so I thought I might ask youm, the experts.  \nI have a website that I'm putting together very minimal, the main copy is Arial and I'm looking for a nice simple preferably sans serif font for menus and headlines to go with it. the website is fashion oriented so I'm trying to find something that has personality. I was also considering Slabserif (Jubilat or Archer) but my preference is really sans.  \nDo you have any thoughts or ideas as to what could work? it should also have different weights and italics as well as being CE or multilingual.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated :)\n\nThank you,  \nMichal\n\n",
