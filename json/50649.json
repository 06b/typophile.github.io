The bad news: all glyphs are PUA, so they need either renaming, or cheating with Unicode values to get them working. Or this can be done via opentype, replacing for example the bullet symbol from all aperture glyphs (which should display a glyph selection palette). But believe me, this can become quite messy... So, Luc, any ideas?\n\n"

I don't want to start calling symbols \"a\" that do not represent  \nthe glyph \"a\" just because it is technically convenient.  \nI always design type 1 versions first (so try the pfb/afm combination).  \nMost software should handle the type 1 (PostScript) files correctly.  \nWhen I generate ttf fonts from type 1 fonts, programs such as FontForge  \nput the specially named symbols in an area outside the regular glyph area,  \nand so, renaming may be necessary for some applications, as you pointed out.  \nIn summary: try the type 1 version, and let me know.\n\n"
