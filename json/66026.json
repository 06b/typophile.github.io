They're innovative, modern, fun and young.\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/soho\\_gothic\\_pro\\_bold/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031100955/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/soho_gothic_pro_bold/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/soho\\_gothic\\_pro\\_bold/\")\n\nCan anyone suggest a sans serif font that would pair well with it when used for text? I found that for large bodies of text, Soho Gothic is not the most readable font.\n\nThanks for the help!\n\n",
