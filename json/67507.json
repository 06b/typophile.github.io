Is it just numerals or is it letters too, and if so, is it just upper case or both upper and lower case?\n\nAre ordmasculine and ordfeminine Spanish?\n\nSorry if this has been asked before. Please can you point me in right direction.\n\n",

      "content": "I'm not sure why only ordinal masculine and ordinal feminine are given (well, likely a backwards-compatibility issue), because even in Spanish it's possible to have something other than º or ª:\n\nOfficially, when used with numbers they should always go after a period (DPHD: numerales: 1). In practice, they might not, and visually I think it's best to kern them pretty much directly over the period, or even better, combine them such that the period appears more as a combining underdot.\n\nThe most common endings are -o and -a, but they can also be used in the plural, -os and -as. Additionally, primero and tercero (and all ordinals that end with them) have an apocoptic singular form -er.\n\nThey're not just used on numbers though, and are often found in abbreviations, most especially Mª for María. But I've seen hrmn^os for \"hermanos\" amongst others. (edit: unlike French, in Spanish they should become capital in all, though limitations in computer typography make this less common in day-to-day typing)\n\nMy ultimate recommendation is to make a good superscript variant and place the o and a from that into the º and ª of the regular, since that covers you for other languages that might have even more complex forms. Opentype coding to place the dot(s) is just a superficial nicety.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick: (Speaking strictly about Spanish) Underscore is seen too, but I think, without much basis in actual knowledge, that's an English influence to it. In handwriting one doesn't place a mark under it nearly as much as much as we do in English. But, for the record doing it 1.º with the º being underlined is seen in the standards as an option (explicitly contrasted with 1.º without an underline). But that just looks too busy for my taste. The dot satisfies the \"correctness\" [insert smirking mock] and the visual nicety. Now what would be really fancy is to have the long over-tilde for abbreviations that went out of fashion about 150-250 years ago on inscriptions. But OT isn't great for variable-letter diacritics.\n\n"

But not really wow as they are all based squarely on a series of mathematical transformations of the originals to achieve thickness, y-position and additional spacing on either side. Some designers also give the glyphs a bit of a stretch in the x-direction too but there are only so many hours in the day.\n\nIncidentally, my lower case superiors have a slightly bigger x-height relative to the caps superiors compared with the original upper and lower case.\n\nYou also get some very particular and thorough designers who add accented superiors so as not to disappoint, for example, continental European users.\n\n"

You have to work with all the numbers that would need kerning  \nIf your font has only caps or caps and small caps you can use the caps as ordinals.  \nWhen has upper and lowercase than your ordinals should be lowercase.  \nThe old fashion is to underscore the ordinals.  \nBut you can also eliminate the underscore.  \nI am working with a Caps/Small caps alphabet and I send you a sample of the matter.  \nRegards, Luis\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119012542im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Ordinales_4799.gif)\n\n"
