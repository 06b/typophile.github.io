  "content": "Hey all, this is my first time posting here, need some help on a logo.\n\nThe client is a photographer who focuses on music/band and fashion photography, aimed mostly at younger people. He says what sets his work apart from the rest is the way he captures colour and movement.\n\nThis is what i have tried to represent in the logo. The final roughs i think look OK, albeit rather cliched. The client has chosen the logo bottom right (despite me saying the extra swirls and colours seem a bit overcrowded, and that the swirls on the other logos ’sit together better).\n\nThe client is happy, but i can’t help but think that i could make the logo more impressive. I’m not too hot on identities and logos (this is my first paid job), so any pointers are appreciated. Thanks!\n\n [‹ logo for furniture designer](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924105632/http:/typophile.com/node/44613 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo for my company ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924105632/http:/typophile.com/node/44285 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

No name? - but that’s a photographer’s best asset.\n\nThe eye is definitely clichéd - there’s heaps more to explore - flashes, viewfinders, framing, viewing the world differently.  \nIn my opinion doesn’t really capture “movement”. There’s also the issue of being able to consistently reproduce that number of colours in a logo (you’ll be printing CMYK every time.)  \nCould you not simply use and abstract portion/crop of the photographers work next to the text, thus allowing some flexibility in the ’identity’ you print that logo under a picture in a book etc and it’ll take focus away from the image.\n\n—————  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Small Studio.

I didn’t even see an eye until reading the discussion!\n\nI strongly agree with the advice to start with b&w, and also to try a different typeface. Go for punky & distressed! Perhaps retro art of an eye rather that’s more stylized and less abstract.\n\nPlay with it! I look forward to seeing what you come up with.\n\n—-  \neeblet.com\n\n"

You also have a great opportunity to create an “eye” out of the letter “O” of the name.\n\nPlay with this logo! Have fun with it!\n\n- Manuel\n\n“Less is more”\n\n"

I agree with others regarding the typeface that it’s not “young” enough, maybe you can show movement in the typeface. I just didn’t feel it at first, but now that I’ve been staring at it for a while, I kinda like the left bottom one.\n\n"

I think refining the minimalist look or going punk would both be good directions, but that the current logo proposals seem totally inconsistent with the brand.\n\nGood luck!\n\n—-  \neeblet.com\n\n"
