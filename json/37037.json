  "content": "hi you all there\n\nmy name is johnny. i’m graduating in visual comm. / typography at the basel school of design in two weeks.\n\nI’m fully a fontlab- and FEA-novice, but i’ve drawn a font - and i need a RANDOM glyph substitution to get to work in it - that puts me in trouble at the moment.  \nif i don’t have that feature in the font, the whole thing is half as good/relevant.  \ni just opened an account in typophile to talk with experts and find the solution\n\nmy situation is quite similar to steffens in [http://typophile.com/node/17887](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327123501/http:/typophile.com/node/17887 \"http://typophile.com/node/17887\")  \njust with the need of RANDOM added to it.\n\nmy concept is simple:  \nfor each letter i drew 4 stylistic variants in fontlab 5 studio - then while typing the generated font, for example an A, it should each time just take another A out of the 4 alternatives there are.\n\ni get this to work, in the way that i can choose an alternative A in the glyph window (“alternatives for this glyph”) in InDesign\n\ni tried the feature “substitue from ” , putting all my A-variants in a glyphclass  \nit works. BUT IN INDESIGN IT ALWAYS JUST TAKES THE VARIANT THAT IS FIRST IN THE LIST OF THE CLASS.\n\nthen i found the typophile discussion linked above and tried twardochs suggestions with the salt-feature and ss-feature  \nworks in the same way but HOW DO I GET THE RANDOM INTO IT ????\n\nhope someone can help me!  \nthanks a lot\n\njohnny\n\n [‹ Web Hosting](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327123501/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37146 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help: naming conventions for ligatures based on alternate glyphs? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327123501/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37095 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

BUT IN INDESIGN IT ALWAYS JUST TAKES THE VARIANT THAT IS FIRST IN THE LIST OF THE CLASS._\n\nthis is how the the “sub from” syntax works.  \nthere is no way to get “real” randomness in OpenType (unless you somehow build your own plugin for the application, that does what you desire) but you can acheive some level of pseudo randomness.\n\nthere are several threads here on typophile discussing how to achieve this effect, i’ll let you wade through them yourself:  \n [http://www.google.com/search?q=random+site%3Atypophile.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327123501/http:/www.google.com/search?q=random+site%3Atypophile.com \"http://www.google.com/search?q=random+site%3Atypophile.com\")\n\nif you want someone to implement this for you, you might contact [tal leming](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327123501/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/tal%252Bleming)\n\n"
