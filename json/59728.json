  "content": "Dear Typophile Associates,\n\nI would like your comments on the attached PowderHouse Logo.\n\nPowderHouse will be mostly web based; products for women (beauty and accessories). I researched Fournier and Fontanges and was influenced by Fournier, the powdered wig era...I found a comment \"The hairdos are as high as a house\". So I combined soft and hard, old and modern.\n\nThank you for your comments.\n\nBest regards,  \nJudy\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [PowderHouse Logo rev.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106090953/http:/typophile.com/files/PowderHouse%20Logo%20rev.jpg) | 62.44 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Who are your client's customers? It seems to me that women who buy beauty products want to look youthful, so I'd advise you to stay away from anything that says _old_, such as typographic allusions to the 18th Century.\n\nIf this is a mostly web-based business, it won't cost any more to use color, and this type of product calls out for a logo with soft, warm colors.\n\nWhy did they pick the name PowderHouse? Were they thinking of the \"powder houses\" where armies used to store gunpowder? If so, maybe they have more of a punk aesthetic in mind, an _explosion_ of color. It's a question I'd ask if it were my client.\n\n"
