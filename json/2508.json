I've heard that older monitors actually blur the pixel fonts that employ this technique.   \n   \nI ask this because the letters do not run into each other. I'm not sure how literally you meant that. Can you send me a screen shot of how the graphic shows up on your screen?   \n   \nNow that I think about it, since this is a graphic and not the actualy pixel fonts, the letterforms should stay in tact.   \n   \nCan you give me a bit more to go on here? I'm afraid your input has come across as more of a put-down than anything I can use to make the font better.   \n   \nDo the grays make each letter look blurry, and because they are placed one pixel apart from one another, they give an overally appearance of running together?   \n   \nAlso, how does the non-aliased version of Rolos strike you? Do its letters run together as well?   \n   \nPerhaps it's the design as a whole that you dislike?   \n   \nAny greater detail on your feedback would be great.\n\n"

I see it as a thick black line with notches in it before I see it as letters. It's so squat and so bold that there's not much room for the bits that differentiate the letters from each other. The majority of them look like little squares with holes in them. There's hardly any word spacing either which doesn't help.   \n   \nThe aliased and antialiased versions look basically the same to me. The only one I really notice it on is the Deluxe set in flash, it's a little fuzzy but still suffers from the same problems as the others.   \n   \nIn contrast, the font you used to title each section is quite readable.\n\n"

I've added an extra pixel to the space keystroke, and it brings out the words far better than before.   \n   \nHaving spent so much time on so many different faces for the launch of MT, I'm afraid I lose perspective on things.   \n   \nI know that Rolos is a squat, specialty face, and that's all it's intended to be. More than anything, it is one example of my desire to push the boundaries of each letterform to their limits in ways that other pixel font designers haven't explored already.   \n   \nDespite the fact that this font is only four pixels high, it's intended to be used as a ( very small ) titling font, for burst useage.   \n   \nThe other font is Nerve, a narrow face also intended for titling.

      "content": "Christian, take a stroll through these forums and you'll find both pixel fonts and outline fonts that are alarmingly simimilar in some or even all of their characters. I won't even bother to include links to these unless you persist in your assertion that every font reviewed on this site is original in every way.   \n   \nIronically, I say this in regards to the Revelare site, as I didn't even know about the message boards here until some time after my font Ram ( which is the one I assume you're referring to ) was built.   \n   \nMany of my fonts are as much as two years old, which is when I began building them for my now defunct web magazine Champfactory. Mean Tangerine was supposed to launch almost exactly one year ago.   \n   \nIt was then that I changed the site design from the first one I'd built ( have you looked at that one? ) to the one you don't approve of now, and it has taken way, way too long to build, and cost too much to change now.   \n   \nWhat you're failing to take into account is that many of the same letterforms can be reached by any number of pixel font designers entirely independantly simply by the limitations of the traditional pixel grid size.   \n   \nWhen I did see that post, I was bummed that someone else had produced a similar font. However, many of my characters are entirely different, and are smoother as a set. Am I going to delete my work because someone else has created something similar?   \n   \nOf course not. Take a look around before you make despairing accusations.   \n   \nAs for the Revelare site, I have in fact used their zooming metaphor. As i've described in a previous post, that metaphor is so elegantly simple and effective, I can't think of a way to change it without breaking it.   \n   \nThe navigation metaphor is all I've used. It just so happens that squares look like squares no matter what kind of background you put them against. At any rate, my button assisted navigation is unique, my layout ( entire site structure ) is completely different, and my presentation of content is also different.   \n   \nTake a closer look at Revelare. You'll see they sell their whole site as a site navigation solution. I mention this because it is highly indicative of what the revelare site really is, as recognized by its creators.   \n   \nA superiour navigation system. Is it graphical? Yes. Is it beautiful to look at? I think so. They are actually marketing it the same way Flash Loaded is marketing their Ultimate Scroller. A method of presenting and navigating large amounts of information.   \n   \nI'm curious to know what you think of all these sites ripping each other off with menu bars, animated masks, and scrolling lists?   \n   \nPerhaps next time you could comment on the font I've posted, thereby fulfilling the purpose of this particular message board?\n\n"

I'll definately look further into your suggestion for the q.   \n   \nChristian, thank you for your reply. Having a litte more text to read this time around gives me a much better idea of your overall message.   \n   \nI realize that there are going to be many who disagree with me on many issues. All I can say is that the fonts I've used on TYC come from months of hard work and experimentation, as is evident from the body of work there, from the photography to the journalism. I have a love of storytelling, and the typefaces are just one element in that.   \n   \nAs my argument regarding Revelare, which part is bogus? Revelare IS selling its zooming metaphore as a navigation/content delivery solution. It's not bogus, it's real. It's also a valid interpretation of that to say that they recognize the beauty of that system as a navigation system rather than a singular instance of a page/site design.   \n   \nIt may not be the only interpretation, granted, but it surely is not a bogus one.   \n   \nAs for navigation systems being proprietary, can you tell me a few that are? I've never seen one. The Apple/Windows thing being one easy example.   \n   \nAs for the overall reaction of plagarism: oh well. As I said before, I've delayed the release of my fonts to some amount of peril ( as illustrated by your questioning my font Ram ) for the sake of going forward with a superior navigation system that not only has never been used as a commerce store, but doubles a pixel metaphor, while also zooming further and further into the world of the small, reinforcing the theme of pixel fonts.   \n   \nI made my choice a year ago to put the site experience first and my \"I wanna be a star designer/creative\" second. That meant going with a system that reinforced the pixel font motif and was easy to use.   \n   \nThe pixel fonts I'm trying to market are the creatives, here. The site design is solely intended to show them in their best possible light. I believe this design does that. I've used the best possible design elements to present my product.   \n   \nI think those principles apply to every commercial designer.   \n   \nEven though this board isn't about my site design, I'll post a few graphics displaying MT as it is now. It's as unique as I could make it considering my budget constraints and time constraints.   \n   \nThe site recolors itself randomly ( from a predetermined list of color sets ) every visit, which explains the different graphics.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134142im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23158.gif)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134142im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23159.gif)\n\n"

They work great in the authoring environment, but not where it counts.   \n   \nMy main objective is finishing the store application. You bring up a good idea about a depth gage. MT actually already employs a bit of this idea, and is one of the departures from Revelare's.   \n   \nAs you drill down, the site lessens in opacity until at great depths, the color approaches white. This is a subtle but effective psychological indication of depth. In fact, looking at the graphics, you'll notice that the squares with the greatest color saturation are the font specimen squares. This is where the greatest depths are reached. You see the relationship there.   \n   \nAs for implementing better thought-out features and overall posishing of the site, I definately have plans on the board to do just that. But for now, budgets demand I release the site with the assets I have right now.   \n   \nCan I email you personally to discuss your \"grey\" pixel font technology?   \n   \nTanya, your observations are spot on in my opinion. However, to my chagrin, I've tried that letter b in about 37 different encarnations. It didn't look right to me with the bottom missing because then it looked too much like an A or R.

They haven't replied.   \n   \nI makes me think that they're only interested in enterprise clients, but that's only my take on their unresponsiveness.   \n   \nThose sites that you've linked to are beautiful. I wouldn't say that they use the metaphor in question though. You say they use a similar metaphor. That's a true statement. To say they use this metaphor with similar and therefore original designs is not a true statement.   \n   \nThey give up too much of the overall beauty of Revelare's metaphor. They're simply linear zooms. No grid. They give no idea as to how much content is on the site at a glance, nor where that info is in relation the everything else. They do not operate on a grid, and do not give the overall impression of different sized pixels, which is the whole pixel font reinforcement thing.   \n   \nI like the idea of matte colors because they assist in the overall navigation feedback. This could be where I'm stumbling big-time. I've always taken the simplistic color treatment to be an integral part of Revelare's navigation metaphor. This due to the section ques they offer.   \n   \nI could achieve the same thing I suppose by sticking more titles up there in each square, or putting icons in there, but that wouldn't be 1/10 as intuitive.   \n   \nThat's my whole take on the Revelare metaphor. Intuitiveness.   \n   \nAs for the size of the squares, not to worry. I'll be changing many things over time, as I can generate revenues to continue development on the site.   \n   \nAs it stands now, I'm pretty locked in to what's been developed thus far. Sure, I could change the squares to rectangles, I change the color of the font to black, and I could use a pixel font that is too wide to fit in the size of each square given the possibility that future titles will be longer than others, but all of that strikes me as a pretty weak stab at making it all unique.   \n   \nI didn't change the color of the type because white looks the best. I didn't change the size of the squares because I don't have enough content yet to build the site on a smaller grid. As for the font treatment, it's my own pixel font.   \n   \nAlso, when you posted your graphic of Revelare, why didn't you take a shot of their entire site, showing how they present their content? As methodical you have been in presenting your proof that I'm a rip off artist, you have misrepresented your evidence.   \n   \nSo far, at least under the name jh, you've posted five times. All five have been to me, and none of those posts have been to offer critisism to my type, or anyone else's. I welcome your critical eye, but so far, despite the fact that you've seen at least five original fonts of mine ( between the TYC site and the fonts on this board ), you've only seen fit to call me bad because you've seen a link to a font that's similar to one of mine.   \n   \nHow about some of that critical eye going to the font I have up for review?\n\n"
