      "content": "I haven’t contributed because I cannot totally grasp the usefulness of this list.\n\nWhat I mean: there’s no need to argue about the essentiality of Georgia & Verdana for on-screen (i.e. web) usage –&nbsp;due to the medium’s limited options. If your profession is book design, then you better have a good Garalde or two. Which face? Up to you, imho. And for corporate design projects or magazines, you want to have a big versatile system – not that important (or better say: easy to agree on) which very one, &c\n\nThat said, I rather like the approach raised in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202055209/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29208) (the answers by Dan, Paul and others).\n\n"

      "content": "I think fonts are too subjective for a list like this. The only essential is that the font work for the project I have in mind. And have a thorough character set.\n\nTypophiles will never agree on anything. What one typophile calls essential might be a font I wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot-pole. And vice versa.\n\n"
