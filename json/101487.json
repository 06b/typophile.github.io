I am wondering, what effect does PS hinting have on printing? Does it make the final product sharper on digital print I am looking at printing at 1200dpi - 2400 dpi on both commercial and non-commercial printing services. There is mixed discussion related to Type1 fonts but nothing on OTF. Also, I have tried using Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType to make autohints for my font - on Mac OSX (Mountain Lion) the glyphs look fine on-screen, bit haphazard on PC (Win7).\n\nAny comments/suggestions are welcome.\n\n",

      "content": "I'm sorry you don't understand, David. Let me explain. :)\n\nStroke density refers to the intensity of blackness (presuming nominally black text) independent of stroke thickness. In good quality print and in b/w pixel rendering, stroke density is consistent, i.e. it doesn't matter whether one is looking at a thick stem or a hairline stoke, the density of the black is the same. And since one of the few things we know absolutely about reading is that strong contrast between figure and ground is important, it follows that stroke density is important to reading. If strokes are greying out, then contrast is being lost, and hence reading conditions are suboptimal.\n\nFrom your comments here and elsewhere, you appear to be judging how good fonts 'look' on different platforms relative to how closely they match the colour (heaviness of texture) of print, which is a reasonable criterion if one of the things you are trying to achieve is a kind of parity between print and web editions of a publication. It's a criterion that is independent of and may be at odds with criteria related to readability on screen, given that comparative text colour doesn't imply anything about stroke density of bits and pieces of individual glyphs.\n\nI say Microsoft are more concerned about stroke density than Apple because they have deliberately made their ClearType rendering model retain intensity where Apple allows theirs to grey out. This is simply an observation: in Apple rendering horizontal bars regularly grey out, while in Microsoft rendering they remain good and dark.\n\nNow, with regard to stroke density vs hinting, these are not necessarily directly related, since it would be possible to manage stroke density at the rendering level without hinting if one had a sufficiently good means of analysing glyph shape. For example, Apple have demonstrated that they are able to get pretty good stroke density at key alignment zones (baseline, x-height and cap height), but they fail when horizontals do not fall at these alignments, and after many years they show no sign of caring to solve this problem. [Note that I am not even bothering to get into the effect of Apple rendering on a variety of non-Latin scripts that involve many horizontal strokes at non-standard heights. The claim that 'All fonts look better on the Mac' doesn't stand up to non-Latin scrutiny.] While stroke density needn't rely on hinting, Microsoft decided that they would make use of hinting information to help them retain stroke density, and this is demonstrated by what happens in DWrite's y-direction antialiasing if one compares fonts with hinting and fonts without.\n\nFinally, here is the Brill PS font rendered with DWrite in Internet Explorer at the same size as in your comparison above. I agree that the comparative-to-print colour of the Mac rendering is overall closer -- although terribly inconsistent at the level of individual glyphs --, but I don't think that is an important criterion when it comes to reading on screen. The DWrite rendering is sharper and the letter shapes more clearly defined (less fuzz) -- note this also reflects my personal CT tuning preference, which is for sharper glyphs rather than heavier ones --; while lighter than the Mac rendering and hence less close to the print image it is more internally consistent in weight, and crucially, in my opinion, it is more consistent in stroke density (see enlargement).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809090640im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DWriteMac_5029.png)\n\nIf you have a nice long corridor leading away from your screen, try walking backwards and note how long the enlargement on the left continues to look like an _e_ and the point at which the one on the right starts to look like a _c_.\n\nThere are a few aspects of the DWrite rendering that I would expect to be different and better if the font were TrueType, notably the height of the middle horizontal of the uppercase B.\n\n"

And if you use the term stroke density to mean dropout control, you’re messing with terms in use for decades.\n\nAnd at some point...

The 1000 unit limitation was specific to Type 1 fonts. At least one third party PDF-creator assumes a 1000 UPM for all PS fonts, causing spacing problems if this is not the case, but other than that and a problem with cursor scaling in the first version of InDesign, long since fixed, I've not encountered any problem with a non-1000 UPM in CFF fonts. Indeed, we've even made 2048 unit CFF fonts for Adobe.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI don't think I am saying that horizontal bars are the be-all-and-end-all and that everything else can go to hell. I merely point out that this is a consistent problem in Apple text rendering at what you've spent years reminding me are still important resolutions. I also pointed out what I think are other problems with the Apple rendering as shown in your example: greatly inconsistent weights across different glyphs and an overall lack of sharpness.\n\nNor am I saying that I think the Microsoft rendering is perfect. In terms of PS rendering, though, its a heck of a lot better than what Adobe's black box produced for GDI. And it has _some_ qualities, despite its lightness, that I think are better -- i.e. better for reading -- than what Apple produce for the same font at the same size and resolution. Do I wish it were possible to marry those qualities to a better representation of the true weight of a given type? Yes. Do I think achieving that better representation is worth throwing out those qualities? No. That's where you and I seem to differ in opinion, and it is at that point a matter of opinion.\n\nI use a terminology that might be different from what you use because I've thought about it carefully and determined that we should be able to talk about stroke density as a quality of text independent of particular technology. Drop-out control is a particular technical mechanism that plays a role in stroke density in particular environments. I originally settled on the term stroke density because various people -- including Kevin Larson and other cognitive psychology folk -- were talking about 'stroke contrast', which is a confusable term since typographers use the same phrase to talk about the relationship of thick and thin strokes in a letter (what I call stroke modulation pattern when I'm seeking to be precise, which is most of the time).\n\n"
