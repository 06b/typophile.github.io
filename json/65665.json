I used it for school papers, which was probably fine until I started pairing it with something like Blur for titles and subheads. Nobody could read it, but I tried very hard to ignore those comments because I just thought it looked so very cool. :-)\n\n"

      "content": "Hm... Well, I like to I think I had relatively good taste in type even when I was in high school. The earliest typefaces I remember liking back then were Windsor, Avant Garde, and Bookman, all in rub-down type. I remember thinking the ITC faces I saw in the Chartpak catalog were the best-looking. I had an aversion to what we call \"retro\" now--brush scripts and the like. I used Korinna for my first personal letterhead when I was in college in about 1975. I think my wardrobe was more cringe-worthy than my type choices back then--polyester shirts, bell-bottoms, and aviator frames. Bleah.\n\n"

      "content": "I feel sincerely sorry for my middle school yearbook cover design. I had combined a playful brushy font with Copperplate, the latter set in a rainbow of colours, which was cringe-worthy enough. But the yearbook advisor was attached to the idea of using Aboriginal paintings—the kind with colourful mosaic-like arrays of dots—for the background, which left the cover an undistinguishable splash of various colours and rendered the whole thing unreadable. Even my young self knew that the type and cover didn't go together, although I dared not speak up about it.\n\n"
