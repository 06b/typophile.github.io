The two LSU graphic design students working with me were great, it was more like an old fashioned sewing bee than anything else.\n\nThe process was very interesting,; after a full academic year of intense thought, research and teaching, it was very rewarding to be making something again. The tiny stacks of finished pieces were a delight to see. But fun, well, not exactly fun.\n\nThe booklets are beautiful and ship, on time, tomorrow. I will post the final shots (below).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706103119im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/05_3456.15.08.4.typo.jpg)\n\n"
