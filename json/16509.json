I have about 70,000 fonts in my database and Font Navigator takes 8 seconds to start. Extensis Suitcase took 5 minutes (!) to start with that database on the same machine.\n\nBut when Linotype releases FontExplorer X for Windows, I’ll migrate.\n\nAdam\n\n"

I tried 9.2, but went back to 9.0 as it allows for temporary activation. The only downside to Suitcase (for me, at least) is no auto-activation, which Linotype’s FEX is supposed to address, although I’ve heard that auto-activation is more or less impossible in the Windows environment. We’ll see.\n\n"
