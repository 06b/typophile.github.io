What would the best encoding be for this format? I know that many of the characters must be able to stack on top of each other in order to make sounds, would it be best to make all of these combined characters into ligatures and create an extensive liga set in opentype? This project is just beginning and I think I’ll have a lot of time to both draw characters as well as figure out the technicalities. I’ll probably have a million more questions as I start to get into this, so any help is appreciated.\n\nOK  \nRC\n\n [‹ Glyph ID and the cmap table](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016080247/http:/typophile.com/node/37742 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Free Family Naming Software? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016080247/http:/typophile.com/node/37769 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
