      "content": "Hand lettering in the style of the era. Note the variations in repeating letters.  \nThe beaked terminals on \\_T\\_ and \\_S\\_ are distinctive, but are found in some fonts of the 1900s. Also with \\_E\\_ similar to the title. For example check the fonts at Greater Albion Typefounders [http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater\\_Albion\\_Typefounders/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140527155623/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater_Albion_Typefounders/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater\\_Albion\\_Typefounders/\") and you might find something you like. Note the similarities with Bonning, Bonaventure and Vertrina.  \nOther similars include Canada Type's Ronaldson [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140527155623/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/\") and Intellecta's Benjamin Franklin [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/benjamin-franklin/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140527155623/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/benjamin-franklin/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/benjamin-franklin/\")  \nDon\n\n"
