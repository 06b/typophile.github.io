TJ's is interesting because most of their product labeling uses very recognizable fonts, and not their logo type, except to represent their brand name.\n\nI was surprised to see that apparently no one has asked this question here before, according to a Google search of this site.\n\nBTW, I also looked at Jason Walcott's Jukebox fonts at Veer. His Tiki family might have had some close ones, but actually they were less similar than Patty's suggestion.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The lettering of YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERY STORE is House [Tiki Magic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318013519/http:/www.traderjoes.com/about_tjs.html).
