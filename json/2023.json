Notice the number 1 used as a capital i.   \n   \nThanks for your help!\n\n",

      "content": "There is a very good chance you will never find this font, because such fonts can be made by anyone. The way the baseline bounces all over suggests this one was made by someone who was either new to this skill, or wanted to create a font that looks unskilled. I looked through the booklet of 300 handwritten fonts that came with the ClickArt CD about 8 years ago, since these fonts have a way of popping up all over, but this was not one of them. However, I think any number of them could be used as substitutes, and they can all be found on the web under various names. Step 1: Look at the fonts in [Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051341/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html) for something that has a similar feel, or quality that you like about this one. Step 2: if the name has an 'HW' in it, look that font up in the [HW Font Alias List](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051341/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/HWFontAliases.html) . (This list tells the names these ClickArt fonts were renamed to by WSi so that they could sell them as their own fonts). Finally, Step 3: When you find out the Alias name, you can download the renamed font [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051341/http:/iquebec.ifrance.com/jeannine/6fontpolice.htm). As far as the '1' for 'I' switch, all you need to do is type the 1 instead of the I, with any of these fonts.\n\n"
