  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm wondering if someone can help me identify the two fonts in the Modern Family logo. Really I just love the way the sans and serif fonts seem to go together so well, so if anyone has any other suggestions for unpretentious, readable, sleek pairings like this, I'd take those as well. I just like this effect very much!\n\nThank you all in advance, this forum has been a lifesaver for a type-illiterate person like myself.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223140004im_/http:/typophile.com/files/brand_6083.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "I think Jan has probably answered the font question. As for other pairings, I think the goal would be to (probably) find similar weights, but dissimilar styles. So this means, for example, don't use a mix from a superfamily that has both serif and sans versions of the same font.\n\nMaybe experiment with varying the weights too, now that I think of it. Might be more interesting than keeping the same weights. Anyway, I think it's been done many times, but it can be fun mixing unexpected combinations.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Is the x height vs cap height similar enough? Similarities in width proportions. All of these does not have to match, but they must harmonize somehow.\n\n"
