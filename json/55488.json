Sorry for being vague, but I've signed a NDA.\n\nVAG rounded for marketing collateral.\n\n...Now thinking of cutting Vag Rounded to make the logo.\n\nBy the way, thanks Nick for the Softmachine suggestion. I really like it! And all the other typefaces you have created. Great work.\n\nFor this situation Softmachine is too playful.\n\nI need suggestions for other, more serious, and more corporate typefaces that would work with Vag Rounded.\n\nAnd I need suggestions for a Mac - PC default typeface to work with Vag Rounded. Perhaps this default typeface could be that more corporate typeface..\n\nMuch thanks for your assistance thus far.\n\nLook forward to hearing what you guys think.\n\n"
