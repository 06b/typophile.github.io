  "content": "Hi,  \nI'm looking for a nice sans-serif to combine with Plantin (roman and italic, running text, 11/13). Can anyone explain to me what i should keep in mind when i try to combine sans and serif? Is it just a feeling or are there some general rules? i can imagine X-height and colour hasve to be more or less equal, or is this not necessary? Should there be a contrast instead?\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n",
