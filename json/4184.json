  "content": "Hey Guys!   \n   \nI am working on a identity and packaging project for one of my design studios and this is my idea so far. A luxury men's cosmetic company, salon level products. I imagine men in their late 20's to their 50's, probably businessmen, live in the city, maybe single.   \nThis is the first time I have ever hand lettered anything like this from sketch to screen. I am going to post the basic black and white form first...it needs help. still in the baby stages.   \n ![initial](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121645im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32932.gif)   \n   \nhere is the same with a variety of colors and in reverse.   \n ![colors](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121645im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32933.gif)   \n   \nand now a SEPERATE and yet related issue: the tagline type   \n ![tagline](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121645im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32934.gif)   \n   \ncritique em!\n\n",

      "content": "I think your sketch has lots of energy and the basic form is nicely balanced, particularly with the tagline below.   \n   \nMy concern is that it look very _drawn on a computer_. Not a bad thing, just seeing some tortured beziers. I'd suggest taking the basic form that you have (which is nice) and work it out on paper using a veriety of different writing instruments. Try pencil, try charcoal. try a thin and flexible watercolor brush. try fingerpainting, try a stick, use paint, use pastel, use ink. Draw it 100 times in less than an hour. Bang Bang Bang.   \n   \nThen when you digitize it, it will have some vibrancy, but with consistency (which I think is lacking now since you drew it with a digital tool, not a physical one). You don't have to be great with your hands to do expressive handcrafted work. Side note: The gi connection is distracting.   \n   \nGood luck!   \nRandy\n\n"

I think it is a short strong word, that could be memorable in a good way.   \n   \nI thought maybe a gold foil for the logo on some crisp white stock might be nice for a label. Still working on that end...   \n   \nAs I did my research it seems that most men's labels are very much like the example from Andrew Baker's above post...very minimalist. I tend to work in that style, and it seems so obvious. So I was trying to get away from that...but maybe the best solution is a simple straightforward type solution like the gild in mrs. eaves. I have another week to go so I am going to continue to explore the mark and also materials for the labeling and packaging.   \n   \nthanks a lot people   \n   \nsx.\n\n"

To be honest though, the assignment is for shampoo, conditioner, and soap. So, I was being a little broad with my cosmetics bit early on. Although I don't think there would ever be a real brand that only did shampoo conditioner and bar soap... ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121645im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nOther name choices I have pondered: Modello, robusto, modostile, luxe, modo, bloke, oakwood, churchill...thats most of them.   \n   \nSo, I believe I will hold gild in reserve and back to the drawing board.

Shapes are clumsy and too playful, GI glyph is too abstract, varied line widths are too extreme, negative space is distractive. Looks like a cross between Cyrillic and Arabic, possibly illegible to someone who does not know what it is suppose to spell out.   \nMy suggestion- go back to original design which works.
