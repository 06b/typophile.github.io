This is a publication so I have to think about it being consistent with last issue also. Should i make only the d lowercase? make everything but the d uppercase?\n\nthoughts?\n\nthanks!\n\n",

Reduce the size of lower case \"d\", then increase its weight by applying a \"Stroke\" value.  \n2. Use a \"d\" from a smaller optical size, if your typeface has one.  \n3. Choose a \"d\" from a related font that has the appropriate weight at the size.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023214938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/JaneSmith_5630.jpg)\n\n"
