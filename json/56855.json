      "content": "Hmm. Here's how I would do it: Most graphics programs have a setting for the \"paste offset\", which is where the content of the clipboard will be dropped relative to where it was picked up. If your layout software has this, set it to move left a distance that equals the width of the image or text you want on the edges (stretching it wider than it will actually appear may help with the math and to straighten telltale curves) divided by the number of right-hand pages in the book. On the first page, place your image or text almost all the way off the page, the left edge of it just barely on the right edge of the page. Copy it. Turn the page. Paste. While it's still selected, copy it again. Turn the page. Paste. Copy. Repeat until you're done. Then go through again and crop each instance to a guideline so only that strip on the edge of the page shows up. I can't think of a way to make it more automated than that. You could set up keystroke macros if you're into that sort of thing, but it's probably easier to just do it.\n\n"
