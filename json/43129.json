  "content": "What methods do you use in matching different fonts to make sure they work well together?\n\nFor example, I am designing a website for a medical consulting firm. They already have a logo using Kuenstler 480 Bold. So I am looking for another font to use for the headings and pictures of the site. I want the font to be friendly and professional fitting a medical website. I also would like it go work well with the logo which is very prominent. How do you approach this? Thank you.\n\n",

Match the historic period, or at least look for influences between.\n\n3.) Similarity of letter shapes, particularly common letters like the <cite>a</cite> and <cite>e</cite>, can create a sense of harmony.\n\n4.) Consider first the options designed by the same person.\n\n"

      "content": "Design texts make people way too paranoid about font matching. As long as the proportions aren’t noticeably different for type being used on the same line, what really matters is that the fonts look good together. Using fonts that clash can be a fabulous way to build a hierarchy. I just did an organizational press kit that Pill Gothic for text and a mix of Pill Gothic Condensed and New Baskerville italics for headlines. The distinctiveness gets pretty wild in places, and it’s all kinds of fun to work with.\n\n"

      "content": "Tomtype, I recommend sitting down for an hour or two at a time and mixing and matching faces. You'll learn what works and what doesn't, and out of that, you'll find matches that you can and will depend on for the rest of your career. Sure, you'll keep finding new ones, but you'll find the combinations that work particularly well, and they'll be part of your stable.\n\nI'd start with one typeface, like you have for this client, and just work with some that seem to go with it. Practice with the two of them to learn how the subtleties work together, then refine your choices based on what works best. You'll probably find two or three that work well with your \"control\" face.\n\nAnd, of course, when you see a good combo used elsewhere, find out what the faces are.\n\nTo me, it's a lot of fun, but my wife doesn't like it so much as a theme for a date.\n\n"

As I'm new perhaps someone could point me in the right direction if it isn't.\n\nI have to produce a Greek report where the required font is Frutiger LT 45 Light. I understand there was a Frutiger LT Greek a few years ago. Does anyone know where I can purchase this?\n\nIf not, can anyone recommend a Greek font that looks very similar and where I may purchase that? Many thanks.\n\n"
