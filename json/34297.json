  "content": "Hello Typophile amigos, I recently completed a basic Dreamweaver website in honor of Jan Tschichold. And in my quest for knowledge I found the ever so awesome Japanese magazine IDEA did a whole issue on Jan Tschichold it was actually, IDEA NO. 321 : Works of Jan Tschichold. If I wanted to order this from Japan I’m looking at $67. Does anyone know where I can pick up this issue in the states? I live in Las Vegas so my outlets here are pretty nill.

But you can see the site @: [http://checkofoto.com/tschi\\_sites/tschicholdindex.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080515214758/http:/checkofoto.com/tschi_sites/tschicholdindex.html \"http://checkofoto.com/tschi\\_sites/tschicholdindex.html\") . Most of my class had no idea whom Señor Tschichold was so this was more or less a primer to hopefully gain interest not only in Tschichold but also in typography. I also did a Flash site in honor of Paul Renner. that one should be up before typecon. Comments are cool. Ciao, √0\n\n"
