And you're right about the G not resembling the Akzidenz G so it can't be that.\n\nNaoiseo: I'm sorry I havent got a higher res scan.\n\nI thougt this was a pretty common typeface but I really can't figure out what it is or even find other examples of it in use now that I look for it.\n\nI thought I'd seen it on old jazz vinyl record covers, mid century style, but I might be wrong.\n\n"

      "content": "First of all, Opti made no original fonts. All were clones of others. The name Giant came from the original Filmotype typeface of that name. Filmotype had a whole slew of these Gothics with names that started with 'G' - from the thinnest, most condensed Galaxy Gothic to the heaviest, widest Goddess Gothic.\n\nSince getting any Opti font these days can be tricky, I'll mention that the old [Brendel](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012031008/http:/www.qbf.de/dceng.htm) equivalent, [Undertaker](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012031008/http:/www.qbf.de/cart/cart.exe?gif=dc.gif/Sdc02638.gif), is available.\n\nTo my eye, though, what was used is one size down the ladder at Garfield Gothic. This is available digitally today from URW as Bee 3. The [Bee fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012031008/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bee/) take their names from the VGC equivalents of the Filmotype faces. VGC creatively named those B-1, B-2, etc. The only problem with the URW fonts is that they don't include any of the alternates, like that straight-legged 'R' that were available in the Filmotype originals.\n\n"
