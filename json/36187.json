Released as a [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115053521/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) in 2005.\n\n**Notes from FSI**\n\nFF Maiola was born as part of Veronika Burian’s MA in Typeface Design at the [University of Reading](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115053521/http:/typophile.com/wiki/University%20of%20Reading). Although a contemporary typeface, it retains strong links to historical models by implementing old-style features and calligraphic forms. Sources of inspiration include Czech type designers [Oldrich Menhart](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115053521/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Oldrich%20Menhart) and [Vojtech Preissig](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115053521/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Vojtech%20Preissig), whose works display both vigor and elegance. Still, the intention was not to follow their path, but to define a personal interpretation. Maiola bears its idiosyncrasies with care and imparts the concepts of irregularity and angularity in a beautifully discrete way.\n\n[OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115053521/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) technology adeptly combines typographic features such as small caps, lining and old-style figures, both tabular and proportional, ligatures, alternate characters, case-sensitive variants, and fractions. In addition to the regular Latin character set, Maiola Pro includes Central European, Cyrillic and Monotonic Greek characters.\n\nIn 2004 FF Maiola received the “Certificate of Excellence in Type Design” award from the Type Director’s Club ( [TDC](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115053521/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TDC)).\n\n**External Links**  \n [FF Maiola at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115053521/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Maiola)  \n [Release Announcement](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115053521/http:/www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/jul2005/)\n\n",
