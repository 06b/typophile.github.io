  "content": "Hi there! I am a graphic design and advertising student working on a corporate identity project.\n\nI am currently working on a littering campaign assignment for a state government. The rational behind the campaign is that litter starts small, and as it accumulates becomes a big problem, therefore, one should stop littering as to not start a mass mess.  \nP/s: Brochure will be a door fold and is still under construction, as such part of it still needs more text. Contributions on your view on littering is greatly appreciated as with the design/typographic side of it.\n\nAlso, the criteria for the assignments include application of the campaign onto a minimum of 8 different medias, therefore, any media suggestions would be great too. :)\n\nAs of now, i plan to do:  \nPrint Adverts  \nBillboards  \nAdvertorial  \nBrochure  \nDustbin (?)  \nPlastic Bag (Not really turning out too well for me. =/)  \nAmbiance (ideas needed.)  \nStickers (to be stuck on random stuff that could be litter/ or to remind people to not litter that item) (?)\n\nThanks in advance guys! =)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [samples 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823032301/http:/typophile.com/files/samples%201.png) | 105.91 KB |\n| [samples2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823032301/http:/typophile.com/files/samples2.png) | 89.39 KB |\n| [samples3.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823032301/http:/typophile.com/files/samples3.png) | 399.5 KB |\n\n",
