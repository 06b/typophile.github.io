  "content": "Hi, I am looking for the name of the typeface which you can see on the bus in the moive \"Into the wild\" -  \n\"FAIRBANKS CITY TRANSIT SYSTEM\"\n\nI tried the usual websites (MyFonts, Identfont) - but I am not happy with the results:\n\nSolpera, Signature, LT Brewery - Details are wrong. (And it's hard to see.) I am very interested in your input. Thank you - sorry if this is a FAQ that didn't show up in my search.\n\nExample of the movie poster (found with google-image search):  \n [http://everettruess.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/into\\_the\\_wild\\_movie\\_poster.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120718221425/http:/everettruess.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/into_the_wild_movie_poster.jpg)\n\n",
