For instance, I noticed that the Atlantic Monthly uses full caps for three letters or fewer; small caps for four letters or more.\n\nDoes the use of italics change anything? (Yes, I unfortunately need to set something in caps \\*and\\* italics. Even in small caps it looks a bit funky, but a lot less funky than in full caps.)\n\nWhich, I reckon, is the final rule: which looks better?\n\nBut, lacking a style rule (or at least I couldn't find anything relevant in the Chicago Manual of Style), I thought I'd solicit opinions here.\n\nThanks in advance.  \n\\_\\_\n\nDavid\n\n",

Some faces have small caps of varying height. Some people will set a three letter acronym in SC. What face are you using and what is the range of possible usage in the publication?\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/node/12543](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014214427/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12543 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/12543\")\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the link to that thread. I did do a search before I posted, for what it's worth, although I admit I was a wee bit impatient sorting through it.\n\nAnyway, face is LTC Deepdene. It's actually in the acknowledgments page of a poetry book, so it's small-ish (9 pt.) and there aren't all caps/small caps occurrences anywhere else in the book.\n\nThat said, on the same page is a three-letter all-cap, and for that I'm keeping full caps. For the longer word (seven character) I'm 99% sold on small caps, with 10/1000-em tracking (which is probably conservatively tight, but it works--a reminder here that the text is set in italics, as that's proportionately relevant).\n\nGranted, too, it is, in effect, \"fine print,\" but thought it was as good a time as any to solicit opinions.  \n\\_\\_\n\nDavid\n\n"
