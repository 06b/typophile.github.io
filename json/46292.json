  "content": "Hi. I'm looking for a font that I can use for a Buddhist Program in Taiwan. It will be used on a web site in body and headline sizes. I want something that is historically founded, but doesn't feel like an old dusty textbook. I'm looking for something contemporary but I don't want it to look like a trendy asian fusion restaurant or a spa.\n\nI was thinking Scala or Whitney. Because they feel intelligent, precise, cultured and modern (?).  \nI would also like to find a typeface with a caligraphic influence but an terrified of it looking like an 'east meets west' cliche.\n\nI appreciate your help. thank you.\n\n",
