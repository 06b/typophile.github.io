You rule.   \nNow that you can actually see the face, I should probably explain my idea.   \n   \nI looked to some of Herbert Beyers early faces in addition to many other modular, grid fonts and geometric sans faces for inspiration. I wanted to mesh the formulaic and reconstructing attributes of modular design with a touch of humanistic qualities to give a bit of spontaneity to the forms. Thus, a kind of subtle man vs. machine characteristic.   \nI limited myself to vertical and horizontal segments & one radius for the construction.\n\n"

I am working on making alternate characters to be included in the face to play along with the title of the face-Stereotype-. The characters are simular in thier construction, but by using shift or option you could get alternates to kind of destroy the stereotype of preconcieved ideas of what the next typed character will look like.\n\n"

Actually, the O bothers me a lot. Nothing wrong with a plain old circle, or even just a circle that doesn't close at the top. Rotate the zero 45 degrees so you have a diagonal bar, and you've got a nice joke on dot-matrix zeroes.   \n   \nThe \"ED\" ligature is very, very interesting. Something very Shakespeare-gone-modern about that.\n\n"
