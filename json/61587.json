I never met either Tschichold or Wilson (I never met McLean either, but I spoke with him on the phone), but they had an enormous influence on my design aesthetic. And, through Adrian Wilson's book, I was also strongly influenced by Jack Stauffacher, although I didn't really know where the influence came from until I met Jack some years later. All of these typographers were concerned with readable text, and with effective design that aided the reader, not the ego of the designer. (Jack Stauffacher still is, I'm happy to say.) Trendy books are useless. Actually, they're more than useless: they're often pernicious. Though as Ben McElroy (_bemerx25_) points out, even those can serve as the spur to get us interested.\n\n"
