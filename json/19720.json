Is it another font all along? (Or would it maybe just be a “customly edited” Flux?...)\n\nThanks already, once more, for your help and patience.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222005033im_/http:/typophile.com/files/totobola_3499.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Mercedes Monster headline - Corporate A {Stephen}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222005033/http:/typophile.com/node/19630 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) La Casa del Consumatore - Adobe Serif MM substitution font {Geoff} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222005033/http:/typophile.com/node/19718 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
