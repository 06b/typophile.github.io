I was wrong.\n\nThe closest I got on this is [Sackers Gothic Heavy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150114222533/http:/www.fonts.com/font/monotype/sackers-gothic). The apostrophe and quotes don't match at all but the basic lettering is pretty close. Of course, we're looking for something much bolder, here.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150114222533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sackers_6400.png)\n\n"
