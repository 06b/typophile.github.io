It reminds me of the face used for Australia's tourism branding. I don't even know what search terms to use to find something like it.\n\nDoes anyone know what it is? Or one similar?\n\n(In case the image doesn't display, you can see it here: [http://www.typophile.com/files/prueba%202\\_5770.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20130328072401/http:/www.typophile.com/files/prueba%202_5770.gif))\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [coolfont.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130328072401/http:/typophile.com/files/coolfont.jpg) | 3.36 KB |\n\n",
