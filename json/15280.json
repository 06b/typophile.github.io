  "content": "I have spent a lot of times reading the other threads in this forum, and I must say that I am slightly ashamed of posting a logo of such inferior quality... but you have to start somewhere.\n\nI am creating a logo for our company, b10 solutions inc. The company will provide consulting services in bioinformatics (computer science applied to biology). I wanted the logo to be simple and to show a mix of both fields, so I constructed the word \"bio\" (biology) out of 0's and 1's (computers). It's not really original, but I find it better than using a double helix to represent biology (examples of double helixes on top of my head: [IDT](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.idtdna.com/images/home/home_pic_logo.gif), [Genome Canada](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.genomecanada.ca/GCimages/navigation/logo.jpg), [Sanbi](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.sanbi.ac.za/GenomeAfrica/Sanbi_logo1.gif), [Stratagene](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.stratagene.com/templates/images/logo1.gif), [Beckman](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.beckmancoulter.com/images/home_img/top_banner_logo.gif), [Invitrogen](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.invitrogen.com/imgLibrary/home_ivgn_logo.gif), [VWR](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.vwrsp.com/globalimages/vwr_intl_logo.gif) and [Bio Can](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.biocan.com/images/nav/BioTop_1.jpg)).\n\nAs you will probably notice instantly when looking at the attached logo, I have no formation whatsoever in graphic design (only an interest). We unfortunately cannot afford to pay for a graphic designer at this time. We definitedly will one day.\n\nOf course, I will be really thankful of any comment or critique I get concerning the logo, but I am particularly interested to find out about basic or technical errors I made. Things that anyone with some education in graphic design will spot right away.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [b10\\_sur\\_fond\\_blanc.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/typophile.com/files/b10_sur_fond_blanc.gif) | 6.06 KB |\n| [b10\\_sur\\_fond\\_noir.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/typophile.com/files/b10_sur_fond_noir.gif) | 5.48 KB |\n| [ChrisG\\_b10\\_idea.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/typophile.com/files/ChrisG_b10_idea.gif) | 3.42 KB |\n| [ChrisG\\_b10\\_idea\\_mod.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/typophile.com/files/ChrisG_b10_idea_mod.gif) | 3.26 KB |\n\n",

I also feel in general if the mark can't be read in black and white its not strong enough. Stick with a simple type treatment that can easily be read and do your marketing with either a tag line or accompaning copy.\n\n"

      "content": "Bird,  \nWhen you pronounce the name of the company do you call it \"bee ten\" or \"bee one zero\", or should it be bilingual? Should it include \"solutions inc\" in the title, in which case it would be a mistake to leave that out when considering the logo design. The suggestion Jan made of separating by using colour would result in the b being treated as a separate element in the pronunciation, you could also use a zero with a diagonal crossbar to make it clear that it is a numeral, and by extension the character next to it is also (because it has the same height and colour). The b needs some attention try making the ascender lead into the counter like [Pump](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=pump), not necessarily with the open counter, just the junction of the two elements at the base and keeping the echo of the 1 in the curve at the top. A point about printing orange, like purple it is difficult to get it to print satisfactorily using 4 colour process.\n\nChrisG,  \nAt the moment, since the redesign, it is not possible to upload images unless you are the creator of a thread, when you can add them to the initial post. You might also want to read this [thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023042707/http:/typophile.com/node/14424).\n\nTim\n\n"

      "content": "tim, in english we pronounce it it \"bee-one-zero solutions\" and informally \"bee-one-o solutions\". In french \"bé-un-zéro solutions\". In written form it is important to leave it as \"b10 solutions\" because this way it is the same in both french and english (our market contains both french and english speakers).\n\nI agree I made a mistake by leaving out \"solutions\" from the logo\n\nI will try out what you propose concerning the b tomorrow\n\nAbout orange... I didn't know about this, why is that? (my guess is you see yellow with dark magenta dots instead of pure orange, am I right?)\n\nAgain, thanks all for your comments, they are greatly appreciated.\n\n"

      "content": "Bird,  \nMy question related to how you space the characters, to see if it was possible to infer the pronounciation from their appearance. A customer, seeing your company name might presume bee-ten, it might be worth your while practising with the spacing to see if you can produce the correct pronounciation.  \nThe problems with reproducing orange are due to the limited colours that yellow and magenta can produce, generally they reproduce as a brown. Your printer should be able to tell you what he would prefer, but I would go for something like 100% yellow and 50-60% magenta. The effects will also be influenced by the type of stock you are printing on.  \nTim\n\n"

I find the modified one more consistent, but I still don't know which I prefer it.\n\nThe modified design uses 100% yellow / 50% magenta according to photoshop's CMYK model. On my home monitor, it produces a satisfactory color. How much will that change on real paper with real ink, I don't know.\n\nI have tried to play with the spacing, and I agree with what Chris G said to me by email: \"I think this does not necessarily make the matter any clearer\".\n\nChris G asked if it would be possible to use \"B 1 ZERO\" to communicate the pronunciation of the name (\"zero\" is \"zéro\" in french, but \"one\" is \"un\"). Technically, yes, but I dislike the inconsistency it would bring (why have \"1\" written as \"1\" and \"0\" as \"ZERO\"?).\n\n"

      "content": "That junction of stem and bowl on the b makes a dark spot in your new design. The same x-height removes the b-one-zero reading and returns it to bio. The binary look you were trying to employ overwhelms the logo in your new designs.  \nThe strapline is not positioned well under the logotype, it appears to overhang to the right (because of the curve of the 0); it is also a bit light for use in all applications, a business card for example, the tracking/kerning is too loose, especially apparent in the INC, you should be aiming for even optical spaces when kerning, a method for checking kerning is to print it out and view it upsidedown with half closed eyes, the light areas should appear similar in size.  \nAs a final point it is more useful to create your logos in a vector drawing program (like Adobe Illustrator or Freehand) because that will allow you to enlarge the logo without worrying about resolution and the file size will be smaller, it will also be easier to create 4 colour, spot colour and rgb versions. If you continue with Photoshop, for most print uses you will need to have the logo at least at 300dpi at the size you intend to use it.  \nTim\n\n"
