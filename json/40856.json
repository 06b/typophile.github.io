I’m not the greatest at remember the font names yet or the little characteristics that set them apart from other fonts so I’m in search of a book to help me out. I know that I’ve seen books like this before but I’ve searched chapters already and came up empty handed.\n\nThanks  \nChris\n\n [‹ Name of Letterpress Museum in San Francisco near the Marina?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906220102/http:/typophile.com/node/40906 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tell us about the Support Typophile link at right--\\> ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906220102/http:/typophile.com/node/39992 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The “see also” cross-references are particularly helpful for identification. If you know the name of a font that looks similar, you may find what you seek in the cross-reference. I use it daily.\n\n"

Almost all the faces in it are available digitally, so it still has a lot of currency.\n\n"

I ended up finding an old adobe book of fonts at my current workplace “Derksen Printers, Steinbach” which helped me out for the moment, but FontBook will still be needed.\n\nThanks again,  \nChris\n\n"
