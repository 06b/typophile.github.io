Got to do an assignment to design a double page spread.\n\nLooks like Times new roman or similar for body text but the footer doesn't look right? The number 9 don't drop below the baseline in the same way. when I use that font.\n\nAnyone got any suggestions?  \nThanks\n\n",

I also had noted that they used Galliard for some titles, and DIN and Univers for some headlines and captions.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
