I'm in a middle of a project and just can't load the font to my Mac Pro 10.5.1 desktop system. I actually had the client put the fonts on a CD for me, since e-mailing or ftp didn't work. Looks like it's a PostScript Type 1 outline font. I tried to load it with Lynotype font Explorer and also Suitcase, but it didn't work. I'm out of my wits and can't proceed working on my project until I have this issue resolved. Any ideas? I included a screenshot of the one of the font icons.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 7.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100924174808/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%207_6.png) | 20.42 KB |\n\n",
