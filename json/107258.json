  "content": "I was looking through the 1934 Standard Line catalogue, when I learned some interesting facts about Caslon 471.\n\n- Instead of being set on the Art Line, like Cloister Lightface, it was set on the Original Line. That may mean that it is not part of the American Line system, and isn't an even amount of half points away in baseline from Standard Line, Art Line, and whatever ATF's Title Line was called.\n\n- It is supposed to be _identical_ to Caslon 540, except for the latter having shorter descenders. This, I presume, excludes some pantographic width adjustments to make the widths even multiples of 1/4 point given the letters now being larger to fit the slug with the lower baseline.\n\n",
