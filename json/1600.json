I think it's good, it just needs something, and I don't have any idea what that something is.

Those letters are   \na tad bit dark.   \n   \nthe f in 'for' seems a little tall, too.   \n   \nbj\n\n"

However it strikes me that you are overpowering the copy.\n\n"

So a jackass for jesus would be someone who doesn't have it all together, yet God chooses to use them anyway...   \n   \n   \ni actually didn't change the 'f' to look like a cross, just wanted it to line up with the bottom of the j's.   \n   \ntim, i'm curious what exactly you mean about rotating the question mark to make it look better. I guess i don't really see it.   \n   \ni'm going to see if i can thin out the j's and i'll post my changes hopefully later on tonite. Thanks for the input!\n\n"

You have something clever going with the question marks, but throwing it inside an actual picture of a donkey is just way too literal and ruins 'aha!-ness' of it.\n\n"

      "content": "Scott, Jews read the Tanach, or Torah Shebiksav, which is _not_ limited to the five books of Moses: the latter is a common misconception among gentiles. The term Torah by itself refers to the five books, but the Torah Shebiksav also contains the Nevi'im (Prophets) and Kesuvim (Writings). Altogether they form the Palestine Canon of 24 books; note that this is a different canon from that which was read in Christ's time: in Christ's time Jews read the Septuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Torah Shebiksav. _After_ Christ's time, the Jews returned to the Hebrew text, but decided to leave out those books which had traditionally been part of the canon of scripture but for which they were unable to locate _complete_ Hebrew manuscripts. These seven books are retained in Catholic and Orthodox Bibles, but were removed by the Protestants in what you would refer to as 'content management', and are referred to by Protestants as the Apocryphal books. Catholics call them the Deuterocanonical books.   \n   \nJews, Catholics and Orthodox Christians all maintain a strong tradition of _non sola scriptura_; that is, unlike Protestants, they do not rely solely on scripture as a source of truth, but also on tradition and teaching authority. In Judaism, this tradition is traced to Moses and is called the Torah Sheb\n\n"
