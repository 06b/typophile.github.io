Her only request is that I use the typeface\"Marzo\" for headers.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/marzo/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417042411/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/marzo/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/marzo/\")\n\nI'm not in love with this face, but I'm trying very hard to make it work. I find myself struggling with finding a suitable font that pairs well with this . Any suggestions?\n\n",
