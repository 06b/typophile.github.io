Does anyone know where I could find a   \nfont like what's used on Bicycle playing cards?

I contacted Mr White over the weekend because his Web pages were not accessible. He wrote back that the server was renamed as per below. I can't reach this new URL either and he's aware of the problem and contacting the Duke sysadmin.   \n [http://bibliofile.duhs.duke.edu/gww/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310071635/http:/bibliofile.duhs.duke.edu/gww/)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310071635im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/7387.gif)   \n   \nCampanile and Ringlet (Normal, which is thinner that Black) are reportedly included in \"24 Victorian Display Fonts\" by Dan X. Solo. Amazon has it. I was going to include a link, but those Amazon URLs are so long it'd wrap 2 or 3 times.   \n   \n.\n\n"
