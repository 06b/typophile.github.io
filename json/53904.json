This special day was established to promote the fine art of handwriting. [Monotype Imaging](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/typophile.com/wiki/www.monotypeimaging.com%20) has provided Typophile with examples of [Handwriting Day Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/msg1svc.net/colov/155227/62/25130/5798/0/H/jegf.html) that add a personal, handwritten quality to a variety of projects. The [Handwriting Value Pack](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/msg1svc.net/colov/155227/62/25130/5798/0/H/jegf.html) found on [Fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/typophile.com/wiki/www.fonts.com%20) provides five great fonts that deliver the look and feel of handwriting designs.\n\nHandwriting has inspired some great formal script typeface designs including several [Inaugural Invitation Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/msg1svc.net/colov/155227/53/25130/5807/0/H/jegf.html). For example, the [invitations](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/nyregion/thecity/21prin.html) to the January 20th presidential inauguration, which while hand engraved on copperplate, were based on modified versions of two Linotype typefaces: The [Shelley™ Allegro](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/msg1svc.net/colov/155227/55/25130/5809/0/H/jegf.html) and the [Kuenstler™](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/msg1svc.net/colov/155227/51/25130/5805/0/H/jegf.html) fonts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Inauguration%202_5434.jpg)\n\nDesigned by [Matthew Carter](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/TypeDesignerShowcase/MatthewCarter/) for Linotype in 1972, the [Shelley™ Allegro](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/msg1svc.net/colov/155227/55/25130/5809/0/H/jegf.html) font is a formal script design that can bring elegance not only to invitations, diplomas, or greeting cards, but it also works equally as well in display applications such as packaging or advertising. Based on the traditional English copperplate scripts, the [Kuenstler™](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184218/http:/typophile.com/wiki/%5B%5Bhttp%3A/%252Fmsg1svc.net/colov/155227/51/25130/5805/0/H/jegf.html%20) font is another formal script and features a small x-height and fine hairlines.\n\n",
