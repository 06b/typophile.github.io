Similar to traditional imagesetters, it works with laser and films and outputs 2400 dpi, but with a modern technique.

      "content": "Hi Hrant,  \nYou can buy a classic Approval for under a grand, but it is a little smaller than the 1984 380Sl my wife has. Approval prints run the gamut, but I think Tabloid should run $35.00 if you are not in a rush. They are pretty available, not everyone uses them for contract proofing and Inkjets are quickly biting away because of the cost per print. I've seen legal size (5 pt) type printing black on a yellow and it was indistinguishable from film output. I have had Latran/Polar proofs made and they were great too, with 7pt serif (Bemtus from URW) knockout type being sharp as a razor.  \nFor line art an old lino(or Agfa or Monoype, or screen or scitex, or  \nRipit/Exxtra etc) work wonders even at Level 1 postscript. You get a level 3 RIP just to be able to iron out any minor issues and Level 3 is where most output devices are so you can have predictible results You don't have to calibrate if you are going for line work and a desktop imagesetter (Ripit/Exxtra) are no larger (and lighter) than a tabloid laser printer. A roll of film has about 100' feet and can be had at around $80.00-$120.00.  \nI had great experiences with L330s, Screens (very expensive even used), and Ripit/Exxtras. What I liked best about the Ripits is Adobe based RIP and ingenious flexible Drum,very accurate and light.\n\nActually the problem that Goren describes is more of a Toner and SPI than any acutal laser issue, it is doing its best, but given the resolution and that the dots have to be made with Toner make it heavier. Have you ever noticed that type gets lighter and lighter when you go from Laserprinter to the actual printed piece? This is even more noticlble with inkjets on offset/copier paper too.\n\nThe Truth shall set you free\n\n"

Looking at it with my 35x loupe, I can see that the black is not extremely black however: it has faint whitish spots spread about. What's most interesting though is the lack of aliasing - instead the outlines are a bit coarse, basically what photo paper does I guess. Ironically, I suspect this might actually make the naked-eye result even better, at least in terms of fidelity to the -eventual- offset output, but possibly even in terms of readability (where I happen to believe there's such a thing as too crisp). On the other hand there's still much to be said for seeing what you've made as crisply as possible - especially when it comes to judging a font's color.\n\nAs for the paper stock used, it has a slight off-white aspect, but also has a nice gentle matte feel, and most of all it's luxuriously thick: I measured it at 9 mils\\* which is almost as thick as a typical business card.
