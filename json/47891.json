If it is upright then set the tag in italics. If it is, say, condensed the go with a wider style. Etc. ad infinitum. Look for contrast... Once you have defined the parameters of what you are looking for try Veer or MyFonts-all the usual suspects.\n\nOr you could set it in the same face, just much smaller.  \nMichael\n\n"
