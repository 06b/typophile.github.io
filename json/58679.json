Inspired by designs in “how-to” commercial lettering guides of the 1940s, it has been refined and brought into the 21st century through a huge variety of ornate swash letterforms. The lowercase “h” alone offers 43 variants. Hundreds of ornamental ascenders and descenders allow a beautiful interplay of strokes and combinations, while avoiding overlaps or conflicts. Adios Script features a mind-boggling 1,470 characters in total, in [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103123021/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) format.\n\n**[Adios Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103123021/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000431)** received a Certificate of Excellence at the Type Directors Club and was selected at the Tipos Latinos biennial.\n\n**[Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103123021/http:/www.sudtipos.com/)**\n\n",
