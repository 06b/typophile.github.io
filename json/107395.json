I have been unable to identify it from any current digital type foundry, so perhaps it was never digitized.\n\n[http://webidiot.net/pics/moogscript.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422055018/http:/webidiot.net/pics/moogscript.png)\n\nIt has stylistic cognates in Murray Hill, and some of the script fonts from the Filmotype library, but no exact match. Can anyone with any older type specimen books from the phototype days help me out?\n\n",

      "content": "Hi osamu,\n\nI know what you mean about the style re: Murray Hill - it also put me in mind of Nevison Casual, Brody Script and Saginaw - they all have a similar vibe  \nAlthough, I note that you say you need to find an \"exact match\" for the example, well that could be difficult. I've been through a lot of my reference material and didn't find anything there (not yet anyhow). But, if close is OK - and you do mention the Filmotype library - then check out \"Honey Script\". That may work.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/honey/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422055018/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/honey/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/honey/\")\n\nJust an idea\n\nRegards  \nDoghouse\n\n"
