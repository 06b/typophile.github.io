I checked this against the Georgia font on my operating system, and here the ’ydiresis’ glyph has a glyph ID ’185’.\n\nAs long as the cmap table is correctly defined, would this function properly on older apps/os, or do glyph ID’s have to conform to an encoding (and then this has to be specified in the cmap table)?\n\n [‹ A replacement of my old ATM after Vista upgrade?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827132050/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37850 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Free Family Naming Software? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827132050/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37769 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
