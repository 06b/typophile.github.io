The face itself needs something else to modernize it for 2002 and distance it from 1997.

As much as I love the similar typefaces that came out in the mid-late 90's, I agree it is slightly dated.This was a good insight and much appreciated. I will need to re-think the design as a whole if I work it into a full type face.\n\n"
