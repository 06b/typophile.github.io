      "content": "I would say this is a very popular style of serif font, related to Scotch Roman, which was designed around this same time. It has had many imitators, which continue even today. Font Bureau and Hoefler are just two modern foundries with recent adaptations of this serif style. You could use the [Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202042242/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php) with information about some of the other upper case letters (M, J, K, E, U, R and W, in particular), if you want to try to narrow down the fonts that may be close digital representations of this style.There are quite a lot to choose from. Just using these lower case letters, I had 189 families to compare. With the upper case key letters I mentioned you should be able to narrow that somewhat. Then you can checkmark ones that are closest, and compare them against each other.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
