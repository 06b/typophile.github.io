I know that he mentioned at one time who the designer was that made it but I cannot find the text again...\n\nAnyway, I love the font, any help with what it is and where to find it?\n\nCheers.\n\nJoshua\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TRY!.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090521095809/http:/typophile.com/files/TRY!.jpg) | 49.6 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Joshua, a display version of a font is meant to be used at large sizes, say huge on an album cover, so certain design details are tweaked.\n\nThe specific example in this font is the ink trap in the capital Y in “TRY”. If you look at the sample posted by Norbert you’ll see an extra notch in the “valley” of the Y, which is very obvious at huge sizes, but it helps to sharply define the “valley” at small sizes.\n\nThe Bell Centennial typeface was designed by Matthew Carter for Bell telephone books, and the ink traps help the clarity of the letters under the stresses of high-speed printing and their legibility at tiny sizes.  \n [http://www.linotype.com/13687/bellcentennialboldlisting-font.html?PHPSES...](http://web.archive.org/web/20090521095809/http:/www.linotype.com/13687/bellcentennialboldlisting-font.html?PHPSESSID=d0565fba35fbaa2e61d211fa902a0dc0 \"http://www.linotype.com/13687/bellcentennialboldlisting-font.html?PHPSESSID=d0565fba35fbaa2e61d211fa902a0dc0\")\n\nSome typefaces use the ink trap as a design device. A brilliant example of this is Christian Schwartz’s “Amplitude”.  \n [http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude](http://web.archive.org/web/20090521095809/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude \"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude\")\n\n"
