  "content": "I have several typefaces from the 1800's that I'm trying to identify, and I haven't yet been able to find anything that's close enough. I found them on a storefront dating from the 1800's. Both photos are quite old, but I'm not able to precisely date them or date when the signs were actually created.\n\nIn the first image, I'm looking for the type used to write \"patisserie\" and \"confiserie.\" Underneath the sign, \"Henri Auer\" is written in a different typeface that I haven't been able to ID yet either.\n\nThe second photo shows the storefront quite some years later. In this photo, \"Henri Auer\" has been inserted in the original sign, in a different typeface.\n\nAbove the storefront, another sign mentioning \"Patisserie\" and \"chocolaterie\" has been added, with yet another typeface.\n\nI'd really appreciate any help you all could give me in identifying these typefaces or finding existing fonts that are a close match.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [img023.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141118184612/http:/typophile.com/files/img023.jpg) | 117.06 KB |\n| [img022.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141118184612/http:/typophile.com/files/img022.jpg) | 115.45 KB |\n\n",

They do have a lot of things in that style though.\n\nI've thought about re-drawing the letters, but the problem is that I need to write \"Maison Auer,\" and so that would imply creating certain letters that aren't on the sign...\n\n"

Other Western or Tuscan styles might come close too.\n\nFor the PATISSERIE in the newer sign, [ITC Newtext](http://web.archive.org/web/20141118184612/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-newtext/) is fairly close, oddly enough.\n\nFontMesa and Solotype both have a fair number of fonts from this era. These were just the first things that came to mind.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
