  "content": "Hello type people!\n\nI am working on a design for a client running an online business selling GPS navigation units for Audi & Volkswagen. There a few issues me and my client are having:\n\n1. Can't decide which of these logotypes are appropriate for the market. His competitors are doing a terrible job establishing an aesthetic, so we have to make a new one. The trouble is in what fits a business dealing with medium-high range luxury vehicles (said from an average income perspective of course:)\n\n2. Can't decide on layout decisions, my client is having a great deal of trouble choosing, so am I since my clients are usually very opinionated.\n\nThanks guys,\n\nTypophile's interface makes you want to really join the community! (y)\n\n\\<3 to all type lovers.\n\noh and i understand that most of the work you see here is not design for print.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [vagnav\\_update2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417183517/http:/typophile.com/files/vagnav_update2.jpg) | 401.07 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I agree with eliason. I like the top right logo. But I assume \"vag\" is supposed to stand for Volkswagen Auto Group. In all lowercase, it looks less than V-A-G than it does a word that's slang for, well, a word that starts with \"vag.\" I wonder if you could create a logo in the spirit of that one, but in all caps (at least for the VAG part of it).\n\n"
