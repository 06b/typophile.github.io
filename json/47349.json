I followed Enzo's development closely on Typophile (then known as [Zai](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101091609/http:/typophile.com/node/32881)) and I'm pleased to see it released as a FontFont. We'll be sending the newsletter announcing the release in a few weeks.\n\nWe're still fixing some snags in the Advanced Character Set viewer which will reveal all your lovely ligatures and such on each font page. It will be up and running soon.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101091609im_/http:/typophile.com/files/InDesignScreenSnapz002_5055.gif)\n\n"
