  "content": "Updating the look of a Wedding magazine. After using a combination of Sloop and Garamond for years, I thought it was time for a change. Settled on P22 Zaner for the script for titles and headlines, great ligatures and extended character sets, this is what drew me to Sloop.\n\nI had hoped to find just the right Sans Serif font to complement Zaner. Trying to find a family with the strong character and versatility of Neutra. Neutra is being used quite a bit by another publisher in the same region, so that is out.\n\nIn some other threads, there is mention of Seria and a few others, but none have really clicked.\n\n",

Knowing the history of work by Edward Johnston and Eric Gill, applying humanistic proportions and shapes to the geometric sanserif, defines why I like Neutra and what I am looking for. I agree, it is close to Neutra but this helped a lot.\n\nAlso from the Font Bureau, I like one of their new faces…Antenna\n\nPriori Sans and Parisine are also very nice.\n\nthanks again\n\n"

I think I would suggest something a bit grotesque like [National](http://web.archive.org/web/20101213195135/http:/vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/). or if you really are set on something similar to Neutra, I might like [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20101213195135/http:/www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html). I'd almost be tempted to try [Omnes](http://web.archive.org/web/20101213195135/http:/joshuadarden.com/shop/omnes.php), but that may be pushing it a bit too much for a magazine?\n\nPlease keep me in the loop with this project. As the designer of Zaner, I'd much like to see the final product. Thanks!\n\n"

I hate to make the case against Relay, since it's a great magazine sans.\n\nIncidentally, <cite>The Knot</cite> uses Jeremy Tankard's Bliss, which is another Gill-ish sans.\n\nIf you haven't already, you might take a look at Verlag (from H&FJ: [www.typography.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20101213195135/http:/www.typography.com/ \"www.typography.com\").) A similar character to Neutraface, it might be a sympathetic companion to Zaner because of the relatively small x-height and long extenders.\n\n-- Kent.\n\n"

Knowing its designer is watching—the pressure is on!\n\nKent, thanks for the heads up on Relay and Bliss. Relay seems to have a great range and personality. Wondering if there is room to work with Relay, without copying or appearing ignorant of its use in the industry.\n\nEven though Neutraface is a large family, many layouts I see seem to gravitate to 3 or 4 faces. Suddenly it seems to be everywhere. Rightfully so, it is also a great font. Just curious, was it the use in House and Garden that has pushed it to the tipping point?\n\n"

      "content": "If you're keen on using Relay, by all means don't let me discourage you. I think there are plenty of overlaps in the wedding magazines market. <cite>Brides</cite> uses Relay with a mix of other faces. If you use a different mix, Relay could feel quite different.\n\nI would suggest you pick up a copy and take a close look at what weights and styles they're using. My recollection is that they tend to favor the Condensed styles for headlines. You could try leveraging a different aspect of the family and thereby get a different look.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
