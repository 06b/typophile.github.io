Even before looking at it I used to say that a good type design book should have:a.basic rvisual rules and (most importantly) 26 Different chapters, ONE for each letter (or52) with all the individual characteristics and that exactly what this book is about. For some weird reason there seems to be no bibliography devoted to the actual proffesional design of fonts.. I would recomend Cheng's book to anyone.\n\n",

It may well be a good book on letterform construction, and valuable in that regard, but letterform construction is not type design and analysis of letterform construction is not analysis of type design _processes._ Obviously these are criticisms of what the book claims to be and is advertised to be, rather than criticisms of what it actually is. As Peter says, the book is useful in providing a comparison of approaches to letterform construction. But to claim this is focusing on type design processes is a bit like saying a book on structural engineering focuses on architectural design processes.\n\n"

Calligraphy is handwriting pursued for its own sake, dedicated to the quality of the shapes. From evaluating and discussing our experiences a theory of writing emerged that allowed us to describe the properties of shapes with parametric precision, without imposing aesthetic or ideological conditions.This book is an introduction to the theory.\"\n\nAnd in an unpublished text provisionally called \" The decadence of all design:\" \"While looking for an alternative [to indoctrination] I avoided the subject of design. Instead I concentrated on the interaction of tool and shape that could be expressed in parameters of the stroke. And here, at a convenient distance from design, I found the Archimedean point that enabled me to describe design with a high degree of precision.\"\n\nNo book will say all there is to say about designing type, but I do think Noordzij's book deserves the status of 'recommended reading.'

It is only because I know Noordzij has taught at The Hague and I have seen his type design work and the work of his students that I would think to relate his ideas to type design. If I encountered _The Stroke_ without knowing anything about Noordzij's involvement in type, and considered only the content of the book, I would presume that its principal audience was palaeographers and its principal critique was of common methods of palaeographic analysis, which seek to categorise letter shapes without understanding the tools and techniques involved in making them.

Applying the content to type design requires interpretation and extrapolation, because the subject of type design is not directly addressed in the text.\n\nHrant: _The proof is the fonts..._\n\nThesis?

This derives from notes I made many years ago when I was researching different approaches to spacing (including Kindersley's). I was planning a two-part essay for the defunct _Serif_ magazine entitled 'On the just spacing of letters'. The title was a reference to Durer's 'On the just shaping of letters', and it struck me that what the renaissance treatises on letterform construction and modern writing on the spacing of letters had in common was that both ignore the question of scale.

Especially  \nfor somebody who sees problems in the two major schools,  \nConstructivism and Chirography. Strangely enough I think my  \nstrategy has been to simply scare them a bit. :-) To say that  \nthe \"good way\" of making letterforms is a thorny issue, and  \nthey'll have to think about it on their own a lot. Mechanically,  \nI've advised them to think principally about notan, about the  \n\\*boundary\\* of black/white, as opposed to merely building the  \nblack and allowing the white to fall into place. Beyond that I  \ntry to explain the necessary balance between cohesiveness  \nand individuality among letterforms, I show different ways in  \nwhich certain elements (like numerals) have been done and  \nwhat the pros/cons are, all while asking them to doubt doubt  \ndoubt, to take no precedent for granted, and certainly not try  \nto make fonts the way I do! I have no idea if this'll work though...  \n\"\n\nStrangely enough, I think my students appreciated this style.  \nBut I'll know more when I read the class evaluations...\n\n\\> I think it would be fruitful to put size at  \n\\> the centre of a type design curriculum.\n\nI agree, and really, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but by GN's  \nown admission, the dimension of scale is missing from his celebrated cube.\n\nhhp\n\n"

My paper will be based on my MA Reading dissertation, \"Practicing theory: a study of Gerrit Noordzij, teacher\" and I was hoping to be able to discuss it with you in advance.\n\nMuch obliged.  \n\\_  \nDavid Cabianca, Toronto\n\n"

I'm not very interested in introductory classes in anything.\n\n"

      "content": "Learning the numbers in the measurements is not of so much value. The act of taking the measurements and conjuring theories for differences as you take them, leads to thought beyond what the caliper tells you. This is the value that goes beyond the time spent doing it. I would also recomend that students fight with drawing glyph curves--building them up by going back and forth using black and white paint and brush--before ever drawing glyphs with bezier curves on a computer. Once you complete the struggle and learn to see what makes a curve work with paint, you will later make leaps in seeing curves on the computer as you draw them. Sure, you can more quickly draw a glyph on the computer at first but taking the slower route at first speeds learning later.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
