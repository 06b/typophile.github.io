  "content": "I'm wondering if anyone has information on this typeface. A few months back I found a specimen book for the United States Government Printing Office and under the Fotosetter faces for the Smithsonian is Monotone Gothic.   \nCertainly a nice face, maybe a mix between extended versions of Akzi Grotesk, News Goth etc.   \nA month or so later I was flipping through GQ at the store and noticed what appears to be the same face. A custom job? Maybe.   \nDoes this ring a bell with anyone?   \n   \nBest,   \nEric\n\n",

      "content": "Eric,   \n   \nIt is nice. FontShop's FontBook calls it a Berthold   \nBQ face, designed by Benton in 1908. I don't see   \nit available at www.bertholdtypes.com. One could   \nassume that FontShop offers it at www.fontshop.com.\\*   \n   \nFor those who want to see what Monotone looks like   \nit could be best described as a face between Trade   \nGothic and Trade Gothic Extended. Sort of a Trade   \nGothic Semi-Wide.   \n   \n( [http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4454.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803100223/http:/www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4454.html))   \n   \n   \n\\*But I refuse to check. They've redesigned the site   \nand added all the fonts they sell, but it's in complete   \ndisarray. Hopefully it's still under development,   \nbecause at this rate it's lightyears behind www.fontfont.de   \nwhich is fast, clear, and lacks silly frames.   \n   \nStephen\n\n"
