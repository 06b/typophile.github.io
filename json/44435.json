The music was composed by Rossini in 1816, but the dance was composed by Violette Verdy, a living (French) ballet dancer and teacher of dance. It was performed last month by the Indiana University Ballet Theater here in Bloomington, IN.\n\nI have zero budget for this project, so I’m going to be limited to free faces, or those that I already have (standard Windows stuff, plus the stuff which came with Adobe Suite CS2).\n\nI’m leaning in the direction of Garamond Premier for titles, but I’m not sure it would be readable on a standard-definition TV screen for credits.\n\nI’d appreciate any thoughts any one is willing to share!\n\nThanks,  \n— John.\n\n [‹ Gutenberg documentary on BBC tv tonight](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905130907/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44217 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [so called 'Customized Typefaces' ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905130907/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44425 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
