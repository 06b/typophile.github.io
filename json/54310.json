Please correct me if it isn't.\n\nThe typography and typeface used really have me struggling to read this book. These sharp serifs alternately pinch me in the eye, or seem to disappear into the paper; the type seems distracting, and it feels too light. But maybe that's just me.\n\nI'd appreciate to hear your opinions on what you think about Meridien for books – immersive reading, novel type stuff. (And if it \"isn't just me\", I'd appreciate some good reasoning why the above might not be optimal; I might need (OK, want) to steer a client into a different direction.)\n\nCheers!\n\n",

There is still something off about the rhythm of it.\n\nAs to the x-height, I also think it is too big for a book face, but for other uses, such as tightly packed narrow columns, it might work.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this with Rocky, which is also a very spikey face, but works beautifully, in my eyes.

Would that be Bad, and better to pick a different font instead?\n\nJames, the sample I posted is an inch and three quarters wide. [Here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131213090846/http:/altaira.de/posted/meridien_pfarrer.gif) is a shot of an entire page (no margins, sorry); the whole column is just short of 4 inches wide.  \nI agree about the tracking; I may be hallucinating, but to me it also seems to vary too much (this being justified text with possibly weird settings). Actually, in some places, the letterspacing looks a bit wonky to me too (like that \"llbl\" sequence in \"Hüllblättern\" – the second \"l\" looks a hair too close to the \"b\" to me, and that's actually a delimiter between two distinct parts of a compound, so if anything, it should be looser rather than tighter IMHO).\n\n"

In most combinations, this difference is necessary to get good fitting.

In my opinion, it should never be used for text settings (certainly not books). Maybe it can improve poor spacing to become mediocre. I've never seen it produce decent spacing overall; and I've never seen it improve spacing to the point where it is acceptable for book text.\n\nBut maybe that's because I would never consider trying to use something for the sort of work I do that was poorly spaced to begin with.\n\n<cite> &gt; Optical spacing is just another tool that can be used well or poorly.</cite>\n\nMostly poorly. It's a reckless tool. No controls. Which is why I generally advise against it. If you don't have the discernment to evaluate the results, don't use it. (If you do have the discernment, then what are you doing working with a poorly spaced font in the first place.)\n\nSorry, is my cranky side showing? ;-)\n\n<cite> &gt; Wouldn’t that make the whole thing much tighter?</cite>\n\nIn my explorations, it doesn't necessarily tighten text settings. Display, yes. But not text size. Mostly it just shifts space around. Seems like it puts in as many positive kerns as it does negative ones. (Like straight-straights on the order of 1535 units).\n\n-- K.\n\n"
