The partial derivative symbol is a fairly common technical symbol and should be expected to crop up often inline in general textbooks, for example, which would not normally be set in a specialist maths font and could benefit from using symbols that harmonize well with the main text.\n\nMichel, thanks for that contribution. I didn't know about the different styles of the partial symbol being encoded as separate characters in Unicode or the upright symbols being preferred in French mathematical typesetting. I will retract my earlier claim that a partial symbol _needs to be italic._\n\nI should point out that this does not mean necessarily that one should put an upright partial symbol in one's roman and an italic in one's italic in the same slot. No one is going to use upright and italic partial symbols in the same text. Rather, if you're designing all those variants, you should treat them as separate characters and use the assigned Unicode slots.\n\nAs for Michel's question about what should be filling the blank in that picture, I think that U2202 is the natural answer if we think of \"roman regular\" as being the default character. The form of U2202 itself may be italic and identical to U1D715, or upright according to stylistic preference. The other characters are there as stylistic variants, which tells me Unicode thinks of the upright form as the default, but it does not matter in the least if we choose italic as the default form and not provide an upright form at all, because no one is ever going to need the full stylistic palette of partial symbols for the same text.\n\n"

I don't know that I would prefer an upright version for that use, but I see how one might want to distinguish between different uses of the symbol. Another consideration may be that the symbol generally appears right next to italic letters (e.g. ∂_S_) and having an upright look recalls the similar use of upright letters as operators (e.g. bd_S_). But then as you mentioned with the French tradition, I guess different typographic traditions may have different preferences for upright and italic generally for mathematical typesetting.\n\nJames, thank you for mentionning the use in phonetic notation. Given how people have always tried to create phonetic symbols from what was available, this isn't surprising. In fact, I have noticed the partial derivative symbol being used for the schwa before, and probably for the eth also. This in my mind is as disgraceful as using a German Eszett for the beta. But using the partial derivative symbol for the dental affricate has a certain logic to it.\n\n"
