  "content": "I might have missed threads discussing this, but is anyone else having problems with Typophile's search facility?\n\nTo find certain threads, I am having to track my own posts/comments to find them. When I do a search or advanced search, the results now seem more limited following Typophile's recent overhaul.\n\nIn one case I can find a thread via my own tracking, but it is not even listed within the forum topic. For example, thread: [http://www.typophile.com/node/20091](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017222639/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20091 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/20091\") exists but when I looked for it by name under 'Special Interest Groups' \\> 'Typographic Education', I can't see it listed there.\n\nIf it's me or my browser, please ignore me. But is anyone else experiencing similar issues?\n\nThanks.\n\n",
