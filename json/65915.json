  "content": "**This week's battle: Design a new logotype for digg. ( [digg.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140413060557/http:/www.digg.com/))**\n\nLet's show our friends over at [digg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140413060557/http:/www.digg.com/) what a logotype could look like when designed by typography experts.\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May the best designer win.\n\n// REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Solution must be typographic and contain the letters \"digg\" in lowercase.  \n- Letters must be custom drawn. No use of existing fonts!  \n- Image size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi\\*  \n- Color: Black and White  \n- Format: PNG, GIF or JPG (Preferred in that order. Mmake sure there are no spaces in the name)\n\n\\*Please try to keep your file sizes to a minimum! 50k per file max.\n\n// ABOUT TYPOPHILE TYPE BATTLES\n\nThis is your chance to flex your type muscles on a weekly basis. You have one week to create and submit your entry. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nAs with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize — only the ability to call yourself the best on the block.\n\nLink directly to this battle: [http://www.typophile.com/battle39](http://web.archive.org/web/20140413060557/http:/www.typophile.com/battle39 \"http://www.typophile.com/battle39\")  \nLink to the battle directory: [http://www.typophile.com/typebattles](http://web.archive.org/web/20140413060557/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles \"http://www.typophile.com/typebattles\")\n\n",

      "content": "Reasons to like the current logo:\n\n1. Boxy appearance makes it work very effectively if you think of \"text as user interface\", i.e., a call to action button. In fact, I would say that Digg does a poor job of capitalizing on that fact by NOT using the logo on the myriad \"Digg this\" buttons on the interwebs.\n2. There are no shadows, gradients, reflections, swooshes, spheres, whitsits or whatsits\n3. The logo reproduces well on ALL mediums, works as a single color, and works positive or reversed\n4. The overt technical connotations of the bitmap-esque letterforms are appropriate to the concept of \"repository of web resources\"\n\nWhat they should replace is that stupid icon of the dude with a shovel, which is barely recognizable even at large scale.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140413060557im_/http:/typophile.com/files/about-diggguy_5406.gif)\n\n"
