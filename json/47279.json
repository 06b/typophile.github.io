Contrast between hot (weather/sun) and cold (icecream) perhaps?

Keep it simple simple simple simple.\n\nGet all your ideas down on paper - develop those you think have potential, then present two or three polished concepts to the client.\n\nJust out of interest, who is the target audience?\n\n"

Instead of trying to make ice cream balls, you might want to play with the roundness of the “S”, “O” and the cone. At first glance I read it as a ice cream type of company. You just need to work on the readability of the ISO. Good luck. Look forward to your progress. mg\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032653im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/iso_6236.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032653im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/iso_5857.jpg)\n\n"
