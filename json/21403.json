  "content": "Hi all.\n\nI've been charged with designing the logo/branding for an online company whose aim it is to help sell independant art products for designers and artists worldwide. The idea is that artists can set up their own online store selling their wares -- so it must be quite a versatile brand.\n\nMy first three ideas are below -- any and all comments would be most appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064203im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-01_5009.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064203im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-02_3944.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064203im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-03_5867.gif)\n\nThanks in advance all,\n\nJordan\n\n",

I see where you're going with the red cherry-like dot, but to me it doesn't quite work.\n\nThat little ligature looks almost like a cherry stem, and the ball terminal of the 'c' would make an excellent red cherry. Maybe another one hanging off the 't' in another direction would also work (you might be able to cut it off the \"it\" ligature). These are just suggestions. They might not work as well as I hope.\n\nI think you definitely need to hide a cherry or two in the logo somewhere. To me a cherry has a distinctive heart shape and a stem.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

You may be right about the bar though; in all honesty, I think the bar is a bit of a cop out anyway, only there to prove I can do more than just string two words together ;)\n\n**tonicastro** : too commercial? in that you think it's not appropriate for an arty/independant company?\n\n**Lex** : I know what you mean about Mrs Eaves -- I feel the same -- but this is the first project I've ever considered using it where it _felt_ right. Your idea for converting the ligature into a pair of cherries is brilliant, but I fear not practical. I could be wrong, I'll try it out.\n\nRe: The dot in the first logo: Is it just a bit too big/prominent? Or is it just it's existence at all. I rather like it ... but then I did put it there :)\n\nI forgot to mail the PSD to myself at work, so I can't play with them now, but I will later on. Thanks again for your input, and to everyone else, don't hold back!\n\nJordan\n\n"

I also feel that the ct ligature is a bit limp compared to, for example, [Adobe Caslon's](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064203/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-caslon/).  \nI think that the spacing should be consistent, it needn't be a full word space, once you have finalised(ish) the kerning for the other characters you could try a number of spaces, my guess would be that you could use quite a thin space and still achieve separation of the words, (I also don't object to your initial separators although the baseline needs raising for the dot).  \nThe dusty red you have chosen seems a little lacking in comparison to the rich dark red of a cherry, however, screen quality could be contributing to that.  \nTim\n\n"

I agree about the lack of flair in the ct lig, but I've tried Caslon/Jensen and aside from the x-height being too large, I think they lack the personality of Mrs Eaves. Excellent spots with the kerning issues, you're absolutely right.\n\nI also agree about the shade of red -- I've found it very difficult trying to come up with a shade of red that seems cherry-ish: with anything from almost black to a pale crimson being appropriate. I think it could definitely do with a little more vibrancy though -- if for no other reason than to give more contrast between it and the black.\n\nI've tweaked the kerning, reduced the space between the words, fattened out the y descender, and given the shade of red a kick up the backside.
