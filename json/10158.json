Somewhat mannered, but still extremely capable.   \n   \nI personally wouldn't call Cronos a copy, but I think it does \"rip off\" some significant innovations from Today. And it doesn't make me happier to see Adobe get a TDC award for it, not to mention a \\*patent\\* on it. (But they also got a patent on \\*Garamond\\*, so...)   \n   \nHere's something too:   \n [http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/cronos.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414093409/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/cronos.html)   \n   \n\\> Slimbach & Co.'s Myriad always seemed like a Frutiger \"appropriation\" to me   \n   \nAnd to Frutiger, from what I understand.   \n   \n\\> Today is the most tightly-spaced sans I've ever worked with.   \n   \nThat's actually a good thing, even -no, especially- in text setting. The letters have to meld into words (they have to become less letters).   \n   \nI've come to believe that contemporary standards of spacing are too loose. The metal boys couldn't space much tighter than they did - but we can. There is certainly such a thing as too-tight spacing, but Today I feel is just right.   \n   \nAnd I'll note here that the good readability of Times is due to its very tight spacing - overcoming its deficiencies (which could be attributed to its unintelligent conversion to digital) in terms of lightness and contrastiness.   \n   \nTight tracking in headlines is largely a matter of taste - but in headlines, largely function.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Seeing the s with its beaks still intact, for example makes the d etc. look like they need their serifs. Another example would be the c, with its ball. Right now these characters, which basically have escaped modification do make the face feel closer to the serifs than other sans-romans, which is part of the charm of the face. I do think they could be toned back to match the other characters, though. I would definitely try to keep a two story g, for example, but the terminal on the top of the f could be sheared off, or treated differently.\n\n"
