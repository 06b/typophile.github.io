  "content": "My first discussion topic - hope it's in the right place here . . .\n\nI'm currently working in an environment where Myriad is the face for the organization.\n\nI'd love to have some advice on applying this face in a university setting.\n\nIt's paired with . . . Trajan. And the alternate fun face is Scriptina.\n\nI know.\n\nOne of my questions concerning Myriad is, why no extra light or thin? Does anyone know? And can you suggest something that will substitute in that usage?\n\nAnd any advice on using Trajan on a day-to-day non-movie-poster basis is always appreciated.\n\nThe bonus question would be whether or not there's an alternate alternates font for Scriptina that contains useful lowercase alternates - you're sensing the time already spent creating these by hand, aren't you?\n\nThanks in advance folks.\n\n",

      "content": "I wish that Myriad had a lighter variant too. I might use it more if it did.\n\nTrajan, although a bit too common for my tastes, is beautiful typeface. All of the Renaissance types like Garamond and Jenson have their uppercases modeled after similar inscriptional styles. As such, try to think of where you would use all caps Garamonds or Jensons, which would usually be in titling.\n\nIf you use Trajan for titles, and Myriad for the body copy, you might have something.\n\n"
