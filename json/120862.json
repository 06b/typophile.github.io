  "content": "Hi,  \nI was interested in what fonts people associated with  \na) Cinema and film  \nb) French Cinema and film through History\n\nI understand this is wide open to a lot of interpretation!  \nIf it helps the cover will include a still from the French film \" The Artist\" (Black and white film, but made in 2011).  \n [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655442/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415100608/http:/www.imdb.com/title/tt1655442/ \"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655442/\")\n\nThe client has asked for a bold modern cover (ha).  \nThough the actual film is a modern interpretation of a silent movie.\n\nCheers,\n\nJason\n\n",

Some interesting covers developing.  \nOne font that is looking nice is Parisian BT .  \nI also think the Jean-Luc Godard’s font could look really interesting used really big and covering most of the image. I doubt the publisher would go for it, but I will try it in any case. Because you never know.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Nick,\n\nThanks for sending me Excoffons way. I know some of his fonts but had no idea they were by a French Foundry/designer. Mistral looks a bit American to me for some reason.  \nThey are the sort of fonts I would dismiss often as they are so unique/different.  \nThat is very often a reason for using them of course as design is often about making a statement/making something unique. Banco is a really interesting one.\n\nHi Kthomps5,  \nThanks I will have a look at your link. I have done a layout already using the Jean-Luc Godard face.  \nIt's certainly got power on the page and looks really modern somehow. Seems a little similar to Knockout.  \nDon't know if I can do the kind of Justification Jean-Luc uses in his title sequences though.  \nIt just doesn't sit well to my eye, though many designers would disagree.\n\n"

To him I’m especially grateful for his intricate review of type in the film The Artist. For a very long time I feel that lettering and type is awkwardly neglected by film makers, mostly.
