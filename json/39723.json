Be the Difference._ It’s a new printing of almost exactly the same book; and because there’s no substantial change, they decided not to call it “2nd edition”. It should be heading to the printer any day now. It’s to be published by the organization Communication Across Barriers, out of Oregon.\n\nThe original book, which may or may not still be available, is a spiral-bound affair that _does not_ use Bembo; so you’re not interested in that version. But the new is to be perfect-bound and, I said, should—hopefully—be going to press momentarily. The hold-up is a problem with some art throughout the book, which their printer tells them is “too dark.” So they’re having the artist who created all this art for the first book, and which they reused for the second, look into it.\n\n"
