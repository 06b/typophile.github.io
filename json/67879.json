For all others, that means, 99% of the folks offering fonts (from rubbish to high quality) that busines is a mess.

Even those: how long \\*will\\* they pay the rent? Nobody knows.  \nI have fonts to offer from under $10 up to $300 (package); all do sell but I’m far from earning a living from it. However, if you have spent about ten years on the development of a typeface, like I did, you won’t just drop it because of bad sales.\n\nIf you think of earning money, don’t think of making fonts.  \nAnd vice versa.\n\n"

More expensive families sometimes sells one item a month but the amount can be higher that the monthly total of a good selling single font. I think it a good strategy not to offer families in single weights but in small packages. If someone really want or need a font he will buy the pack.\n\n"

But it would be a slow way to get started now. Having a \"hit\" helps (mine was Fontesque), in fact that's what led me to believe that type design was a viable source of income.  \nSo if you are starting out without a hit, it's a bigger commitment, a bigger leap of faith now.\n\nOne advantage of e-commerce is that you don't have to live downtown in an expensive city to service clients.  \nI recently moved to a small town. People ask if I retired.  \nActually, I read an article in Design Edge magazine that some hip young Toronto graphic designers are moving out anyway.\n\n"

      "content": "I'm a bit leery to put my two cents in here because I've been fortunate to make a living at it.\n\nI'm not sure why though. I know that some of my fonts are popular, but I'm not sure what makes a font popular. I tend to create things that interest me, but since this is my livelihood, I also create things that I think other people would like to have. When I design what becomes a popular font, it tends to have a snow ball effect. The more people see it used, the more they want it.\n\nAnd the popularity of one font can lead to the sales of other less known fonts. The question is, \"What makes a font popular?\"\n\nLook at this example... I have done some work that frankly, I think is mediocre, but does well... while there are other things I've done that I am so much more proud of, from a creative point of view, and they seem to fall through the cracks.\n\nThe font that I've been updating lately (see the Polish ł thread) is called Corinthia, and it's sales have done quite well. While I'm grateful that it's popular, I know it isn't my best work. In fact, I'm a bit horrified with some of the decisions I made when I first created it many years ago. That's why I decided to update it recently.\n\nOn the other hand, one of my favorite fonts is called Babylonica, and it's not well known at all and thus hasn't sold well.\n\nHaving said all of that... it's quite possible that the name of the font has a lot to do with its popularity, and so it sells. Another font that has done well for me is called \"Inspiration.\" Could it be the name?\n\nI'd be interested to hear other people's thoughts on the naming of fonts. The process by which one comes up with a name.\n\nRob\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214011336im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sale_font_5204.png)\n\n"

      "content": "I actually think the marketing aspect of a typeface is most crucial. Granted, I haven't sold a typeface yet myself because I haven't finished a professional one yet. However, I've purchased typefaces and I've realized I ignore many typefaces simply because of the bad way it's marketed. For example, on myfonts.com the section where you can try out the type is brilliant to get a clear picture of what you get, but it doesn't show what you can actually do with it in terms of design (composition, color etc.), and in case the typeface has OpenType features, it can only show the very basic ligatures and nothing more, not to mention the errors some typefaces present with certain letters with punctiation (rare case though). The gallery section of myfonts.com is therefor essential to sell the typeface. Jos Buivenga seems to understand the impact of proper marketing, from his indvidual typeface presentations to the exljbris website itself. I'm sorry to say, but most of the people who posted in this thread - regardless of how many licenses you've sold already - haven't mastered that aspect yet. I really think it's the essential part.\n\nThe name of the typeface is secondary to the presentation, but still quite essential. I wouldn't recommend the use of double vowels (oo, aa etc.), but I do recommend the use of 2 or more different vowels whitout making the name unnecessarily long. Every vowel has a different psychological impact and association, so you might want to take that into consideration as well.\n\nAs for the process of coming up with a name, I can imagine it's very different for everyone. I often search for obscure words and change them to my liking. I generally think words that have no obvious meaning work better. A typeface I'm working on is called \"Célente\" . The use of an acute accent isn't a smart thing, so I might remove it before releasing it, although I'm a bit afraid the pronunciation wouldn't be as intended then. In any case, it's a combination of \"celeste\"/\"celestial\" and \"silentium\" from one of my favorite aphorisms \"silentium est aureum\" (silence is golden). It's also smart to choose a name that contains one or more letters of your font that you would consider best, or characteristic for your typeface.\n\n"

Text converted to outlines print a slight bolder, so this is not a good option?

I have. Quite a good one actually. The type business is, well, a business, and a lot more complicated than most of you are aware of. When these threads came up in the past it always amused me that all the naysayers on earning a living in the type business were not in the type business. Thankfully this thread is taking a bit of a different track.\n\nWhat I find really interesting is that on Typophile the same dozen or so type designers names come up, as if they are the only ones whose work is of interest, but there are so many people in this business making a good go at it, whose names are hardly ever mentioned.\n\nAs to worrying about your pdf samples.

An Estonian calligrapher, Villu Toots passed away in the early nineties, so I don't have the opportunity to ask him if it's ok with him.\n\nI know other fonts are named after well known typographers... so my question is, would I be out of bounds naming this new font after Villu Toots?
