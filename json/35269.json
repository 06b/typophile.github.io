I use [YubNub](http://web.archive.org/yubnub.org), which is a \"(social) command line for the web.\" I've integrated it into my address bar, so when I type \"gim porsche,\" IE searches Google Images for porsches, and when I type \"am Bringhurst,\" Amazon pops up with the matches. I made the command \"typophile,\" which works in the same way, searching Typophile.com through Google. So typing \"typophile wired magazine\" would do the same thing as what has been mentioned. The advantage of YubNub over the javascript is that there's no need to use a links or favorites bar if you don't use them normally (like I don't). Having it in my address bar has made my life a little bit easier (using commands like \"myfonts,\" \"veertype,\" and \"fontshop\" to search those sites for fonts).\n\n"
