  "content": "Hi!\n\nI have discovered the following which reminds me a lot of DIN but there are quite a few differences when you look closely at it.  \nI have performed a search using an image font identify tool but I didn't came up with a suiting result.\n\nDoes anyone else have an idea which font this might be? I have a feeling it's pretty custom.\n\nThanks for any help in advance.\n\nC.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025457/http:/typophile.com/files/font_381.jpg) | 29.43 KB |\n\n",
