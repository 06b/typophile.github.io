Think no keyboard - rather true, robust dictation   \ninstead; wireless; super long battery life, and no external   \nmonitor - a direct drawing interface screen like the Cintiq.   \nIn my recent search for a new system I took a serious look at   \nthe latest tablet PC's. However they only approach what I've   \nbeen waiting for as the specs still fall short, overall.   \n   \nI know this is tangential to your initial question but I thought   \nanyone interested in the Cintiq is forward-thinking enough   \nto perhaps share my vision.\n\n"

Paper, pencil and ScanFont are really the way to go here.   \n   \nThe highest resolution touchsceen I've seen is the NEC LCD2010X-T at 1280x1024. I don't think it has the pressure granularity that a Cintiq has. Public-use kiosks and specialized design tools are two different things.   \n   \nI'll reconsider Tablet PCs when Apple ships one.\n\n"
