I am excited to be able to sit down and hear about these processes directly from the horses mouth. It seems to me that in this day and age with all of the piracy that is going on something like this can only help us arm ourselves with the needed information to protect our work. I personally can't wait. Who else is attending these two sessions?\n\nFYI, here's the info for those who weren't aware!\n\nWorkshop:  \nCopyright Protection for Graphic Designers and Font Foundries: Myth and Reality  \nPresented by Frank Martinez (The Martinez Group)  \nThursday, August 2 | 9:00 am–12:30 pm | Cost: $50  \n [http://www.typecon.com/workshops.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20101224023109/http:/www.typecon.com/workshops.html \"http://www.typecon.com/workshops.html\")\n\nEducation Forum:  \nLicensing Fonts and Software in an Educational Environment  \nThursday, August 2 | 11:00 am–6:00 pm | Cost: $50  \n [http://www.typecon.com/education.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20101224023109/http:/www.typecon.com/education.html \"http://www.typecon.com/education.html\")\n\n",
