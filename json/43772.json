  "content": "Hello,  \nI am looking for a digital font that is close to this sample, printed from metal letters. The lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ are pretty distinctive.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131209102755im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gothic_3475.gif)\n  \nI found [AT Gothic Extended](http://web.archive.org/web/20131209102755/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atgothic-extended/) from Agfa/Monotype – which actually is very good. Alas, there seems to be only one single weight available (Extra Light). Do you know a font with a similar appearance that has more styles?\n\nThank you,  \nFlorian\n\nedit: I came across [Adrianna](http://web.archive.org/web/20131209102755/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/adrianna/). It offers a wider range in weights, but has some disadvantages, too: considerably smaller x-height and some wayward characters: c, e, g for example.  \nAnd I saw [this old thread on Splendid Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131209102755/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38174) – Erkki, are you still around?\n\n",
