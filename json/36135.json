  "content": "Hello all,\n\nWell here is a good one for anyone who wants a challenge!\n\nI am currently designing an advert in which the headline copy is a transcript from a phone conversation. Initially I thought about a handwritten typeface to make it look more relaxed, informal, etc. Most typefaces that I found are not quite right as they are too stylised or the balance between the characters are too eratic.\n\nSo The question I am setting...\n\n**Can anyone recommend a typeface that 'looks' spoken?**\n\nMany thanks  \nJavier\n\n",

The site itself is being bratty right now (they predict repairs by next week), and as with all free fonts, you want to check out what you're getting closely before you get it, but you might find something you like in there.\n\nPersonally, I like [Komika Hands](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014040525/http:/dafont.com/komika-hands.font). Mmmm ... alternates...\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, you could graph the waveform of a voice recording and adjust the height and width of the letters in the text to the corresponding shapes, I'm not sure a handwritten font would work so well for that, though. A boxy sans might be easier to deal with.\n\nWith some sophisticated scripting, you might be able to use the sound data directly in modifying type, in which case use whatever style of letter you like. I'm no programmer so don't ask me how you would do this.\n\n"

      "content": "\"Can anyone recommend a typeface that ’looks’ spoken?\"  \nThe short answer is, any typeface that has quotation marks would do something of the sort (so to speak). \"Does this look spoken?\" Hope so.:) Sure, you can throw a speech balloon around anything and make it \"spoken\" as well... or can you?... There is a much longer answer that goes back to the notion that all type selection is a choice between one \"tone of voice\" and another. This has broken up a bit with the advent of fonts popular because they include in their design predefined faults associated with poor output (grunge) or limited compositional capabilities (monospace or stencil). Some of the examples above with grunge in a balloon make the point quite well that the more personality in the design, the less range of spoken word can be effectively carried, even _with_ a balloon. Another example of this would be to visualize the stencil font appearing elsewhere on your screen in either quotes or a balloon. How many tones of voice would that carry effectively? So what looks spoken? Or what doesn't look spoken? Point size and other composition requirements are important obviously, but just what tone of voice is to be conveyed should be explained before a range of choices could possibly be explored, in my opinion. If on the other hand a speech balloon is inevitable, then comic book lettering is going to be the choice through sheer familiarity of the user.\n\n\"...speak into a mic and see what comes out...\" lol, good luck. Or I should say, reverse it (at least in your mind), and try making a tone of voice for just a few 1000 fonts.\n\nCheers!\n\n"
