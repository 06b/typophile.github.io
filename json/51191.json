For my english classes I had Font, Size, Spacing, Margins all required to be specific values. We didn't get marks off if it was wrong, in my school if it was wrong it didn't get marked. The end.\n\nI'm gonna make a suggestion, don't tear me apart on this one. For me, when I look at Neutraface, it reminds me of the same feeling as Futura and Century Gothic. (especially the Capitals) Check to see if you have Futura or Century Gothic already, you often have one of the two pre-installed.\n\nBest of luck,  \ninnovati!\n\n"
