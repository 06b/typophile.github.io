  "content": "This happens in FL 5.0.3 for Mac:\n\nAbout half of the kerning is lost (mostly the pairs that are not classes) when having OT-classes also in the font.\n\nThe kerning looks OK in the metrics panel, but when generated or updating the kern feature it shows that all kerning is not present anymore.\n\nIf I take away the OT-classes, the whole kerning is back again when I generate \"kern\" feature.\n\nIn this case it was smcp1 + smcp2.\n\nCould anyone try and see if they have the same bug?\n\n",

      "content": "I've had funnies with revisiting a font in FontLab 5.0.2 on a PC as well, but thought it was just me. Instead of losing pairs, I usually gain them -- but the new ones are unwanted & wrong. May just be something I do & not a bug.\n\nAnyway, my solution is to always save the features file, and put any new kerning in that file, read it back in & recompile. I put my classes in the feature file as well, so my starting point in a \"revisit\" situation is always a .vfb with no classes.\n\nIf I add kerning by using the FL metrics window (when revisiting), I write off an .AFM for pairs kerning, search & replace to get it into the proper syntax, & paste into the features file. For new classes or expanding existing classes, I just use the metrics window to determine the values. Then write these values into the features file \"kern\" feature in the appropriate places, read the features back into the .vfb, & recompile. Takes time, but seems to work. Just remember to say \"NO\" when the program tells you the \"features file & metrics window kerning don't agree, do you want to rebuild?\"\n\n"

Could you please fix that bug to, it would be great.\n\nAnother nice thing you should put in the metrics window, is an integrated OT-feature window aswell. In that case, small caps could be kerned visually so much more easier? Just type a word and click \"small caps\" and the small caps can be kerned in the same window. Or any other feature aswell.\n\nThanks for a wonderful application otherwise! It is my best friend nowadays.\n\n"
