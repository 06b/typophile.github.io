It seems like egyptienne  \na slab serif typeface is heading in the  \nright direction. The didot logo appears  \nto be too \"high class.\" I need to make it  \nfeel more youthful, without using a sans  \nserif typeface.\n\nI still have some kering issues and  \ncomposition problems, but I really need  \nto decide on a primary Logotype.\n\nI would like to hear your reactions on the logo,  \nand suggestions on the typography.\n\nThanks,\n\nDerrick\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201050336/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_164.png) | 258.04 KB |\n| [Picture 4.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201050336/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%204_51.png) | 135.96 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Besides being apparently youthful, what kind of music is it? And why the ban on sans? That slab you're using looks clean, but it's not exactly youthful... And that \"Q\" is lame; it's meant for setting multiple lines of caps (and not having them crash) so you might like to replace the tail with something more... youthful. :-) Maybe make it curl backwards into the space between the two words below. And why keep the \"2010\" in Didot? You could use a different font, but the Didot is clashing with the Egyptian.\n\nBTW, that island illustration is beautiful, but the first thing that popped into my head is making the island outline look like it's emanating sound waves - you know, vibrating out. Or is that what you've already done? Because it looks more like a typical topographic map - maybe too literal for a place that's not actually an island (at least not geographically :-).\n\nhhp\n\n"

I had originally had a sans  \nserif typeface, but my professor wanted me to try some  \nexploration with the serifs. I mean, I could attempt to  \nremove the bowls and counters, or something to that  \neffect for a more youthful feel.\n\nThe \"Q\" is very lame! Ha ha, I will try to do something  \nwith that. I am going to create some sans serif logotypes  \nand post them.\n\nI had originally intended to put the sound waves into an  \nafter effects commercial, but I will try to incorporate that  \ninto some future renditions of the logo. Thanks for pointing  \nthat out.\n\nThanks for your help, I really appreciate the feed back!\n\n"

First example will work poorly in black and white situations for example and in small sizes. Second example has problem that first also has - too many details that will loose eventually when applied, especially, again, small sizes.  \nHave you tried printing them?\n\nAgain, you could use these as visuals or graphics on banners, flags, other print material in big sizes but using festival's wordmark as a logo. You are trailing yourself a good path creating identity - identity that doesn't relies only on logo but on some kind of wordmark and set of graphics, visuals, illustrations (how do you want to call them).\n\nHope it is clearer now.\n\n\\_\n\nSandro\n\n"

      "content": "I think that you couldn't make two version because in start this is not really a logo. Printed it would look like a black/grey stain or smudge of colors. You have a mark that is not actually a mark, it is free floating graphics/visual and it is too large in relating to type. So you wouldn't really benefit in the end.\n\nSecond tought is to start again, from scratch making a simple logo or on other hand creating something that has same idea - set of visuals that later combines with wordmark and thus applying it to business cards, memorandums and then banner and so on.  \nSorry, I cannot remember now of identities of extended visuals combined with wordmark.\n\nDefine your problem at first, and then decide what to create and which way to go. Music and festivals are great projects to work for.\n\nGood luck.  \n\\_\n\nSandro\n\n"

But I went over to the HTF website and tried it - just felt a bit modern to me. I also tried Giza over at MyFonts.com and almost liked it - that's more the direction I was thinking of.\n\nOne thing I have learned from doing exactly what you're doing right now (asking others for their opinions) is that it can get very confusing. So I hope that doesn't happen, ultimately you need to execute YOUR vision, not mine.\n\nAll that being said, I think something a bit retro and irregular would work better.\n\nBTW - I've done a few logos for music festivals and I ended up drawing all of them. It also helps when someone cannot easily imitate the trademark for an event.\n\npbc\n\n"

Try to explore folk music, folk art maybe, try to find visuals, patterns, try to find its identity, try to find everything about Presque isle regarding the folk music. Sans or serif, it is all up too you, depends on feel and how do you want to communicate.\n\nI see that you cut the type part of your visuals but again, this cannot go into logotype/wordmark box:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201050336im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logotype_4433_4989.jpg)\n\nThink of ratios of all elements that you combine. Year, place, these thin lines and shapes are all too small, and you are going into decoration with all these elements. Design is not just formalism and technicality.\n\nOther thoughts are that you could go with primary, secondary and maybe tertiary versions of logo. Adding place and date in secondary versions or in tertiary.\n\n[http://gapersblock.com/transmission/pitchfork-music-festival.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201050336/http:/gapersblock.com/transmission/pitchfork-music-festival.jpg \"http://gapersblock.com/transmission/pitchfork-music-festival.jpg\")\n\nThis logo communicates, good example is combining the year that is differentiated from name with color.\n\np.s Animal please when you type don't use forced lined brake with enter, it gets very hard to read what you have written.
