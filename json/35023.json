It seems like Aardvark is pretty well respected.\n\nDoes anyone recommend a different company or have any comments or advice on where to go?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Which however is exactly the reason my rates are also not monumental. :-) On the other hand I try not to skimp on taste or quality; here are a couple of (rather poor) shots of something I printed last month - my new business cards:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140350im_/http:/typophile.com/files/newcard1_4755.jpg)\n\n(The back of the card is burgundy matching the color of the logo.)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140350im_/http:/typophile.com/files/newcard2_5362.jpg)\n\nJonathan, I would be quite glad to take on your letterpress project.  \nPlease email me at your leisure: hpapazian\\_at\\_gmail\\_dot\\_com\n\nhhp\n\n"
