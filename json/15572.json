I only consider OpenType fonts, for reasons other people have explained much better than I could; but I'd add that when it comes to non-Latin you'd be a fool to not use Unicode-encoded fonts.\n\nAdobe Minion Pro and Myriad Pro are as good in their Greeks as they are in their Latins; ditto Warnock Pro, for a different kind of documents. More interesting (and for an entirely different category of documents) Garamond Premiere Pro -- also, the only truly complete character set in the stable, with full polytonic and small caps.\n\nHelvetica Linotype is a cut above its siblings, if you're looking in that direction.\n\nVictor Gaultney's Gentium supports polytonic Greek (and is free).\n\nThere's also a small operation in Seattle with some very good -- albeit monotonic -- Greeks under its belt, but I haven't seen the fonts retail yet; my guess is they'll end up bundled with some piece of software or other.\n\n"
