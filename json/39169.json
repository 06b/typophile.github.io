Especially since in the newsfeed section it doesn’t list specifics.  \nSo when you change your status to “engaged” to a good female friend to help her alleviate the embarrassment of breaking up with a long term boyfriend, you start receiving congratulation cards in the mail because no one bothered to check if you were -actually- engaged to your boyfriend.....\n\n"
