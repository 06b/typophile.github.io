Yes, but Maria has to factor in what percentage of her readers that will be - and chances are it's very small.\\* If it's done right, I think most people will either not notice consciously or they'll think something along the lines of \"Hey, this printing is artsy\". :-) And some graphic designers are likely to actualy like it consciously. Also, the fact that some people will think \"it's a mistake\" could be a conversation piece, especially if/when they end up finding out that it wasn't! For example maybe by reading a carefully-composed colophon.\n\n\\* And if somebody is savvy enough to think such a thing, he might be savvy enough to realize that that couldn't have been what was subbed in for a missing font (unless Maria's choice is very generic-looking).\n\nThat said, I do think that the \"resolution\" of the pixelfont has to be chosen very carefully, and not least based on the repro quality.\n\nMaybe we need to see a PDF?\n\nhhp\n\n"

A bigger reason would be a general increase in readability, since the bitmaps will have more fidelity to \"expected\" letterforms. But, as you imply, a critical element of deciding how coarse the bitmap font should be is the balance between \"flavor\" and readability, and that will only reveal itself through some good actual testing. It's possible the 12 will be too subtle at 10pt (although I doubt it).\n\n\\> In what ways do you think this can have a bad influence on legibility?\n\nGood question. I guess it comes down to deviating from \"ideal\" bitmaps simply to preserve the abstract character of the original (a character that does not necessarily promote readability of its own). I do think this sort of thing has value within a bitmap font family of multiple sizes, but trying to maintain it too much between bitmaps and outlines tends to backfire.\n\nhhp\n\n"

You mean it’s like trying to dissimulate the essence of a bitmap typeface.
