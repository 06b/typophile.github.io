  "content": "Hello, everyone!\n\nI need help identifying this type used on The September Issue. It was used for the names during the movie and on the end credits. I thought it was a really nice serif font with a bit of a nice odd touch with the capital 'C', which had like a small bulb hanging by the top end instead of a serif. They also appear on the ends of the capital 'S'.\n\nI did a search already but wasn't able to find an existing post.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nHere's a sample picture.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [The.September.Issue\\_.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-DiVERSE 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312203930/http:/typophile.com/files/The.September.Issue_.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-DiVERSE%201_0.png) | 71.1 KB |\n\n",
