  "content": "besides type i am obsessed with food. imagine that. in fact i'm currently working of my first book project for myself it it is going to be a book of family recipes. quite appropriate, i'd say, bringing together food and type.  \nbut all this isn't what i really wanted to talk about. i was at the grocery store the other day and noticed a [new magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20100711093521/http:/www.rachaelraymag.com/) by my favorite TV food personality, Rachael Ray. i just love magazines, but a few years back i was heart broken when my favorite design mag, One, was pulled after just one year's run. i'd be inconsolable if it happened again, so i'm sending out a plea for ya'll to check this one out, and if you feel so inclined, pick up a subscription so this one stays afloat and i won't be busted up.  \nthnx for reading, and as always, please take my rablings with a grain of salt (pun intended). :^P\n\np.s. bonus points for the first person who can correctly identify the fonts used in the nameplate (i'll send you a gift subscription on me!)\n\n",
