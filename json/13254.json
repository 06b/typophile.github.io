I am a freelance designer working from home so money is tight, but need a solid printer for client reviews.  \nAny responses would be greatly appreciated!\n\nTommy\n\n [‹ Notanotechnology](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012151710/http:/typophile.com/node/13291 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Hedera ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012151710/http:/typophile.com/node/13058 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I’ve gone through a number of cheap inkjets and haven’t found anything that comes close to epson for final prints or proofs. Their ink quality and the colors are just way better than anything else I’ve found. Like any inkjet, they have a number of issues to be aware of.\n\nThe most important problem is that the nozzles can clog and render the printer useless. This is best addressed by turning the printer off when it’s not being used.\n\nThe other, more immediate and chronic issue is the cost of the black ink. Personally, I have a little $60 Canon that I use for utility printing and save the Epson for when it counts.\n\nGood luck.\n\n"

It does, however, run banner paper which is fantastic. I’m cheap so I’ll keep running it until it dies.\n\n"
