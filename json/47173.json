It's essentially a one-man catering company that provides Spanish paella dishes and everything that goes with it.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a typeface that has a particularly \"Spanish\" feel to it. Can anybody recommend such a typeface? I've been looking at some Spanish art books, but couldn't find anything.\n\nThanks for any input in this matter!\n\n",

      "content": "I have seen some debate on Typophile as to whether a typeface can have any national character. Perhaps if you give a bit more information on the feel you are trying to evoke you might get more targeted suggestions.\n\nNevertheless, a standard suggestion would be to use something by an Iberian designer. If I associate something with Spain, it is a certain oldness and Baroque styling, so I might suggest Mario Feliciano's [Rongel](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=22) (taken from a Spanish model) or [Caligrafia de Bula](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_debula.html). Perhaps also [Lagarto](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/kimeratype.com/), [Lisboa](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/lisboa.asp) (some [new versions](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/vanarchiv.com/lisboa-introduction.html) are in the works, so you may want to [contact Ricardo Santos](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/vanarchiv.com/contact) to see if they are available), [Fleischman BT Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/fleischman-bt-pro), or [Borges](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/borges).\n\n"

      "content": "Out of the list of Reed's suggestions, I'd go with, in order of just how old he wants things to look:\n\nRongel (newer)  \nFleischman  \nLagarto (older)\n\nRongel is a good bit more contemporary but looks a little bit more formal (as Fleischman borders on oldfashioned) so if it's a very formal restaurant I'd go with Rongel. If a little less pricy of a restaurant I'd go with Fleischman. Lagarto maybe as headers could work. I definitely wouldn't use Lisboa, as it's called Lisboa for a reason, it perfectly captures that city but doesn't work for most any Spanish cities that I can think of (In general Portuguese design tends to be a bit lighter and rounder than that of Spain)\n\nIf you want to go handwriting wise for anything in the style of Spaniards, the key things to note:\n\ndots over the I even when capital, the 1s look more like ^, the 9s look like gs, the 7 and Zz always carry the bar through them, and the tilde looks like a macron over the n. The A often looks more like a delta (bottom left to top to bottom right and then a line either horizontal or diagonal to make the bar, butall in one stroke), the lowercase r often looks like an r rotunda (or a cursive r without the initial stroke, or a very small nob instead of the full stroke), the cursive f looks like an cursive esh, and the cursive z is like a print z with swoop and no cross (or a french 3). And they don't use cursive capital letters (as I quickly found out as people couldn't read half the stuff I wrote).\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

The company is essentially a one-man business of a Ukranian guy living in Germany and claiming to be Spanish. People can book him and he'll come over and cook a fabulous paella for them. What a shame that you guys can't try it... (I did last weekend!).\n\nMy current favourites are Lisboa and Borges. Unfortunately, due to the current workload, I cannot start with this project before end of next week. I'll post the first draft of my website + logo as soon as I can!

It all took several hundred years, which is about right for paella in a Ukraino-Germanic context.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

It also includes a logo which I made. It is based on the font Chaparral Pro, which isn't actually Spanish but does a fairly good job at this particular task I think. The focus in this project is on web design and photography anyway. There's no budget for developing a more complex brand identity.\n\nPlease let me know what could be improved further. Thanks for any input...\n\nP.S. Sorry for the site being in German only. But you will get the gist of it. It's just a chef specialising in cooking paella. Quite a simple concept actually!!\n\n[Webdesign Hamburg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021214/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n"
