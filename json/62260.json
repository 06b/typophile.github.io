      "content": "When I was looking at it for the first time, something seemed to confuse me. That's the reason why I took a screenshot and inserted a baseline and the x-height. The attatched screenshot kind of reveals the issues very quickly. First thing you have to do is achieving a better vertical alignment. Regarding to the baseline, all your letters -- except the \"a\" -- are just touching it instead of cutting into it, to balance the stem of the \"a\". Concerning the x-height, your \"a\" is way to small and should be raised up to the height of \"e\". All in all you need to take a closer look at the vertical alignment of round and straight elements. Maybe [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107161659/http:/typophile.com/node/61157) helps you understanding what I mean. Maybe anyone else knows a better example.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107161659im_/http:/typophile.com/files/blueblau_6016.jpg)\n\n"
