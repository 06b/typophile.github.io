Let’s just say I am being a devil’s advocate, for the sake of good conversation.\n\nI can’t say I really mind the exploitation of libido in advertising. It makes sense. I think the feeble teasing of ’FCUK’ was fairly lame compared to this, which has some subtlety, but that is irrelevant to the fact that either is a graphic innuendo.\n\nAlthough it probably sounds terribly new-fangled, a lot of people (mine, younger and older generations) I’ve grown up with enjoyed a variety of sexual activity, and some have found intimacy and meaningful relationships within and without that arena. Sex is a healthily rewarding expression of genetic drive. Love is about respect, trust, patience and some of our other higher traits.\n\nCuisine is a less dangerous sibling, because people don’t “carry the bloodline” with a perfectly-prepared lobster.\n\nIn marketing, one’s desire to be rewarded and recognized for effort, to belong to a community and feel wanted, and to feel secure are constantly promised. That is because it is what we want and if we think the product will give that, we’ll pay for it.\n\nThe funny thing is, all of these things these things you receive from those who love you. A lot of those people you never picked, but were handed by genetics, circumstance, etc. But there is one who loves you that you pick. Your mate. Partner/spouse/lover etc. Probably, the one you most commonly procreate with.\n\nSex is demoted to a symbol of love, instead of being recognized as its own weird thing. And thus, it becomes not a cheap and tawdry thing that is largely harmless, especially with modern technology and hygiene. It becomes a poor symbol of something great, complicated and inherently hard to sell. Marketers would be suicidal not to value sex so greatly.\n\n"

Sexual modernism has proven to be a huge failure over the past century, both in theory and in practice, and its current advocates are ignoring the lessons of the past century, and particularly the last 50 years.

Those who want to avoid it and the associated research in my opinion do so at their own peril.\n\nIncidentally, sexual modernists themselves would be split on the A-style logo. As the history book I linked to explains, there is a split between romantic modernists and ’pleasure ethic’ modernists. The romantic modernists want to keep love and sex together, but split those off from marriage. Pleasure ethic modernists, like Kinsey, are in favor of separating love and sex, regarding the pleasure from sex as being a higher priority. The romantic modernists would not like the logo, and the pleasure ethic ones would.\n\nIn my own view, both traditional, pre-1900 views and sexual modernism are passé and destined to the dustbin of history.\n\np.s.

This is interesting, and design is nothing without exploring the society in which it speaks. If you do, however, please do not marry either of us. :)\n\nI personally do not think so much of “Relationship/Sexual Modernism” that it is a valid solution to all weaknesses of prior models. Postmodernism has evolved because I am not the only one who thinks this way. Futura and OCR-A did not make serif faces obsolete, to draw a parallel. Today’s myriad of divergent faces is how thew world wants it.\n\nThe point I was suggesting above is that Sexual Romanticism, as well as Moral Romanticism, has had much more of an impact on the power of sex in advertising than Sexual Modernism has, by overemphasizing the bond of sex and love. Due to the sanctioning of marriage by other major institutions in the classical form, 19th century views have persisted alongside modern ones. Marketing exploits the weaknesses in the romantic model because they work, and they only work at that level we have permitted.\n\nMy prediction is that you will slowly see a new type of “postmodern” ethical distinction. An atomization of the facets that make up social living into tiny shards, that exist solely with the intention to be reassembled. This is a geeky example, but perhaps you might think of it as each person is a microkernel, with access to a million moral-memes to access and build into their identity. Each is developed discretely. Then one’s life would be the runtime compilation. This would mean the untangling of marriage, love AND sex from each other, then being refined and reintegrated. I am not saying I endorse this, just that it would mimic our behavior socially in other fields.\n\nIt may appear, one hundred years from now, that our use of sex to sell hemmeroid cremes, pickup trucks and lumber are nonsensical and quanint. I think it will likely take longer, due to biological issues, but I still currently hold Romanticism at fault more than the Modernist distinctions, for the power of sex in advertising.\n\n"

To look at your example, married people may report greater satisfaction in their sex lives, but it also seems to me that married people probably feel more pressure — internal, if nothing else — to validate their marriage and their sex life, given the climate you describe. (Validation of marriage is part of the inner game of marriage, as it were. One reason that young married couples are always telling unmarried couples to hurry up and get married.)\n\nI’d imagine that single people, who are not really beholden to anyone else, might be more honest in discussing dissatisfaction. I think that the pressure not to admit sexual dissatisfaction for a married person could be both very high, and possibly crucial to the success of a marriage. (Since not everyone can be sexually satisfied all the time.)\n\nIt’s quite possible that some kind of dissatisfaction with one’s sex life is built into the human condition, and married people just talk about it less. It certainly makes sense in terms of evolution — if the cup is 7/8s full at best, one is more likely to take advantage of other mating opportunities, and have more descendants. (cf. All kinds of books, but most interestingly Jared Diamond’s \\_The Third Chimpanzee\\_ on how human mating habits seem to fit this pattern.) Like depression, it could be that a low-level continuing thread of dissatisfaction (which is just part of the human condition) has effectively been pathologized, so that far more people are convinced that they’re dissatisfied in a way that others aren’t, and cannot talk about it.\n\nOf course, that sounds elementary, but I often think things that sound elementary haven’t been taken into account when people set out to do research. They often fail to see past the assumptions of their own culture or personal value system, if you know what I mean.\n\nFinally, the traditional picture of marriage as presented by those who think it’s the cure for social problems in the West seem to ignore all of the seedy underground infrastructure that made a monogamous marriage system actually function without recourse to divorce. London in the Victorian Era was teeming with streetwalkers and whorehouses, and so was 19th Century France. This pattern is much more visible if you travel in other societies, such as in Latin America or East Asia. In such societies, married women often sublimate sexual energies to other areas of their lives, and men get release outside the marriage on a semi-regular basis (and are expected to do so). The rise of divorce as an ostensible antidote to sexual dissatisfaction is problematic, but that doesn’t mean we didn’t have other distasteful antidotes to it in the past. We most certainly did, and still do.\n\n(If you don’t believe me, come to South Korea sometime. The sex trade is operating in literally every neighbourhood I’ve walked through in this country. And I’ve heard similar things about lots of other places, too.)\n\nBut all that said, I too am not all that happy about how crass all discussion and depiction of sexuality has become. We have a long tradition as humans of laughing about things we’re anxious about, and humans are naturally anxious about sex and sexuality, but there’s funny, and then there’s just crass. This strikes me as just crass. (Once I saw it. I couldn’t until I read the thread, though.)\n\n"

If you want to criticize their methodology, then you need to get specific. I have met and talked with a number of these researchers, and they are extremely aware of problems of distortions in self-reporting and selection effects, and try to avoid and compensation for them. And they are very aware that academic colleagues or those who politically disagree will rip them up in print if their methodology is weak.\n\nFor what it’s worth, they report that there is a ’honeymoon’ effect where a newly married couple is extremely positive about their partner and the marriage for the first few years, if I remember correctly. But in long married couples they are brutally honest.\n\nIf you’ve been married a long time, I think you will find this very credible.\n\nBecause I criticize sexual modernism, it doesn’t mean that I am holding up Victorian marriage as an ideal; it had a lot of problems, and sexual modernism was one reaction to them. I am saying that the current condition of love, sex, and marriage is far from ideal. The current situation will not last, and the only question is how it will change.\n\n"

I know, relationships and mores are not the same as software and the wwweb, but surely the lives of the coming generation are influenced by recent developments?\n\nBurke: _Am I missing something?

I really have a distaste for the mandatory covering of the women’s hair, as is the case for Christian nuns, Orthodox Jewish women, and traditional Muslim women. To me it is a supressing of women’s sexuality, and a subjugation of women. In answer to the traditional view that women are too tempting to men, I think my wife’s answer: “Control yourselves, men!” is apt.\n\nHowever, modesty becomes a woman. For if sexual allure is the main thing about a woman—eg Anna Nichole—it is demeaning and dehumanizing to the woman. So there is some kind of balance of modesty and allure that non-traditionalist women strike. This is an individual matter that each woman decides for herself. And it usually changes with age and station in life.\n\nAllure is one thing, and crass is another, though. We have a choice about how to treat sexuality, both in the public media and privately. We can either make it crass or raise it to a higher spiritual plane. When the public media are filled with crassness and coarseness, I think it does affect the tone of everyday life, and especially affects adolescents.\n\nAs far as humor, yes crass can be funny, as in Borat’s incredibly crass doings—funnier in the TV show than the movie, but a kind of perverse genius none the less. The A style logo is clever but not funny. And once recognized it sticks around as an image, being crass. Would you want your daughter or son wearing it? Would you want to wear it? We are innundated with crassness, so to me crass is not ’frank’ or daring, but just a piling on of the assaults to human dignity, compassion and beauty that we experience daily.\n\n"

And to be brutally honest, I’ve had more than my fair share of experiences of academics saying relatively self-evident things as if they were newfound truths... and relatively inane or wrong things without any apparent sense of how out to lunch those claims were.\n\nI have to say the crassness wouldn’t bug me so much if it stayed in the land of crap one inflicts on oneself... online. Once it’s on shirts, you see it all over and the crassness becomes more, well, widespread. There’s enough crap floating in the world. I’d rather see really beautiful things. (Yeah, crass crap can be enjoyable, but I’ll always take Bach over Britney Spears. Always. But some people like crass stuff. :) )\n\n"

However, simply dismissing research without looking into its quality is of zero help in the search for truth on an important issue.\n\nThe information on the comparative sexual satisfaction of married and unmarried comes from The National Health and Social Life Survey, done in 1992 on a sample of 3,500 men and women. You can read about the methodology [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122071927/http:/cloud9.norc.uchicago.edu/faqs/sex.htm). It was carried out for the US Department of Health and Human Services, by professors from University of Chicago and State University of New York at Stoney Brook, and funded by seven large foundations.\n\nThis survey is quoted also by sites on information about Gays, as it reports higher percentages of Gays than conservatives like to acknowledge. I cannot find on the internet any criticism of its methodology.\n\nThe survey is also the basis of a chapter in [The Case for Marriage](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122071927/http:/www.amazon.com/Case-Marriage-Married-Healthier-Financially/dp/0767906322/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2366700-8164814?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1173382577&sr=8-1) by Linda Waite and Maggie Gallagher. The [attack on the book](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122071927/http:/www.unmarried.org/case.html) by the political opponents don’t criticise this particular survey or the data that Waite and Gallagher use from it.\n\nI conclude from the size of the survey, the professionalism of the authors, and the lack of criticism of it that it is pretty sound.\n\n"

I don’t pass judgement on either.\n\n“Are there uses of sex in advertising that do bother you from an ethical point of view?”\n\nSex in ads isn’t the issue, but, rather, society’s reaction to it. And that varies wildly from culture to culture/country to country/city to city. However, the effectiveness of sex in advertising seems to stay relatively consistent regardless of the particular culture.\n\nSex in ads sometimes bothers me from an intellectual point of view.
