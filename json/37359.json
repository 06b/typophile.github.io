Now, after five years of extensive research, the European Committee for Uniformity of Type Design and Type Safety completed the research and presented legible-for-all-purposes-suitable-typeface. The typeface, named Euroface, was developed and studied through extensive design exercises, laboratory investigation and road tests. The result is convincing: Euroface is 42% more legible than Helvetica_”\n\n42% More legible than Helvetica? Oh my.\n\nI’d like to find a sample of it.\n\nThat may not be so easy though.\n\n[http://www.a-g-i.org/magazine/news\\_detail.php?id=252&cat=](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122832/http:/www.a-g-i.org/magazine/news_detail.php?id=252&cat= \"http://www.a-g-i.org/magazine/news\\_detail.php?id=252&cat=\")\n\n“_A German attempt to create one ’Euroface’ for the European road signs scored astonishingly high in legibility tests. However, until today the typeface has remained hidden in bureaucratic drawers despite its supposedly magical qualities._”\n\nRuss\n\n [‹ Hot or Not? - American Craft logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122832/http:/typophile.com/node/37360 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Chalet London 1970 similar typeface ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122832/http:/typophile.com/node/37366 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
