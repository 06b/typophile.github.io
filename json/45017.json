The real thing? Ahh! A good ol' Ideal Stencil Machine or a Marsh even!\n\nI'm looking for a Ideal Stencil Machine No2. If you ever passed by one in a shop and had a flash: \"wow i wish i knew a guy who would post on typophile and say he'd like that machine!\".  \nWell you now you know that guy, or at the very least you know a poster's name on a forum but close enough ;)\n\nSo yea lemme know if you come across one of those babies :)\n\nCheers!\n\nUgo\n\n",

Should get here bu the end on the month :)\n\nAre you a stencil afficionado yourself? I mean those brass stencil had to be great... if not usable they ought to be cleaned and framed!\n\nU\n\n"

If you are ever in Lunenburg Nova Scotia, the fisheries museum has a great display of stencils and stencil making equipment that used to be used in the canning plants to label boxes. They made some pretty elaborate ones.\n\nOccasionally the sign shop I work in makes large stencils for pavement markings, but we use a CNC router.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

The cutting area, eighteen by twelve inches, is already too small for what I want to do in the near future and I've been drooling all over the gravograph IS8000xp which cuts up to twenty four by forty eight inches.  \nBut for now, I like cutting stencils from mylar for use on canvases etc...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100522182025im_/http:/typophile.com/files/stencil_typophile_3572.jpg)\n\nIf I ever see an old skool stencil machine up around the Ottawa valley I'll let you know :)\n\n"

A diagraph bradley Jumbo model 1 3/4 and a Marsh Stencil maker (I don`t know which size of letter but I do believe it is 1 inch.)\n\nIs this something you are interested in?\n\n"
