Basically it's the same just flipped / mirrored and not all rounded.\n\nAfter lunch I went for a walk and within two minutes I saw a bus driving by with a huge logo similar to Stankowski's.\n\nHow important is originality really?  \nAnd... is similarity even avoidable? I don't think it is, but when becomes similar too similar?\n\n",

But obviously you don't want to simply copy someone else. Come up with your own design solution, and then search for logos (Google is handy) that might be similar — especially logos used by your client's competitors — to make sure you're not accidentally coming too close to an existing logo.\n\n"
