  "content": "Can anyone recommend some alternatives to American Typewriter, Courier, Prestige, Archer and other such fonts? Im looking for something with character, but equally it shouldn't be too fun. Im after 'Restrained character' - you heard it here first.  \nPlease pass on any links to fonts you like in a similar vein to those listed above.\n\nThanks :)\n\n",

I do also like Everson Mono (freeware: [http://www.evertype.com/emono/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402034957/http:/www.evertype.com/emono/ \"http://www.evertype.com/emono/\") ) and maybe i can use this as a starting point to create something similar. Hm.\n\nAltaira, i like you're font, i think it fits the restrained character description for sure... certainly something id consider if/when it becomes available.\n\nThanks everyone, anymore then keep them coming...\n\n"
