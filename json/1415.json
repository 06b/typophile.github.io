Would you want to design   \nthose for me? For free?   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091021113644im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif)   \n   \nBehind every beautiful typeface there is a person.   \nMark van Bronkhurst, who designed ITC Conduit in 1997,   \ndepends on the sales of his work (the types he designs)   \nfor an income. I don't think he'd appreciate it if the   \nfruit of his labour (and believe me: it takes a _LOT_ of   \ntime, work and dedication to design a succesful typeface)   \nwas given away for free, just as you wouldn't like   \nit if the logos you design were not paid for.   \n   \nI don't want to sound preachy, but this is the third   \nrequest for font piracy in a week on \"our\" board,   \nand I don't think I really like this evolution. It's   \nlike going to a jewelers' convention and ask where   \nyou could steal some jewelry. Get the picture?   \n ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20091021113644im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

As my local public radio station (WBGO) during a fund drive says, when you leave the grocery store you can't just say to the casheer that the guy behind me will pay for my groceries. It amazes me! Bither way, less than 1% of listeners to my public radio station are members. Dan\n\n"

I bought Dalliance because of its beauty (to me), and I'm thinking of buying Tarzana as well. Dan\n\n"

I work at a place that sells typefaces and we often get that response: \"HOW much!!??\" like it's a big shock when you tell them the cost. I think people (especially those of a certain age brought up on the wonders of the internet) expect a free ride too often. The trouble is, they will probably find Conduit for free on some dodgy freeware site. ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20091021113644im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)\n\n"
