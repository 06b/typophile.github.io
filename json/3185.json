Zapfino Extra's features work in InDesign; the older Zapfino had to be used manually. OT features mean that it can be used as intended in a professional app like InDesign and not just an OS utility like TextEdit.   \n   \nMake sense?\n\n"

The addition of OT tables fixes the one main issue I have with a design like Zapfino, so I applaud Linotype for their continued pursuit of this project. Perhaps when the correct tools are available, the next Zapfino will include both OT and AAT tables. And who knows, maybe even [Graphite](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525001131/http:/graphite.sil.org/).\n\n"
