We had a mention of it before here, and I believe one response was that it didn't match up that well, that the extra weights were gilding the lily, plus the price factor...I wouldn't mind ONE more weight to Sabon just for now and then, but not at that price. But I myself saw no particular problem with how it looked or matched the older family, just the price.\n\n"
