This one shows the percentage of emissions that every country has signed to achieve by 2012.\n\nOnce again I would really appreciate every input you could give me on this.\n\nThank you so much in advance\n\nPedro Monteiro  \n [http://whatype.wordpress.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824222956/http:/whatype.wordpress.com/ \"http://whatype.wordpress.com/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824222956im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kyoto3b_6230.jpg)\n\n",
