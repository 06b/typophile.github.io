  "content": "Ok guys I need help for a personal identity. Part of the concept is to show raw type. So here is a logotype Im designing. Its only on stage 1.  \nWell this is a weird logotype because its unconventional. Sort of a hybrid bearing serifs for the upper acscender and serif for the lower.\n\nAny help/comments is appreciated very much.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [name.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419065817/http:/typophile.com/files/name.jpg) | 34.61 KB |\n\n",

I would suggest that the s is a little out of character, but I can kind of see where you are going with it. You probably need to keep going with.\n\nCheers  \nJason.\n\n"
