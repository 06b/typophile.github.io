  "content": "I have used @font-face in a web page using BPdots-Squares (from backpacker.gr) and noticed something weird. The typeface is OTF and has a set of stylistic alternates for several greek characters (using ss01, salt, tilt and liga open type features to generate them). So, the weird thing is that while various browsers (namely, IE, Opera, Chrome and Safari) ignore the stylistic alternates (as it was expected), Mozilla doesn't (as shown in the example below):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020221349im_/http:/typophile.com/files/explorer_3951.png)\nExplorer\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020221349im_/http:/typophile.com/files/chrome_5891.png)\nChrome\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020221349im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mozilla_4736.png)\nMozilla (as you can see characters μ, ρ, φ, θ, β and γ are different - all of them are characters that belong to the stylistic alternates set)\n\nCan anyone explain why this might be happening?\n\n",
