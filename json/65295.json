      "content": "The boarding around the C is to close the the C itself. Dont know if this is just me, but i get attracted to the eye of the \"lens\" to quick. First i see that, then i see the overall view. Mayb you should integrate the photo a bit more. Dunno if it works tho :). The yg pair is indeed a bit odd. Maybe create a Y from the G. Or create a font that has the same corners as the camera, like riccard0 said.  \nHope it helped.\n\n"
