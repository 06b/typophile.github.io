It says Different By Choice, and the fonts I was given for my project don’t match what they’re using on their website. I can probably get this information tomorrow directly from them, but I lose a day (somewhat).\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Jack Planck FONT ID](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011133652/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44815 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Please ID this ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011133652/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44824 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
