  "content": "This site was announced during this year's Grammy Award's Show. Does the type world need something similar? There are a few sites that have similar information, but from my first browse through \"What's The Download\" it seems that maybe a more forceful stance could be taken. One initial idea, off the top of my head, would be a site to which all foundries could link. A site that would cover everything, explain everything.   \n   \nVery interesting.\n\n",

But they have a lot of cash they can throw at the problem.   \n   \nMaybe the people running the music biz see the waterfall ahead,they're just paddling backwards to milk as much cash out as possible before the plunge. It's not like they're gonna end in the poorhouse either way.   \n   \nIn the type world, we can only go up now! :-/   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

They are intentionally avoiding the forceful stance and I   \nthink it's a smart idea (for their agenda).   \n   \nNice idea, Tiff. I think \"downloading fonts\" is a good parallel to   \nthis in some ways, and educating the font-ignorant public can't hurt.\n\n"
