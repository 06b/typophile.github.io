  "content": "I am looking for a typeface that looks like its from those travel postcards like as in “Hello from California”... and the Type usually has picstures in the letters. The typeface doesnt have to pics in it.. but just the basic shape of those letters..(so I can put my own pictures in it).\n\nI tried to find a pic online in the last hour and cant come up with a sample image (I apologize). But if it helps... The type usually is usually blocked (maybe even slight perspective on it) and curved on the bottom.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nedit.. I found one!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [greetings.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829025309/http:/typophile.com/files/greetings.jpg) | 18.65 KB |\n\n [‹ Black or White Magazine \"Aquatica\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829025309/http:/typophile.com/node/18515 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Capitals with vertical stems where they should be angled - ITC Avant Garde Gothic w/ Alternates {Stephen} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829025309/http:/typophile.com/node/18511 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Depending on how detailed and refined you want the final design, it’s not really too hard, but as Stephen suggests, can look fake. With a little extra work it can look fine.\n\nHere’s a quickie... 12 minutes to execute including image/photo fills. It uses only the most basic menu commands in Photoshop 7.0 without touching or tuning type outlines.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829025309im_/http:/typophile.com/files/postcard-1.png)\n\n"
