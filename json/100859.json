  "content": "I don't have any particular reason or question in this post, I'm only writing it because I find it interesting that here in the Algarve, Portugal, there exist so many signs and ads from the 70s and 80s which use the 'fancy' font Jackson MN.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jackson8_4877.png)\n In the following pictures I captured some of the places where I've seen it, but I remember at least four more, in the north of Portugal, suggesting this 'mania' was not only in one or two design shops. Personally, I have to say that I find it quite unique, although I wouldn't really use it in any of the things I do.  \n1. Here the font displays 'móveis' at a furniture shop: \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jackson1_4362.jpg)\n  \n2. Here the sign reads 'snack-bar \"the caterpillar\"'. If I'm not mistaking, the tréma was used instead of the quotation-marks: \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Jackson3_4718.jpg)\n  \n3. Here is the logo of the Australian tissue company ABC: \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jackson2_6582.png)\n  \n4. Here we see a printers shop advertising: \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jackson4_4042.jpg)\n  \n5. A map of my hometown, which my father designed together whit a friend (the map, not the town): \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jackson6_4096.jpg)\n  \n6. A mistake in the above-mentioned map: \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jackson7_6621.jpg)\n here the V was accidentally swapped with a Y, so the near-by village of Alvor is 'Alyor'. The Y and V are very similar: \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jackson9_4474.png)\n  \n7. Jackson MN was so popular, that somebody even made a crude imitation of it on the wall of the municipal market of Ferragudo: \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jackson5_4217.jpg)\n. Sorry for putting in such large-sized images, you'll have to open them in another window. \n",
