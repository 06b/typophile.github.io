  "content": "Hello, I’d greatly appreciate your help with this one. My client need her logo re-created and she keeps telling me to use the “Papyrus” font. But this is not papyrus and I can’t find a font with a similar name. I have not only searched all my fonts but also looked at Dafont etc... I have even tried out the Whatthefont tool - with no success...\n\nYou can see the logo here: [http://www.eyeinnovations.net/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091121205341/http:/www.eyeinnovations.net/ \"http://www.eyeinnovations.net/\")\n\nThe font in question is the “Eye Innovations” logo.  \nThank you so much for your help.\n\nAmalthea\n\n",
