I always find it hard to create a good logo consisting of three words.  \ni was intending to go for a wordmark, but the client insists on having a depiction of a starfish in there! (which is easily to be mistaken with a star).\n\nso we have a symbol and three words!\n\nrefresh me with ideas/suggestions or simply blame me for being creatively stuck.\n\n",
