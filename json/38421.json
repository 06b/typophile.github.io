Its funny- there is a Tokyo scene fascinated by black american music and culture, a fascination that leads many to even put on blackface or a really dark tan and crimped and weaved hair. But I guess that’s okay- I’m obsessed with Japanese stuff. Kawaii stuff- I love your icon BTW.\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"

Maybe “woofin’” is meant to be ironic like “brick shithouse”, e.g.:\n\n<cite>That girl be woofin’, homes.<cite></cite></cite>\n\nOr maybe it’s a reference to the loyalty of dogs:\n\n<cite>Why you checkin’ out my girl, bro? She’s woofin’ wit’ me now.</cite>\n\nOr maybe it has to do with listening to Snoop Doggy Dogg:\n\n<cite>Q: What are you listening to?<br>\nA: I’m woofin’.</cite>\n\nWhich brings me to the concept of speakers - there’s tweeters and woofers. Maybe “woofin’” means “having a bass-like quality”:\n\n<cite>That beat be woofin’, homes.</cite>\n\n- Lex\n\n"

(Like American magazine VIBE and then there is a female version of VIBE called VIBE Vixen which isn’t any sort of slang, it’s just the name of a magazine) It features more fashion and makeup, etc. Woofin’ is not any sort of new slang as the original Woofin’ (which is still on sale) has been out for years now, and it certainly isn’t a reference to “brick shithouse” or Snoop Dogg. Don’t hurt your heads thinking too much into it.\n\nOn the Cawaii image I want to know what the big word “Cawaii” is written in. Not anything else because I have those in my comouter, but thanks for your help.\n\nSo does anyone know what the big “Cawaii” is written in?\n\n"
