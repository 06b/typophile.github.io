Notice also how tight the spacing is, how some of the characters are tucked under others. This is from the days when metal type ruled. Hand lettering was a popular way to overcome its limitations and get unique headline treatments.   \n   \nThe basic style is modeled on Caslon, but I don't think you will find any good matches among available fonts.\n\n"
