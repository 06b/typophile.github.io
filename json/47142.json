  "content": "Allow me to preface this post by mentioning that the logo I currently use was concepted about five years ago when I just began working with online media. At the time, I had just started using my ’Xenethyl’ alias and wanted to design a logo for myself. Looking around at other icons, I found myself very drawn to Eidos’ Hitman logo (as many of you gamers will likely realize).\n\nSince the original drafting of my logo I have progressed to the point where I now do freelance graphic and web work as a hobby under Xen Graphics Studios. The name comes partly from my online alias and partly from a play on the word ’zen.’\n\nMy backstory aside, I’m wondering if I may have taken too many visual cues from the Hitman logo in my personal design. If it’s not readily apparent, my logo is supposed to represent a stylized ’X,’ which, sliced in half, plays somewhat on the idea of zen and balance.\n\nOver the years I have really become attached to the original design, though in recent months I have felt the need to update it and make the curves and weighting a bit more balanced and professional-looking. At the same time, as I have become more involved in the graphic world I have gained an immensely high level of respect for designers and artists. That being said, the last thing I want to do is blatantly rip off Eidos’ hard work.\n\nWhat do you all think? Was I too inspired by the Hitman logo in searching for my own branding? Links to the Hitman logo, my current logo and revision mock-ups, and my proposed final revision can be found below. Just to be clear, the updated logo I am looking to implement is the third link.\n\n[Eidos’ Hitman Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203608/http:/www.xengraphics.net/misc/hitman_logo.gif)  \n [Original Logo Design & Redesign Mock-Ups](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203608/http:/www.xengraphics.net/misc/xen_v2_concepts.jpg)  \n [Revised, Final Redesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203608/http:/www.xengraphics.net/misc/xen_v2_revised.jpg)\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Logo critique needed ASAP](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203608/http:/typophile.com/node/47130 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo redesign for Pentecostal church ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203608/http:/typophile.com/node/46841 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "dezcom - I agree, brand confusion is not something that I want to deal with.\n\npica pusher - I think moving in a direction that makes the logo more easily distinguishable as an ’X’ would be a good idea. It would at least allow me to continue using the same style.\n\nvintagesignman - Thanks for the mock-up! I’ll see if I can play with the design a bit and move it more towards a recognizable ’X.’\n\nTiffany - I hadn’t considered the logo being faction-like, though I definitely agree with you. Maybe it was a sub-conscious thing...\n\nTrick - I too started to notice that while I was looking over the different variations. I think slicing the icon in half helps to reduce the mask imagery, but maybe a little more treatment wouldn’t hurt either.\n\nThanks to all of you that have posted your comments regarding this design. I really appreciate it.\n\nI’ll start working on some revisions and see if I can’t make this logo be more unique and recognizable.\n\n"
