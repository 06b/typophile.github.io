Was this one of those custom hand-drawn logos, or is it a font (based on a font)? Any help/answers are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance everyone!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MacGyver\\_iso.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141015155207/http:/typophile.com/files/MacGyver_iso.jpg) | 24.06 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "The show was on starting in 1985, which is mostly pre-digital for fonts, so I looked in books of film types (even though I don't know if this logo dates to the start of the show). I can't say I found anything that jumped out at me as the answer. The G and C are sort of like Copperplate Gothic, but with a Latin-looking serif, although the other letters seem to have only the barest suggestion (if any) of serifs. The closest typeface I found with a slightly similar G (Orchard Wide, in the Photo-Lettering catalog) was similar in general feel and letterforms, except that it had an A that was flattened on top, or had a top serif, as did most of the A's in other similar fonts. Many of these other fonts also had a leg on the R that was more separated from the stem, unlike your logo.\n\nI know my collection of film type references is far from comprehensive, but I was at a loss to find anything very close. This makes me want to say 'custom', and yet I wonder whether they would have cared enough to pay for custom lettering, given the transience and riskiness of TV series. Maybe someone with a better selection of older typefaces can pin this down, but if I was given the task of re-creating it, and the condition that I had to start with an existing font, I think I would use [TF Arrow](http://web.archive.org/web/20141015155207/http:/www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFArrow_2c5a.html), which I think was the closest in general shape I could think of. I'd have to modify the C and G, but I think it wouldn't be too much work, and might give something close enough to pass casual inspection.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
