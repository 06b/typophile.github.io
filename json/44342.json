To ensure compatibility between Office  \nsuites, later this year Microsoft will release an update to Office 2004 for  \nMac with a free license for the fonts for use in Office 2004. But Mac users  \nwho don’t have Office and want the fonts for use in Corel, QuarkXPress and  \nAdobe Creative Suite for design and publishing now have a way to license and  \ndownload them.\n\nMore info on the Microsoft ClearType Fonts can be found here:  \n [http://www.ascendercorp.com/ctfonts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080421215137/http:/www.ascendercorp.com/ctfonts.html \"http://www.ascendercorp.com/ctfonts.html\")\n\n",
