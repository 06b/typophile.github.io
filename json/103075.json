  "content": "Hi everyone,  \nWe recently released a new Corporate Design featuring Univers and Univers Condensed. It all works – great.  \nHowever the client s not willing to boy the 100+ licenses to get the fonts onto it employees computers for daily use on stationary etc.  \nSo now I am looking for a substitute that ships with the standard Windows 7 package and resembles Univers and Univers Condensed as closely as possible. Unfortunately I am working on a Mac so I don’t have access to the entire Windows 7 library to try it out myself.  \nAnyone have any ideas, maybe even faced a similar issue in the past?  \nAny tips or recommendations are highly appreciated\n\n",
