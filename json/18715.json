Think beyond mega-swashy scripts (although if you know of some interesting ones that aren't Edwardian, Bickham, Nuptial, etc., those are welcome too.) What are your personal faves? Thanks! -ecs\n\n",

THis way you can create your own ampersand the way you want it without the worry of it fitting in.\n\nAlso it becomes a lot more personal which chould reflect the wedding theme a whole lot better.\n\n"

I'm in a pre-pre-sketching phase of this.\n\nMatt, I think calling a whole piece of punctuation \"college trite\", to paraphrase, is a bit broad. I likely will be creating new type for this project, but I have to start somewhere. Whether or not I even use an ampersand is TBD, but interlocking letters that spell \"and\" in French is symbolic, even if it does tend to be more of a 'surface' concept than complex.\n\n"
