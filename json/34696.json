Look at the work of De Stijl for example.  \nI’m not sure how those are called in English, since it’s not my native tongue. :)\n\n"

Futurism had an Italian as well as a Russian branch. They are clearly related in some key ways.\n\n"

Remember, that photolettering (typositor) had not been introduced even in the West then, and the best “pre-made” type for headlines was wood, and a bit rough anyway. So if you wanted nice big lettering, you made original artwork, and that was true whether you were working in the capitalist West and wanted some neo-Renaissance thang, or were a Soviet radical.\n\n"

In the same line of text the width of a given character varied by as much as 20 percent (based on my non-scientific assessment).\n\nMy own conclusion: type was a rich part of the posters, but a secondary detail, kind of like movie stars’ teeth in the 1970s. =)\n\nI’ve since thought that making a Rodchenko font that is true to his hand would be tough to pull off. How do you, with today’s reproduction fidelity, stay true to his variation and warmth of his lettering. I think it would look too mechanical or canned.\n\n"
