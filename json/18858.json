Not that it really matters, as both faces are clearly different — just being curious.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Chevin as it looks more sophisticated, with much better balanced characters and a more pronounced character/identity. Also, I have the impression that there’s quite a bit of [ITC Officina Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20060523022425/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?query=officina+sans&pid=204974&page_id=9270&grab_id=0&SCOPE=Fonts) in [Saturday Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20060523022425/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=405975).\n\nHmmm, actually, it’s more than quite a bit, and far too much for my taste. Anybody know who designed this?\n\n"
