  "content": "I enjoy designing graphics on the ipad, but Apple had a strict policy which prevented installing one's own fonts. With the iOS 7 upgrade it is now possible to do so, but the process was complicated, necessitating converting your font first into a data string and writing a bit of code to create the fontname.mobilecionfig installation file.\n\nSome apps like inkpad (the great vecor drawing app) have their in-built method of installing your font through Dropbox. But for regular iOS apps like Pages, do the following:\n\n1- Download the \"iOS Font Maker\" freeware to your Windows, Mac or Linux(?) desktop from [http://thehelpful.com/iosfonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415235746/http:/thehelpful.com/iosfonts/ \"http://thehelpful.com/iosfonts/\") (It is not to be confused with the \"iFont Maker\" on the iTunes App Store which is a mini-Fontlab of sorts).\n\n2- Install iOS Font Maker and follow the instructions to create your fontname.mobilecionfig file. Email the file to yourself.\n\n3. In the iOS 7 ipad or iphone etc. mail app, click on attached fontname.mobilecionfig file to download and install it with one click . To uninstall go to Settings / General / Profiles to see your new fonts listed.\n\nIt works very well all thanks to its designer Keith. Using inkpad or Pages on the ipad to see your fonts during development is a great way to check their outline at all sizes, details and behaviour on Apple devices. Install-uninstall new versions as many times as needed.\n\n",
