[Magistral Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414192607/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/magistral/?refby=bowfin) gets close on all but the A and P. [FF Clan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414192607/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-clan-ot/?refby=bowfin) was pretty good for those two letters, but not the C and L.\n\nMost likely custom, I think. Does anyone know if the ® signifies the design of the logo (lettering), or just the name? I guess I have assumed it meant the design (implying custom lettering).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
