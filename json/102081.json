  "content": "A friend of mine asked if I knew of any Hebrew fonts in an Art Nouveau style. I didn't know of any digital type, but I thought something could be found in the work of Boris Schatz's original Betzalel School, or perhaps something could be engineered from the work of Arthur Szyk. But I also thought that a few of you who enjoy this forum might share your knowledge of art nouveau Hebrew type and whether any digital fonts were ever made.\n\nAharon\n\n",
