I merely wanted to know if this was a free font for people to use, if it is something that has to be purchased, or if anyone knew of a similar font available.\n\nGuess I won't be coming to any of these forums anymore...I thought this was a friendly place...didn't know I'd be attacked for a simple question; you could have worded your response without being so rude. Sorry I'm not font-smart like you but maybe that's a good thing because it seems to do something to one's ability to react kindly.\n\n"

Once I realised the tremendous amount of effort that it takes to perfect a single letter, I started buying fonts. To date, I've spent about $500 on MyFonts.com alone. Including ITC Giovanni. I see where you're coming from, but it's a great distance from anyone on this board.\n\n"

It’s rather your question that easily could be perceived as disrespectful here, though.\n\nYou might wanna check out Typophile’s FAQ: [Where can I get free fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426000821/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FAQ%20Free)  \nCheers,  \nF\n\n"

I’m sorry about that.  \nI might have get carried away, due to the amount of posts asking for quality fonts for free.\n\nFor the record (and just in case Janet isn’t gone):  \nITC Giovanni is a typeface designed by Robert Slimbach, a type designer with a lot of reputation. I actually like it very much. Years of experience and a lot of work are necessary to produce a typeface like ITC Giovanni. That’s why it has its price.\n\n"
