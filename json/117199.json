I looked at Big Top Acrobat, Comedy, Dreamland, Showcard Gothic, Laff Riot NF, Startling and a couple of other Fun Fonts, but they are different. Any ideas?  \nDon\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Ikaho2SM.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701053927/http:/typophile.com/files/Ikaho2SM.jpg) | 34.37 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks Akira & Dick. In the absence of any other comments I will put this alphabet in the original design category and credit Masayuki Sata and Mami Kobatyashi. Now for my probably presumptuous comment of the day: This font seems completely unknown outside Japan and will continue to be so as long as its sales are limited to purchasers of a book where most of the fonts are for Japanese use. If the designers want to make some sales to rest of the world they should consider releasing a the Latin letters version of IkahoAL as a stand alone font sold through one or more of the big resellers. In my opinion the design is very competitive with the other big top fun fonts mentioned in my ID request and could be a solid seller.  \nDon\n\n"

Despite my willingness to pay and try as I might, I could never find any way to pay Western money for these fonts.\n\nA decade later nothing seems to have changed. In this day and age that seems crazy. Do you know why this is, Akira? Why does Japan seem to be isolated from international sales of fonts?\n\n"

Even more extreme than the problems with the Solo fonts bundled with the Dover alphabet books.  \nBTW many thanks for the Punition link. Unique design, Germanic blackletter as if it were reinterpreted by an Arabic calligrapher!  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "The reason might be that a lot of Japanese don’t speak English well. But, I’m not sure.\n\nAnyway, I don’t recommend Latin fonts Japanese designers designed. Most of them are low-quality.  \nAkira Kobayashi who is a Monotype Type Director, Kunihiko Okano who graduated from KABK, and Toshi Omagari who graduated from Reading and works for Monotype UK are, of course, brilliant exceptions. They are great designers.  \nAnd some of the younger designers create high-quality Latin typefaces. (Two Japanese are studying at Reading MA Typeface Design now.)\n\nI’d say Morisawa and Fontworks, two largest type foundries in Japan, don’t sell their fonts to overseas people. I don’t know why.  \nSeveral Japanese foundries, e.g. Jiyu Kobo, Iwata, TypeProject and Motoya, sell thier fonts at Fonts.com.\n\n"
