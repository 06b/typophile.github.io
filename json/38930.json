I should’ve said, “Even with freeware be sure to ’Read the EULA’ because you will be surprised how many foundries offering freeware/shareware fonts actually have restrictions applied to them.” Blambot for instance.\n\nQuote: “This font is freeware for independent comic book creation and  \nnon-profit use ONLY. ( This excludes use by “mainstream” publishers,  \n(Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Oni, Image, SLG, Top Cow, Crossgen and their  \nsubsidiaries) without a license fee. Use by a “mainstream” publisher  \n(or it’s employee), and use for commercial non-comic book production  \n(eg. magazine ads, merchandise lables etc.) incurs a license fee  \nbe paid to the designer, Nate Piekos. “\n\n"
