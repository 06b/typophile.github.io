My old copy is just German, French, and English._\n\nSo is mine, actually (3rd edition, New York: Visual Communication Books, Hastings House, Publishers, Inc., 1977). My translation of _Typographie_/_Typography_ was published by Kniga (Moscow) in 1982. It was just Russian (no German, English, or French), so I had to adapt the text layout accordingly.\n\n"

A contract with Arthur Niggli was signed by Kniga, so we used the original films received from Zürich. Phototypesetting in Univers 55 was done by Pravda on Linotron 202.\n\nAnd yes, there was plenty of space, so, based on the same grid, I used either single-, or double-, or triple-column page layout.\n\n"
