  "content": "Hi! Does anyone know this font? It's called Tanagra, designed by Natale Varetti for a typographical contest in 1910 and later published by Nebbiolo in 1924. It's an interesting font, but I can not find pictures or catalogs: I found only this picture of the italics on the internet. None of you happen to have some more pictures?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416152611im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tanagra%20Italic_5147.jpg)\n\n",
