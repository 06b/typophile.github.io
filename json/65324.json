If people want to help, they will help. Have the decency to stay polite and the patience to wait. However 'urgent' your request may be. Thanks.\n\nAs for the typeface: I couldn't find an exact match, but [Challenge](http://web.archive.org/web/20100323055200/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/challenge-bold/plain/) is very close. There's tons of simular fonts about, also freefonts.\n\ngreetings Jeffrey  \n [infraordinaire](http://web.archive.org/web/20100323055200/http:/www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress)\n\n"
