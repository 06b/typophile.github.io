I’ve deboldened and scaled it to the proportions I want... but I obviously want to maintain the consistency with the regular. Is there any way of taking the outlines from the regular and turning all the characters in that, to masks in the new light? or do I need to go through and do each one manually? I’m shuddering at the thought that python is needed here...\n\ncheers ears\n\n [‹ Bad habit](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108031242/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18531 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Cheap/free font editor ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108031242/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17762 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
