Natalia no longer works there, but I could send you the current art director's contact info (it's not on their website). Or you could just contact Natalia (see Hrant's message above). Let me know what you think.   \n   \nbtw, Natalia posted here once, on a Hispanic Community thread:   \n   \n [http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/5025.html?1056987523](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000111/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/5025.html?1056987523)   \n   \nher message is at the very end. :-)\n\n"
