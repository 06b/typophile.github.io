Here is a [another image](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829113016/http:/media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/11133/11500568_1.jpg?v=8CE7270437D3000%3Cbr%20/%3E), which is still not the best quality. RMN died in 1994 so unless the card was used in his final years perhaps something other than Matrix was used. Digital Matrix was designed by Liko in the mid 1980's as a Mac font. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, business cards were AFAIK printed in other ways. Perhaps another font with the Latin style serifs used in Liko's Matrix?  \nDon\n\n"
