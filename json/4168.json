      "content": "Interesting request. 'Futuristic' and 'digital' seem to be other names for 'techno', which is not my favorite style, so when you said 'not too' in front of those I was intrigued. I would recommend looking in two places: [Psy/Ops](http://web.archive.org/web/20080310230923/http:/www.psyops.com/html/specimens.html), which has Reform, Reykjavik One & Two, Transfer Sans & Default Gothic. The other is [Device Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080310230923/http:/www.veer.com/products/type/det/rs.asp) (Rian Hughes), with September, Gravel, Quagmire, Range & Register.   \n   \nOf course there are many other foundries with techno styles, but these two foundries come to mind as having some of the less stereotypical 'futuristic' looks, in my opinion. T-26, which also carries Device fonts, has one of the most varied Techno collections.\n\n"
