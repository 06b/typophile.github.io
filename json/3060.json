      "content": "Hmmm. Bringhurst says, 'Myriad, like Frutiger, is full of subtle and open geometric forms'. In other words, not humanist.   \n   \nWhen I compare the lower case of Frutiger and Myriad, Myriad is more humanist as Yves says. It is narrower, especially the a, and its round letters more oval, and less circular. It also has more modulation - the tapering of the ends of the c and e, etc. Sort of a humanist version of Frutiger.   \n   \nBut it has the one story g. Maybe other features that lead to Bringhurst's classification? Do any of you have any ideas about this? Why does Bringhurst say 'geometric'?   \n   \nAs to the appropriateness of the face, I think this depends on the goal of the logo. From what you say in the other thread, Lars, and the unfocused look of it, it looks like not enough thought has gone into what a logo for this city should look like.\n\n"

      "content": "Well, the question is not if Myriad fits Oldenburg but rather if at least they could have used small Caps and solid kerning and spacing.   \nAnyway, Myriad is a rather humanis-looking typeface to me too, and so is Frutiger, so... both are good examples of humanist typefaces, much as Akzidenz/Helvetica are of Static and Futura and Beyer is for Geometric. I donï¿½'t see too much geometric stuff here, they clearly stem from a dynamic humane form.   \nOh, and regarding wrong-type-for-a-city... I recently got a brochure of Sulzburg, a small town in Baden... and it was set in ThesisTheMix. Which is a funny typeface, allright... but not for longer texts and not for any kind of very old fashioned and serious town. This is wrong as you CAN get.\n\n"
