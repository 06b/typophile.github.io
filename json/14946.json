Anyone in Boston/New England interested in volunteering and helping plan the conference should get in touch now. It’s fun, relatively painless, and you can have a say in making TC06 the best [TypeCon](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042839/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/TypeCon) ever. We’ll be coming to Beantown in October for planning meetings, but in the meantime, we’re starting on programming, workshops, venues, design, tours, and much more.\n\nTo get involved, post here and/or email me privately at tamye /at/ typesociety.org, and I’ll be in touch.\n\nNon-Bostonians are also very welcome and encouraged to volunteer and help create a wonderful event! We have such an amazing group of volunteers each year - I can’t wait to work with old friends and new faces.\n\n [‹ Two words: original and creative](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042839/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13138 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [printing & type history - 18th century ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042839/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16749 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I didn’t get to see as much as I wanted last time and if I’ll be travelling that far, even if it is close to home (I’ll be in Philly at school), I think I’d rather just see all the exhibits and presentations. Please tell me this is after July 15th (my 21st bday). :D\n\n-Dave\n\n"
