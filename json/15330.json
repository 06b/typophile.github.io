  "content": "Hi,\n\nwhen I look into the font folder of, let say _Palatino_, I find 5 files. One is the “Font Suitcase” and the icon bears the letters FFIL. The 4 other files are “Postscript Type 1” and the icons bear the letters LWFN.  \nMy questions are:\n\nWhat do FFIL and LWFN stand for?\nIs the “Font Suitcase” a bitmap font?\n\nTo rephrase the previous question:\n\nWhat's the FFIL file for and what does it do?\n\nCheers,\n\nSeb\n\n",

LWFN is the file type of a PostScript outline font. FFIL is the file type for a font suitcase. Too bad they decided to use such generic looking icons. What was wrong with a picture of a suitcase?\n\n"

You have to remember, though, that the people who came up with these things were not printing industry people, they were programmers. For nearly a year, the only device commercially available that could output PostScript fonts was Apple's LaserWriter. PostScript fonts were commonly called LaserWriter fonts for a while. When the Linotronic and other devices came out, the usage faded, but even the Linotronic was accessed via the _LaserWriter_ driver for years after, even when the LaserWriter was discontinued. Note also that Apple's icon for a PostScript font was a picture of a LaserWriter printer.\n\n"
