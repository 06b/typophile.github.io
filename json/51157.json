I’m obviously a bit behind here. But I thought websites could only be set in the six or seven system fonts: Arial, Times, Verdana etc.\n\nWould appreciate it if anyone could clear this up.\n\nMarc\n\n [‹ i see these fonts everywhere in NYC](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207232726/http:/typophile.com/node/51228 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [help -need to know ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207232726/http:/typophile.com/node/51220 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
