( [www.zara.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211739/http:/www.zara.com/ \"www.zara.com\"))I thought it to be a form of Clarendon...and maybe even closer with Whitman...but cannot find a similar font anywhere that matches the \"flattened\" R and pin-straight descenders. thanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211739im_/http:/typophile.com/files/zaralogo_03_5490.jpg)\n\n",
