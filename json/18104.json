      "content": "This seems to be a mix of ideas from Art Deco/Moderne styles. The B is like Braggadocio, several letters are like Bust in the Solotype books. It resmbles Glaser's Baby Teeth in some ways. I couldn't find one typeface to match it all, so it's tempting to guess it was 'inspired' by several older styles from that era.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
