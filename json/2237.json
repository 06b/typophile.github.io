I'll see if I can get a scan posted later today. By the way, [Image Club](http://web.archive.org/web/20061114142259/http:/www.imageclub.com/) digitized three variations of Too Much in 1989, but they didn't make the cut when we migrated the library over as part of Adobe in 1994. If you can find an old Image Club LetterPress CD kicking around somewhere, you'll find it on that disc.\n\n"

Are you offering? ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20061114142259im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) So it's birthdate is 1989, or is that only it's digital birth? Don't you think it looks like Milton Glaser's work? I'm going to find a sample of babyfat. I'm going to dig through my U/lc and see if I can't find one. I'm probably entirely wrong.
