Printed and bound in Great Britain by Cox and Wyman Ltd, Reading, Berks.”<cite></cite></cite>\n\ni can’t recall ever seeing weiss before this book, and while i think it is a very nice typeface, it seems almost too beautiful to be used as a text face. i’m not sure exactly what is causing me problems, except the lower case ’z’ which i think is quite nice and always make me stumble as i pause to admire it.\n\ndo any of you know what i’m talking about?\n\nare there better example of where weiss really works?\n\namazon.co.uk have some sample pages [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093546/http:/www.amazon.co.uk/Hidden-Empire-Saga-Seven-Suns/dp/0743430654/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203307627&sr=8-2)\n\ncheers - sye :)\n\n [‹ The future of typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093546/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42112 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Searching for Gerald Giampa ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093546/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42220 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But Stefan Hattenbach’s [Anziano](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093546/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/anziano.asp) was partly inspired by Weiss, and he seems to have appreciated Weiss in a novel according to the blurb on the site:\n\n<cite>In 2004, he purchase a first edition of the Swedish version of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (1959-1961) and was amazed by the excellent flow and presentation of the text on each page. He realized that several major foundries had already done interpretations of Weiss - all of which were more or less true to the original. He didn’t want to add to that list. Instead, Stefan has tried to find his own path with Anziano and hopefully people will think that the design lives on its own.</cite>\n\n"

      "content": "I”ve seen Weiss used a few times as a text font in novels, and it works well if properly set (modest point size, generous leading). Does have a more distinctive character than say a page set in Adobe Garamond, so it’s not for every novel. Only title I can think of off the top of my head is The White Puma, by R.D. Lawrence. Weiss is also slighter wider than the average text font. Overall, then, not one to use if economy of space is an issue. The italic is wonderful in small doses. Drawbacks: no small caps, and roman figures, though smaller than cap height, are lining, not oldstyle.\n\n"
