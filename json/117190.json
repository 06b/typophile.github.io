Then I checked [North Tarrant Express](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051342/http:/www.northtarrantexpress.com/) website hoping for a webfont or a good PDF. No luck. And finally thought somebody would have previously asked for it, checked [MyFonts WhatTheFont Forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051342/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/395825) and found the answer (thanks of Akira1975 as usual I would say).\n\n"
