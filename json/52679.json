On the bottom of an ashtray that lied in the kitchen since the 80's (I remember seeing it there even when I was a little kid) there was a rosetta decoration that resembles quite a lot the BP Helios mark.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414192434im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bpashtray_3999.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414192434im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bplogo_4245.jpg)\n\nI asked my grandmother if she remembered anybody from Landor coming to visit her and showing interest in that ashtray, but she couldn't.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414192434im_/http:/typophile.com/files/generalashtray_5805.jpg)\n  \nThe orange stuff in the back is a delicious pumpkin pie. \n",

That is bizzare-O\n\nI had an ashtray like that so long ago and I clearly remember the old bearded man who gave it to me saying something like 'my son, when you see the light, you will know it'.  \nI have been searching for answers to that statement all my life since getting it. I have tried quitting smoking too and you have now given me what I have so desperately been searching for all these years!\n\nI can now stop smoking and smash that ashtray since it has fulfilled it's purpose... always remember - fill up with BP cos that old man gave me that ashtray and I saw this here... it's so obvious now!\n\n\\*sigh\\*\n\n"
