To coincide with the launch, people buying the whole family (which already represents a saving of $170 over buying the styles separately!) can choose one font (family) from 18 other Schizotypefaces to receive free of charge.\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/gaden-sans/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714161241/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/gaden-sans/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/gaden-sans/\")\n\nCheers  \nDave\n\n",
