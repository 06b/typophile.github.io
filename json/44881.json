  "content": "I’d like to hear some suggestions regarding a general purpose serif typeface for a lawyers office, to be used in all sorts of laser-printed legal papers, letters, and so on. Classic, but not overused. With a distinct, but not obtrusive, character. Small caps and fixed width figures must be available.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n [‹ Font recommendation?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032507/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44790 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Editorial- What does it mean? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032507/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44844 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
