If i want to make an adaptation of an existing typeface, is it legal to open it in Fontlab and edit it and re-save it as my own? I am trying to create something for a design concept I have and don't intend to sell the typeface I create - does that make a difference?\n\n",

Stealing is not really my thing - the typeface is only a small part of the project and I wasn't planning to name the new typeface or distribute it. But if I ever choose to circulate the whole project (which will contain the typeface) I don't want to experience any legal problems.\n\nI would also like to know why it is illegal... Don't type designers ever redraw or trace type in order to make adaptations of it? Didn't Robert Slimbach redraw the work of Garamond? All type can be copied by eye or by tracing, even the spacing between it, right? This issue feels like a question of individual ethics. It seems to be part of an older problem - the difference between 'being influenced' and 'appropriation'.\n\nIf you make something completely different out of something old, does it really matter how you got there?\n\nOr is it about the ease with which the software makes the borrowing possible? So it's not what you steal, it's how quickly you do it that makes it wrong?\n\n"

      "content": "Tara, redrawing/retracing is different from reusing the font data itself. Consider the imperfect analogy of taking your own photograph of El Capitan vs making a photocopy of Ansel Adams'. Mere \"mechanical\" copying typically does not differentiate between the copyrightable and noncopyrightable portions of a work. If there's any copyrightable data in your finished font that owes its origin to the source font, you've constructed a \"derivative work\". Whether constructing a particular derivative work is legal depends on the EULA and whether fair use is applicable (often tricky to determine).\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Novice.  \nWhen Mr Slimbach made Adobe Garamond, I can pretty much guarantee that he didn't open ITC Garamond, Garamond 3, and Stempel Garamond, do some copy'n'pasting and make a few tweaks, and voila! Adobe Garamond! He drew all of the letters from scratch referencing historical models.\n\nWhich is legally okay, since the models in question are no longer protected by copyright. And there are a lot of really talented type \"historical re-enacters\" who make wonderful new forms based on historical models. Mr Carter, Mr Porchez, Mr Hoefler, Mr Feliciano, Ms Licko, and Mr Storm are among the great talents who have made type based on old models.\n\nThat being said... I fully endorse the exploration of existing fonts for new type designers. You can learn a great deal about making type by seeing how the greats make theirs. This is akin to listening to Miles Davis's or Charlie Parker's solos; you can learn a great deal from attentive listening about structure and phrasing. But don't go out and play Miles Davis CD and call it your musicianship, and don't learn those solos by rote and perform them and call them original.\n\nSo. As Nick and Tiffany noted, you should read the EULA to see what the publisher of the font you are wanting to fiddle with says about such fiddling. For many publishers, this kind of fiddling is forbidden, and for some others it is permitted within certain constraints. Please do stick to the terms of the EULA; adherence to the EULA is the only thing we type publishers ask of our clients, and most of us are reasonable small business people, just trying to make a living in a risky profession.\n\nThanks.\n\n"

Keep in mind that this only applies to Open Source fonts, not commercial ones.\n\nIf you want to modify a commercial font, the right thing to do is to contact the original foundry/designer first. Some designers allows modifications to create custom branding fonts, some charge a little extra money to allowing the modifications, some others don't.  \nAlways ask the original designers first.\n\n"
