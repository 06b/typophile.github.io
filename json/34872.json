It can be seen [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20091123164935/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/kursivschrift_virtual/).\n\nDoes anyone know of similar fonts? Same feel.\n\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\n",

I felt that Kursivschrift was a bit too “strong” for the project (which is actually for an all female institution\\* was looking for something feminine). I’ve seen it used in Blueprint, which was what piqued my interest. Thanks very much for the help though:D\n\n"

Modern Danish maps that I’ve seen haven’t used this convention. Does it come from Germany? Does anyone know something of its history? Has it ever been in regular use on English language maps?\n\n"
