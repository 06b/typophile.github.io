      "content": "It depends on different things, like the nature of the text, and the expertise of the translator.   \n   \nAccording to Maxim Zhukov's \"Typographica Polyglotta\", Spanish is about 15% longer then English, assuming a squeaky-clean translation. A very good translator recently made a Spanish version of a 2,500-word essay of mine, and he ended up with an impressive 14%.   \n   \nWhether such percentages are symmetric is a question I haven't figured out yet.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
