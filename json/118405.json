      "content": "I have spent some time looking for this, but couldn't find the exact font. I think this is a commercial font, because it looks like it has ligatures for the 'tu' and 'ti' combinations. Most amateur freebies don't go to that trouble.\n\nUnfortunately, hand-drawn fonts are too numerous to have a good chance of locating the identical one, so I suggest finding anything similar. [Casino Hand](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317201620/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/casino-hand/?refby=bowfin) from MADType is a good realistic OTF font that is fairly similar.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
