I was asked to include the following logo in the title of the site.  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720021926im_/http:/i.imgur.com/3JcQWpJ.png)  \nDo you have any suggestions for a type that could accompany this logo? I'm hoping to achieve sort of a grungy looking site.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  \nThanks in advance.  \n :)\n\n",

      "content": "Hey Katka,\n\nI love those kind of Metal Logos. Looking Good. But why combine this with a grungy font? Let the logo stay in focus.  \nYou could try a more clean looking one. Like Proxima Nova or Franklin Gothic could be a very cool choice instead.\n\nDo you have a typekit account?\n\nIf you really want a grungy font, try fontsquirrel, they have lots of those.\n\n[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/classification/grunge](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720021926/http:/www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/classification/grunge \"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/classification/grunge\")\n\nCopystrukt looks fine.\n\nRegards,  \nFlorian\n\n"
