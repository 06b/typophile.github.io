I have to think that Zaner set would be fun for them to bill to one of their big customers (an eye-opening list, I found out yesterday).\n\n"

And the 10-years of P22 book is the most boundary-pushing type catalog since that po-mo wave (finally) ended. Yet in comparison to that stuff, the P22 book feels genuine and crafted. Much like their typefaces. If you don’t like the catalog that they gave you for free, I suggest that you check out the real McCoy, which I believe is only $19.99 or so, and is worth every penny!\n\n"

But I have done enough things to realize that an arresting image goes a long way to making a great design for some types of things. Some people, including photographers, just have a way with that.
