There's not too many scripts around that it could be?  \n:) j/k\n\nOn another note,  \nwould there be any rational to use a geometric Futura for a romantic/period theme?  \nPerhaps, is it a case of the recent popularity of hairline fonts, or perhaps a hairline font does fit the theme and outweights the coldness of a geometric... since it's such a small weight perhaps the geometric attributes don't come into effect anyways?  \nNah, probably just a favorite type of the designer.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n"
