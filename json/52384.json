There was also a strong attempt to supplant the authority of aristocracy and established churches in social and political life: forces that were viewed as reactionary, oppressive and superstitious.”\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age\\_of\\_Enlightenment](http://web.archive.org/web/20081209045110/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment)\n\nSome ideas:\n\nBaskerville  \nCaslon  \nFleischmann  \nFournier  \nBell\n\n [‹ Typographic Anachronisms](http://web.archive.org/web/20081209045110/http:/typophile.com/node/52386 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Potentially dumb FontLab question ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081209045110/http:/typophile.com/node/52250 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The enlightenment of typography really occurred in the early 19th century, when new commercial media opened the doors to new forms of type.\n\n"
