But I think it’s because I don’t know how to set it properly, yet.\n\nCould someone please be nice enough to point me to some nice example of Sanuk in use ?\n\n [‹ stationery / letterheads books ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907163022/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42835 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Old-style Figures ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907163022/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45506 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
