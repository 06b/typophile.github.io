  "content": "Hello everyone.\n\nI’m starting work on a small annual report for a nonprofit focused on education in North America. For the past few years, I’ve used the fantastic [Locator](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041217/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/index.html) and Locator Display by Process. This year, I’d like to use the Display face again but invest in a nice serifed font for text. It would be great if the new font will belong to a larger family of typefaces, but it’s not necessary. The primary goal is to have a text face that will be friendly and super legible but will also share some of the modern quirks of Locator in a very gentle way. It should not call overt attention to itself and it should be a bit of a workhorse.\n\nI’ve somewhat ruled out Meta Serif but I’m considering [Mendoza](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041217/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_mendoza_roman_complete_vp/) and [Mokka](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041217/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ludwiguebele/mokka/) as these are smartly crafted transitional faces. There’s also [Chronicle](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041217/http:/typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032), which is lovely.\n\nAny suggestions would be welcome! Thanks, in advance.\n\n [‹ Client requesting design file](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041217/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47899 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lipstick typeface or design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041217/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47929 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
