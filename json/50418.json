It is showing a single, raw, cooking ingredient. If the logo really needs a pictorial element you need something that looks more appetising. It doesn’t have to be food itself. It could be some kind of dish food is cooked in or served from.\n\n"

At least here in the US, fast food is \\*not\\* synonymous with healthy food.\n\nThis logo ’feels’ more like an artisan bread shop/cafe, so maybe it’s in the right direction.\n\nAll that said, it’s nearly impossible for us to give you anything but gut reactions on the aesthetics without a lot more details.\n\nMy pure gut reaction: these are hardly the worst logos I’ve ever seen, though perhaps not the best either. But not knowing the budget/process, I can’t really say if they were a good solution for your needs or not.\n\n"

It’s not like a typical fast food with hamburgers and fries...\n\nAnyway , I’m so grateful to u guys for sharing your ideas and opinions with me, so I can learn more about international perception of the logo.\n\nThanx all\n\nAnastasia\n\n"

(To be able to convey good-quality food, available fast-food style.)\n\nMaybe they could have experimented more with the concept of “fast” in combination with “quality” in the type design. It is an interesting combo, since the two concepts don’t inherently go together...\n\nAny update on a new design? I’m curious to see the final logo.\n\n"

The original info we had to run with was “fast food.” It doesn’t say fast right now, which seems to be the key message.\n\nAlthough healthy has been added to the mix too now.\n\n—————  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Graphic Design Melbourne](http://web.archive.org/web/20081016094840/http:/www.solid-creative.com/identity.htm)\n\n"
