  "content": "When I type (copy/paste) same text in CorelDraw (x4), Illustrator (CS4) and MS Word (2007) in font I created in FontLab, every program shows me different kerning.\n\n- Illustrator shows everything alright... kerning and leading, it's like in FL.  \n- CorelDraw shows unlogical kerning... space between glyphs are more wider then in FL or Illustrator. Some glyphs are overlapping too...  \n- Word shows no text, just glyph for \".notdef\" for every letter typed!\n\nI've read [this topic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106223958/http:/typophile.com/node/15458), and I've tried to add autohinting to font just to see will it make any difference, but everything remained the same.\n\nAny suggestion/solution?\n\n",
