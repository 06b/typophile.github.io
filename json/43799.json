  "content": "I am working on a project about the typeface Garamond. It's history, different, versions, and uses today. I was wondering if any one has good examples of products, companies, or anything else that used any version of Garamond both contemporary and all the way back through history to its orgin with Claude Garamond/Jean Jannon. Specific examples of Adobe Garamond in use today would be really helpful as well.\n\nAlso any good books/sites people know about for information about Claude Garamond or any versions of Garamond would be awesome. Thanks for the help.\n\n",

The information I have now is a pretty complete biography for Garamond himself, a few examples of his work, characteristics of the typeface, and some other various information about the face.\n\nOne thing that I am specifically looking for now is relatively high quality images (just higher than on screen) of work that used Garamond's typefaces back in the 16th-18th century when his typefaces were really popular in Europe. Modern examples (like Apple or Abercombie's use of Garamond) are also needed.\n\nReally I will take any information you have and then I can go through it and just ignore any information that I happen to already have\n\n"

I know this because the people behind that awful identity did a book about their identity programs, and made a big point out of switching OSHA from ITC Garamond to Sabon. It’s sort of good for a laugh, I guess.\n\n"
