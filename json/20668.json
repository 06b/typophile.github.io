Designer Colin Brignall created a strong baseline effect like that of an old automobile manufacturer logo so the lowercase letters would touch or slightly overlap in word settings. The TrueType versions of Harlow are free with any purchase on ITCFonts.com for the month of June.\n\n[http://msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2476&et=T&s=47007&da=0](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811132910/http:/msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2476&et=T&s=47007&da=0 \"http://msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2476&et=T&s=47007&da=0\")\n\n———————————————\n\n\\<2\\> What’s Hot from ITC: ITC Berkeley Oldstyle Pro\n\nMeet ITC Berkeley Oldstyle Pro, a lovely and practical font family. With this release, one of Frederic Goudy’s favorite designs is finally available in OpenType format. Now graphic communicators can work with this beautiful design while taking advantage of OpenType’s capabilities, including the automatic insertion of old style figures, ligatures and small caps.The new ITC Berkeley Oldstyle Pro fonts offer an extended character set supporting most Central European and many Eastern European languages, in addition to English.\n\n[http://msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2467&et=T&s=47007&da=0](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811132910/http:/msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2467&et=T&s=47007&da=0 \"http://msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2467&et=T&s=47007&da=0\")\n\n———————————————\n\n\\<3\\> Font of the Month: ITC CuppaJoe - Save 10%\n\nNick Curtis’s inspiration for ITC CuppaJoe comes from Art Deco lettering, but not from the typical sources. Its foundation is the label art for Bokar, A&P’s premium coffee during the 1930s. Curtis built on the gently sweeping curves and bold angular strokes of the original coffee-can lettering to create a distinctive typeface that commands attention. And, at 10% off, this rich, full-bodied typeface is as satisfying as a CuppaJoe!\n\n[http://msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2477&et=T&s=47007&da=0](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811132910/http:/msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2477&et=T&s=47007&da=0 \"http://msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2477&et=T&s=47007&da=0\")\n\n———————————————\n\n\\<4\\> fy(t)i: Thinking Small\n\nLike Alice in Wonderland, type can be made to grow big or small depending on our whim. In Part II of a two-part article on font sizing, Ilene Strizver discusses when - and when not - to set display fonts at small sizes.\n\n[http://msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2470&et=T&s=47007&da=0](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811132910/http:/msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2470&et=T&s=47007&da=0 \"http://msg1svc.net/servlet/Gateway?p=AGFAITC&u=2470&et=T&s=47007&da=0\")\n\n———————————————\n\n\\<5\\> Big Savings on the Family Fun Value Pack\n\nFire up the grill and start sending those barbeque invitations! Summer is nearly here, and to celebrate we are offering the Family Fun ValuePack at 10% off. This entertaining package includes ITC Jambalaya, Lambada, ITC Kristen, Pump Regular, ITC Ziggy and ITC TotSpots.
