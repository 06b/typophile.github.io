But the sans is mundane, and the \"stubby serif\" cut isn't working at all it seems... :-( I think interpolating serifs _can_ work (look at Penumbra), but it might be easier with flaring (as opposed to stubby) serifs.   \n   \nI love the angled serif cuts in the \"full serif\" version! It seems that they're helping avoid that dreaded \"backslant syndrome\" that fully upright half-serif designs have - nothing short of a small breakthrough on your part. And the caps are really singing. It's like a butch Avance.   \n   \n(More soon...)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
