Does anyone recognize this face? Or if anyone could suggest something similar, that would be helpful as well.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202183916im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Thailand-Tattler_4961.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Duvel neon sign - (similar to) Linotype Auferstehung {Yves}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202183916/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36548 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Hatteras Yachts logo square oblique sans ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202183916/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36568 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

However, the caps are too heavy and the n and h are too wide and the leg gets heavy out of the join too soon (needs more thick-thin contrast like the other letters). I know its not up for critique but its got so many nice things going for it (c e f s g) that I hate to see those unfortunate oddities.  \nJust my 2¢\n\nCurious on the ID as well.\n\n"
