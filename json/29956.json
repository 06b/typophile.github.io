The following image shows it with no kerning above, and tightened to balance out the spacing below.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106080752im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mythkerning_3625.png)\n\nIf I open the rest up enough to match YT with even a tiny space the entire word breaks apart. Pulling stuff together yielded the monstrosity above. Suggestions?\n\n",

Only slightly moreso between the MY than the YT. the corners on the top of the Y should nearly touch the tops of the M and T.\n\nHow's this?:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106080752im_/http:/typophile.com/files/myth_kern_4367.jpg)\n\nIf you're displaying this much smaller, the overall space should open up.\n\n"
