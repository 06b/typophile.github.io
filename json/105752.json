  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've been working on my first typeface for the past 2 and a half weeks.\n\nThe idea was to create a type inspired by the Bauhaus letterforms but adapted to modern times.\n\nWith styles good for **Display** (\"regular\" and \"bold\") and others good for **Text** (\"book\" and \"book bold\").\n\nI haven't set the kerning yet and there's still plenty of work to do, but I wanted your opinion about what I've got so far.\n\nTHANKS!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [beta\\_12\\_sample.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020104/http:/typophile.com/files/beta_12_sample.jpg) | 187.99 KB |\n| [sample\\_1\\_regular.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020104/http:/typophile.com/files/sample_1_regular.jpg) | 119.31 KB |\n| [sample\\_2\\_bold.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020104/http:/typophile.com/files/sample_2_bold.jpg) | 129.88 KB |\n| [sample\\_3\\_book.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020104/http:/typophile.com/files/sample_3_book.jpg) | 114.16 KB |\n| [sample\\_4\\_book\\_bold.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020104/http:/typophile.com/files/sample_4_book_bold.jpg) | 130.98 KB |\n| [promo\\_bauhaus.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020104/http:/typophile.com/files/promo_bauhaus.jpg) | 121.76 KB |\n| [promo\\_graphic\\_design.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020104/http:/typophile.com/files/promo_graphic_design.jpg) | 80.04 KB |\n| [promo\\_sleep.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414020104/http:/typophile.com/files/promo_sleep.jpg) | 967.36 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "i like it. there is something that catches my eye, and that’s the pointy corner inside the bold /s. I suppose you could make that a bit more round. Also the lowercase /a has some kind of weird buckle, where the upper curve joins the stem. And you might put the tittle of the /i just a hint higher, so it has either the exact same distance to the stem before, or fits the cap height.\n\nThe phrase about sleep is really catchy. May be you should adjust the kerning a bit though. Combinations like /p to /t and /t to /o look a bit big.\n\nbest regards\n\n"
