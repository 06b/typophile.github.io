Members of a typeface superfamily differ not only in [weight](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/typophile.com/wiki/weight), [width](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/typophile.com/wiki/width), [inclination](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/typophile.com/wiki/inclination), [optical size](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/typophile.com/wiki/optical%20size) and [character sets](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/typophile.com/wiki/character%20set), but also in other design characteristics such as stroke modulation and treatment of serifs — but still share certain other characteristics such as proportions, which allows them to work together. ITC Stone Sans, ITC Stone Serif, ITC Stone Informal and ITC Stone Humanist are four families that form a superfamily.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Multi-font Families?](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/typophile.com/node/21412)  \n [Family that Contains Both Serif and Sans Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/typophile.com/node/28187)  \n [Poll: The best term for a type family that includes both serif and sans serif fonts is?](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/typophile.com/node/29942)  \n [How Related are Members of Type Families?](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628052734/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35727)  \n [Type Terminology: Sytems?
