I didn't know it would be that simple, I thought I had photocopied from some rare esoteric manuscript!\n\nHmm....\n\nActually the bottom right ornament with the hanging double leaf is not in the Minion characterset so I wonder of the origin before adopted by Minion.\n\nYou don't get off that easy!\n\n"
