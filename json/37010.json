  "content": "Is there a special name for a Manuscript containing a collection of Calligraphic styles? I thought I had maybe heard of one before but I may be mistaken. Are you aware of any examples in Libraries? If you were going to try to find such a book what search models would you use keeping in mind a card catalog rather than an online keyword model? The best I can think of right now is to look under 'Calligraphy'. If you have a more precise idea please let me know. Thanks!\n\n",
