We recognise the ‘eureka!’  \nmoment when it strikes and opens up new creative possibilities in our  \nthinking and work. These can be the most pleasurable and effective  \nmoments in our design careers.\n\nCome and hear how other graphic designers have approached the problem,  \nand learn about the challenges that their careers have brought them, at  \nthis year’s conference.\n\nSpeakers include Paul Antonio, Joel Armstrong, Antonije Baturan, Sara De  \nBondt, Susanna Edwards, William Hall, George Hardie, Rian Hughes, Robin  \nKinross, Emily Luce, Karel Martens, Tyler Moorehead, Lizzie Ridout, Erik  \nSpiekermann, Jeremy Tankard and Jake Tilson.\n\nBook tickets online  \n [http://stbridelibrary.eventwax.com/seeking-inspiration](http://web.archive.org/web/20080327001447/http:/stbridelibrary.eventwax.com/seeking-inspiration \"http://stbridelibrary.eventwax.com/seeking-inspiration\")\n\nEarly bird tickets cost £100 and are available until 15 April.  \nThe regular price is £150. Concessionary rates are available for paid-up  \nFriends of St Bride Library, students and those over 60.\n\nMore information, including programme details when they become  \navailable, is at  \n [http://stbride.org/event/seekinginspiration](http://web.archive.org/web/20080327001447/http:/stbride.org/event/seekinginspiration \"http://stbride.org/event/seekinginspiration\")\n\nYou can also contact St Bride Foundation on +44 (0) 20 7353 3331 or  \nemail KanakChhatralia [at] stbridefoundation [dot] org\n\n",
