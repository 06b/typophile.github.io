  "content": "Hi,\n\nI urgently need an illustrator / type designer to create some type in the EXACT Daft Punk 'Get Lucky' / 'Random Access Memories' type style for a reasonable fee.\n\nThis look heavily references the type also from Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' record cover.\n\nPlease only respond if you are 100% confident that you can get this quickly, exactly right.\n\nIt's two words that we need to be illustrated, in this exact style.\n\nSuggestions of good illustrator / type designers who could quickly do this welcome, also.\n\nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311183502im_/http:/typophile.com/files/daft-punk-get-lucky-remix_6412.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311183502im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Daft-Punk-Random-Access-Memories%20copy_4801.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311183502im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RR0910_024_lg_3816.jpeg)\n\n",
