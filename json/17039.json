If I recall correctly, we modified Franklin Gothic for the identity card type, and were able to get quite close without too much difficulty. Even if it wasn't completely accurate, it also wasn't recognisable as a specific later typeface. Fun work, and something that could become a lucrative and interesting field for many of our colleagues if the studios start paying attention to Mr Simonson. :)\n\n"

(depending on the film's set or art director) go a more logical route first seeking what their own studio or CBS Studios might still have available in terms of sign props? (Free standing extruded, cast or cut letters.)\n\nMy younger son works in L.A. at an antique store that specializes in architectural hardware from European gothic cathedral door hinges, to brass spitoons from the 1920s. He says many of the set and prop workers in Hollywood hunt for period style fixtures, door knobs, ceiling fans, etc., then bring them back to the prop dept. workshop to make knock-offs for the various sets.\n\nMy point being that the responsibility for making/finding letters for \"CBS NEWS\" might have gone to through the \"property master\" to the prop dept instead of through the art director to the art dept.\n\nInstead of creating all the letters from scratch, the prop people might have gone the research route and found only a few existing sign letters, mistakenly identified what they had as Helvetica, thus constructed any missing characters as Helvetica???\n\nBesides, we know that both [signage manufacturers](http://web.archive.org/web/20120127004627/http:/www.scottsigns.com/ExtLtrs.htm) and sign makers deal in a different scale than graphics people. If type designers prior to phototypesetting frequently modified character design for scaling of titling weights, wouldn't even skilled sign crafters consider subtle modifications for characters ranging from 12 inches to 20 feet tall?

It was fun to see them back to back because the new one follows the original store very closely and includes many references to it. The titles on the new version--the ones with Bodega Sans--were similar to the original, but could have been better. In fact, in all the extras on the DVD of the original, they did a really good job of aping (ha!) the original titles, even creating a font to match the lettering. The titles in the new Kong look \"inspired by\" while the DVD's look astonishingly like the real thing, down to scratches and frame jitters.\n\nThe \"one other thing\" I noticed that's mentioned at the end of the article was Bodega Sans used for dimensional letters above a marquee on a theater. It's a fleeting image and I missed it the second time I saw it. It may well have been my imagination. There was one more thing (which Scott Stowell mentioned on Design Observer and I had forgotten about): During the opening scenes depicting the Great Depression, there is a down-on-his-luck guy sitting in front of a box labeled in large letters set in Optima. Aside from those few things, I thought they did a great job on signs and such. I noticed there were three sign painters listed in the credits. Nice.\n\n"
