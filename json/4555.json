Many of the characters follow blackletter form, but not strictly.   \n   \nIt also works suprisingly well at smaller sizes, and can be used for short blocks of text.   \n   \nIt was (very) loosely inspired by Frere-Jones' \"Pilsner\", but quickly developed its own direction.   \n   \nThe character set is not yet complete, but this sample gives a good feel for where it's going.   \n   \nAs always, critique is most welcome.   \n   \nDavid Thometz\n\n",

      "content": "The caps are great. I'm with Stephen on the J,j and Y,y. I have a hard time with the g too. It needs a more open bottom bowl and an ear consistent with it's other angles. Also, I'd pull the numbers way back; they are kind of bumpy. The text has a very strong vertical emphasis that is lost on the numerals. Almost every letter has one very bold vertical stroke going from top to bottom, giving it a very boxy feel. (just like the original textura quadrada). I think you could give the numbers this same feel. For ex. the 2 could have a longer vertical stroke on it's back, the five could loose the angle on it's back, the seven could have a strong, vertical leg attached by a hairline consistent with other angles in the face and the 1 and 4 could loose their base serifs.   \n   \nI know that you have avoided horizontals exepting on the bases of vertical strokes, but I think one would be appropriate on the crossbar of the 4.   \n   \nWow. I hope that's not too much. I really do like the feel of the face. The E and the R are about the coolest things I've seen in a while. I'm interested to see the rest of the character set (how do you do it? your faces are always to complete).   \n   \nChristian R.\n\n"
