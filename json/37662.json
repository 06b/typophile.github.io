I’m sorry, but I don’t believe I’ve ever seen that font before.\n\nFor future reference, John, it’s the MyFonts automated WTF utility that has a max of 25 characters. For the MyFonts Forum, as here, more is generally better for identification purposes.\n\n"

The only font with a similar ’y’ is Chas HW (which is otherwise not a match).\n\nBased on the source, this is most likely a custom job for Barneys. You could try contacting someone at [Ingredient](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111001451/http:/www.theingredient.com/) as they seem to have designed the site.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
