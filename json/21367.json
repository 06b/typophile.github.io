Anything that demonstrates its versatility for both text and display, would be especially useful.\n\nHuge thanks in advance\n\nEd\n\n [‹ Bringhurst vs. Tracy vs. The rest of the world](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007161237/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21133 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Litho Antique and Venus ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007161237/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21365 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Kodak is still in the process of rolling out their new branding and logo, so I don’t have many examples of that that I can show. The new logo has been discussed before I believe. Needless to say, it is not one of my favorites. But, that is neither here nor there.\n\nIf you look here:\n\n[http://usa.visa.com/personal/visa\\_brings\\_you/advertising/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007161237/http:/usa.visa.com/personal/visa_brings_you/advertising/index.html \"http://usa.visa.com/personal/visa\\_brings\\_you/advertising/index.html\")\n\nyou can see all of VISA’s new ads, all using Whitney.\n\n-shu\n\n"
