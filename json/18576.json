I don’t see how a tablet would be beneficial. That’s just my opinion though.\n\nIf you’re talking about brainstorming phase, ideas, sketching etc. then I suppose you’d be better off getting your concepts out with a tablet.\n\n"

Everyone works differently, but for me, whether it is drawing with vector tools or pixel pushing, my hand can move much more freely across the canvas, and with more accuracy. I find that it is more comfortable than using a mouse, however, strangely enough, I have developed a callous on my pinky finger (aka Wacom Callous™) from the way I hold the pen. :) Don’t let this scare you — I haven’t yet come across anyone else with this problem.\n\n"
