Apart from being good-looking, the place is packed with great information about type and typography.\n\nThe downside—-it tends to attract quite a few jerks who love arguing on the internet. They love showing hubris to each other and engaging in pissing matches. I’m breaking ranks here to say this, and I don’t mind at all. :^) it pleases me to tell the truth.\n\nTypophile, sure. Gripe-o-phile much of the time.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "_So James, is the site about you liking others? =)_\n\nFriendship and the assumption of good faith on the part of other members is a major part of Typophile for me. I make an effort to like others and to be polite to them. A number have a tendency to assume bad faith however, and show an unmistakable arrogance or elitism. The assumption of bad faith is what I meant by “jerks”—-knee-jerk reaction to things said. It happens all the time and has the effect of derailing discussions and causing some very silly arguments, needless topic drift, and bad vibes.\n\nIdeally Typophile should not be about me or any of its members liking each other. That should be automatic and taken for granted. It is supposed to be a civil place devoted to typographic collaboration. But that is a simplistic and vague definition. Some very fragile egos are involved here, and the fact is many accomplished typographers and type designers gave up up on Typophile long ago because of the snottiness of its denizens.\n\nThis is of course hard to prove.\n\nThe reception given to you Chris, for example, has been only luke warm so far. Only two people made the effort to welcome you. That’s pretty slack, and apathetic to say the least. I made sure to give you the good news first, and the caution about Gripe-o-phile was made in good faith. I didn’t say it to put you off, but to be realistic, as it would have been unfair to paint only the bright side of the picture. I doubt many other typophile members would have been as honest.\n\n_This might get a bit off topic, but if you have a good book to recommend, let me know!_\n\n\\* The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst  \n\\* The History and Technique of Lettering by Alexander Nesbitt\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

With a topic of “Hi there”, how are some people going to know that they should respond in a certain way? Added to the fact that the number of new threads bumped it to the second page?\n\nMost Typophiles are good, hardworking folks who care about what they do, almost to a fault. They need to see things in a certain way, particularly the full-time type designers, because they need to have a conviction that what they are doing is worth it.\n\nAnd the count is now 3 :)\n\nWelcome Chris! If you’re a photographer, feel free to share if you have a portfolio online, or if you find anything at all remotely related to type. Share and share alike.\n\n"
