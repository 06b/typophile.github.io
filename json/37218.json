  "content": "Hi,  \nI’m looking for the name of an old chunky typeface.  \nMy investigation leaded me to Zubilo Black from ParaType (sample here: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/zubilo-black/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140707110156/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/zubilo-black/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/zubilo-black/\")), which is the same exactly font I’m looking for.  \nThe reason for I’m posting here is that I’m quite sure an older font than the one digitalized by ParaType exists, but I can’t find its name (maybe it has never been digitalized before).  \nAnyone has a clue?  \nThank you all,  \nbye\n\n",

The bouncy, irregular, blocky shape style is not really a new thing, if you go back to [Artistik](http://web.archive.org/web/20140707110156/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/artistik/), and Harquil (which has been digitized as \"Harlequin\", and is shown in Solotype and Petzendorfer books, and very similar to [Gaiety Girl](http://web.archive.org/web/20140707110156/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/gaiety-girl/)), which are both Art Nouveau era (over 110 years old). There are others, including [Softie](http://web.archive.org/web/20140707110156/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/tailspinstudio/softie/), that MyFonts Uses all over its site.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The caps only from ComixHeavy [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140707110156/http:/www.abstractfonts.com/font/62?text=AaBbCcDdEeFfGg) do match the caps in Zubilo. Pat Snyder's [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20140707110156/http:/www.patsnyderartist.com/patsnyder_fonts.html) has a showing of Comics Cartoon II too. The lowercase from Zubilo may be original, don't really know about that.\n\n"
