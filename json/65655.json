  "content": "I was given the responsibility of designing the programme for my church choir's Christmas concert at the last minute, and threw one together in a single evening. So it's very basic, and I was very limited in my type choices, but I thought typophiles would appreciate a seasonally-appropriate example of multiscript typography (it's a Korean church in France). Sorry about the picture quality.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012224454im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cantate1_5243.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012224454im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cantate2_4679.jpg)\n\nThe Korean typefaces used were Munchebu Jemok Batangche (문체부 제목 바탕체; \"Ministry of Culture titling serif\") for the display and Nanum Myeongjo (나눔명조) for the text. The Latin uses Arno.\n\n",
