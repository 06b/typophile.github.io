I tried to reach you via LinkedIn, but I guess you don’t have that redirecting right. Please use hpapazian\\_at\\_gmail\\_dot\\_com, and thanks profusely for the help.\n\nRestricting embedding: no matter how negatively I feel about that in general, there’s no force majeur here that would excuse ignoring that clause in the H&FJ EULA\\*, which is why I mentioned convert-to-outlines as an option. Now, restricting the embedding of glyphs converted to outlines? Don’t give me an emigraine.\n\n\\* Very nice to hear about distinctions between embedding intents BTW.\n\nhhp\n\n"
