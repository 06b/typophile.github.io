  "content": "I want to get some feedback on a logo I’ve been working on. It’s near it’s final stages. The company name is RxLocal—they are a medical marketing company.\n\nI’m working on R & x together, along with incorporating a “graph” feel, to show the marketing sign. I think the combination of the Rx, and a “graph like” image will be enough to visually explain the company.\n\nThe Rx is a heavily modified News Gothic, which I’m still working on (part of the reason I want some feedback). Right now I have a few versions. I have a boxed version, the clients request. I also have a “L” shape version, which I came up with. I think it adds another element from a graph (X,Y plane) and also works as an “L” for local when the “LOCAL” text is dropped below the mark.\n\nThey wanted a green organic color, but I’m not totally set on the colors yet. I’m not sure if I like the Rx together or separated yet either. Let me know what you guys think so far.\n\n[http://www.rosem.com/work/rxLocal/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122120130/http:/www.rosem.com/work/rxLocal/ \"http://www.rosem.com/work/rxLocal/\")\n\nThanks,  \nMike\n\n [‹ Lost & Found Stock (stock-photo collection)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122120130/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48617 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Mexicoooo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122120130/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48821 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "My thoughts:\n\n-The top part of the “R” doesn’t sit well on its two legs. The top is too big and the legs are too skinny/awkwardly placed.\n\n-I don’t care for the distorted looking arrow coming out of the top of the “x”. I never like it very much when things look distorted when they don’t have reason to be.\n\n-I do like the colors . . . reminds me of the european style pharmacy signs.\n\n-I’d like there to be perhaps more interaction between the “R” and the “x”. Right now they’re pretty static. I’m not sure if what you said about placing the “R” and “x” together meant making the “x” an extension of the “R’s” right leg, but perhaps you should experiment with that placement - typical when referring to pharmacies and prescription drugs.\n\n-I like the simplicity you’ve got going here and I think you’re on the right track. Hope some of my thoughts help you out.\n\npenn\n\n"

I was wondering why not design the logo to be more reflective of the traditional Rx (as described by pennANDink) are you consciously avoiding that?\n\n"

      "content": "I disagree with one of the points that pennANDink is making which is the angle of the arrow on the x. The distortion of the arrow works well with the angle and creates perspective.  \nIn my opinion, the logo that is working best is the lowest logo before the 4 horizontal ones because the X and Y lines get the idea of the graph across more.\n\n"

The position that the rx sits in within the L shape feels unbalanced, almost floating away. The LOCAL tag looks like an afterthought, the letter spacing is horrible and the size is disproportionate.\n\nBut if you say its finished thats your call i guess.\n\n"
