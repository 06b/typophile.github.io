Mason and chemistry graduate student Carlos J. Hernandez produced particles that are just microns wide and shaped like each letter of the alphabet. Graduate student James Wilking used “laser tweezers” to pick up the letters ’U, C, L, A’ and move them in order.”\n\nBe sure to click “Next” for the second image too.\n\n [‹ IKern vs Adobe InDesign&#39;s optical kerning](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202182121/http:/www.typophile.com/node/10317 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font Categorization in Character Palette ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202182121/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33852 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
