I finally dug it out of the myriad files and folders on my desktop and decided to put it up on here for critique.\n\nSome notes as I'm looking at this with a fresh (and more learned) perspective:  \n1. I'd like to go through and redo some of the weights of certain strokes (the hairline stroke atop the 'a', the bowls on 'a' and 'd')  \n2. I think the character widths need some refining.  \n3. I'd like to put different tails on the 'a' and 'd' that more closely resemble the serifs on the 'd' and 'l' ascenders.  \n4. The serifs to the left of the 'i' and 'l' are indeed longer than those on the right (to mirror the serifs at the top of the ascenders)  \n5. I'd like the dot atop the 'i' to be heavier.  \n6. I'm pretty fond of the 'm,' though I think it is a bit wide compared to the rest of the characters.\n\nAt any rate, critique away!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416115207im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DalaiLama_4081.PNG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416115207im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DalaiLama_MinA_6282.PNG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416115207im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DalaiLama_MinM_6022.PNG)\n\n",
