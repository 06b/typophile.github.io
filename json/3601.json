  "content": "Hello, I�m Mar�a from Uruguay, and I write because I have a problem and I think that you can help me. My teacher recommended me this forum. I�m in first year of Graphic Design and I have to make a project about the new sans typographies I know, and I want to use this:   \n  \nCorpid, Spiegel, Parisien, Meta, Default Gohtic, Info, Albert   \n   \nI chose them because they are my favorites, but I know that they are under licensee, and I cant pay for them. I want use them for an academic exercise, not for a commercial way, and I think that maybe you can send me them.   \nIf you think that exist some typography whose isn�t in the list and it can contribute to the project, I be grateful that you send me too.   \nThanks a lot for your help, and sorry for my English, because is very basic.   \nKisses   \nMar�a\n\n",

Corpid, Spiegel and Parisine are more than 5 years old. They aren't so 'new'.\n\n"
