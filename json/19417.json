Actually my professor asked it. “If you maximize the x-height, ascenders and descenders of a particular glyph, does that mean the glyph gets larger in measurement?”\n\nMaximize=increase the length vertically.\n\nMy thinking is no because the width and the stroke contrast remains the same.\n\nAny ideas guys?\n\n [‹ sans serif complement to Chaparral?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808131302/http:/typophile.com/node/19326 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [this looks like a cool book, if you like Fraktur ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808131302/http:/typophile.com/node/19426 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I am confused. Also, if you are talking about optimizing the use of the whole EM for small point sizes to make them read better, you maximize the x-height att he expense of the ascenders and descenders.\n\n"

(And added the “maximize” elaboration.)  \nWhat did your prof ask, exactly?\n\nAnyway, now it can potentially make sense, and the answer would be “no”,  \nbecause the font has to fit within its size-less bounds\\*, and making all three  \nparts bigger in an instance makes nothing bigger in the abstract.\n\n\\* Except if it’s a swoopy, dainty script face. But still.\n\nhhp\n\n"
