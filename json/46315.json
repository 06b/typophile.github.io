  "content": "Hi. I'm new here, and working on a music festival poster. Really need to find the font named \"SuperCooper\" from the 1960's/1970's. It's a bottom-weighted, heavy version of Cooper Black in the classic early Seventies ITC/U&lc style. May also be known as Super Cooper, SooperCooper, Sooper Cooper, etc. My old typographer had it in their Linotype catalog, but they're long gone.  \nWould love to know if there's an online source for downloading SuperCooper this week; I've a deadline approaching. Cheap, shareware or freeware would be cool. Thanks for helping out, if you can.  \nRandy\n\n",
