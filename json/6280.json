Their current 'logo' currently consists of typing AQUAtreat just like that, they cant see whats wrong with that but as I always use the logo as the basis for the site I would like to present them with some alternatives. Any critism is more welcome than you will ever know!   \nThanks.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052803im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47169.gif)\n\n",

I like \"Smart Water\" they have a pure feeling in their logotype and packaging. Also think about the utility aspect. A good water company should have a very trustable versitile logo. As it stands now your logo can be trusted on the surface but lacks backbone and longevity.\n\n"
