Each font file has some OpenType features: discretionary ligatures, fractions, subscript and superscript. The Force family is suitable for big-size high impact situations like posters, headlines, titles, magazines, packaging and many others you may creatively think of.\n\nAvailable at **[MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015025348/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/force/)**,: $29,90 per font & 1 free font.\n\nI hope you like it.\n\n",
