This forum and quality members is always a blessing.\n\nBecause I am lucky enough to live in Paris, I will go ask my poster tomorrow at the Lazy Dog (if there is some left) where Parra had an exibition last year. The Lazy Dog is very well known for dragging the all (graphic designers and arty sick people of ) paris — like me — so I usally try to avoid this place. Well, tonight I changed my mind !\n\nHere is a link for a bigger image :  \n [http://www.thelazydog.fr/images/products/219\\_large.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017140502/http:/www.thelazydog.fr/images/products/219_large.jpg \"http://www.thelazydog.fr/images/products/219\\_large.jpg\")\n\nThank you a again.\n\n"
