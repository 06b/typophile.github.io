  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have been trying to identify the black font on this invitation for the last 2 hours, using various apps and font identification sites, but with no luck. I figured I should ask some experts! The most unique letters are definitely the lower case \"s\" and \"g\", which extend below the other letters and overlap when next to each other.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help anyone can give me.\n\nThank you!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSCN6566-1-1024x767_5820.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Riesling \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [kthomps5](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182913/http:/typophile.com/user/175823 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
