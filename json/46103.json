  "content": "I recently started designing a typeface that I am really excited about. This is where it started:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820025631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/simplify_5694.gif)\n\nWhile it looks like a script, its really more of a sans serif. I don’t want cursive or italic forms (like s, one storey a, f and so on), rather I want a relaxed sans typeface that is interconnected. I know this will take some serious work, but I am up for it.\n\nPlease give feedback and let me know your thoughts.\n\nThanks!\n\nEvan MacDonald  \n [evanmade.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820025631/http:/evanmade.com/)\n\n",
