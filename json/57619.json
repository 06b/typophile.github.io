  "content": "Born in London in 1929, Mike has degrees in architecture and graphic design from Yale. In 1958-59 he was lucky enough to be the person who put in order the punches, matrices and molds at the [Plantin Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20131114115816/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Plantin%20Moretus%20Museum). Jackson Burke at [Mergenthaler Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131114115816/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mergenthaler%20Linotype) believed that this experience might be turned to account preparing type libraries for photocomposition machines. Inheriting the design staff originally trained by [Chauncey Griffith](http://web.archive.org/web/20131114115816/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Chauncey%20H.%20Griffith), Mike managed the expansion of the Linotype library from a collection of 150 American hot metal designs for text-setting to an inclusive library of nearly 1,500 international digital designs for full page setting. In 1981 he left Linotype with [Matthew Carter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131114115816/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Matthew%20Carter) to found [Bitstream](http://web.archive.org/web/20131114115816/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bitstream), went on to found The Company in 1987, and Pages Software in 1990. Pages developed a word processor on the NeXT platform which provided the writer with powerful graphic support.\n\nCourtesy of The Font Bureau, Inc.\n\n",
