I did not take it in that direction when I created it for the client, but think it would be worth doing if it is to be included in my portfolio as a case study. The thin streaks sound like the best solution to me.   \nOK, I am going to park that for a few days and try it out when I have less deadline approaching. Thanks for the good idea. Hrant.\n\n"
