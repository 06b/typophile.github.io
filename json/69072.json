  "content": "Hi there this is my first post-  \nRookie designer looking for some critique/ feedback on these logos.\n\nThis is a re-brand for an established IT help desk company  \nwhich is looking to promote the web hosting side of their business.\n\nThey're present branding includes the red colour, with just text (arial i think)  \nI'd unfotrunately like to stick with only the fonts you get free on a standard mac.\n\nI would like to present a maximum of 3 logos to the client,  \nnot got the confidence yet to decide for myself whats best.\n\nAny feedback welcome, just your top 1 or 2 logos  \nsome finish work needed on all logos\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019025249im_/http:/typophile.com/files/samples_5721.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Definitely not B. Too much detail.\n\nNot A, C or E either, because they depict WiFi service or product.\n\nThat leaves D, which is not bad purely from the perspective of the mark design. But I cannot relate the mark to neither help desk nor to the web hosting service. So I agree with gtrianta - D shows most promise, but it needs work.\n\nAlso consider using two colors for edesk. One for e, and the other - for desk.\n\nAlso d-e and s-k look too loose compared to e-d and e-s. I would re-kern for consistency.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks gtriana - i'll investigate the calligraphic style, not sure if I have a font for the type that will match it, or if it relates to th business\n\napankrat - thanks also, i'd agree with you that the e and desk need differentiated, and that E and C depict wi-fi,  \nthe idea with A is that the 3 lines depict a stack of hard disks (the web hosting) and also and uppercase E,  \nwhich i guess is redundant really.\n\nthanks aluminium, always good to hear a positive with the constructive, I guess I need to work on the d mark and see what  \ni come up with.\n\nif anyone has any ideas on a mark that depicts web hosting (not forgetting the ITdesk angle) i would be glad of the advice\n\nGood Stuff!\n\n"

      "content": "I am a bit color blind (green and brown colors are sometimes a problem). So don’t give too much on my comment with regard to the colors: The contrast of color and light is odd in all examples. The colors somehow don’t work together (in both columns, except from the white logos). And partly the examples look mixed up from existing logos/icons.\n\nAnd I dislike the shine on the symbol in A and D. In A and E the color of the three curves does not harmony with the rest of the icon/sign.\n\nThe best is this ed-ligature. But even there is a disharmony between the ligature and the text below.\n\n"
