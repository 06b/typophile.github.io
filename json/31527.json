This is most similar to the \"Angel License\" popular in the growing scrapbooking market. Here's one example, the first typical one I googled: [http://www.digitalscrapbookpages.com/digitals/index.php?main\\_page=produc...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015010807/http:/www.digitalscrapbookpages.com/digitals/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=66&products_id=3626 \"http://www.digitalscrapbookpages.com/digitals/index.php?main\\_page=product\\_info&cPath=66&products\\_id=3626\")\n\n"

I want to keep it in common terms as much as possible, but the first post is copied and pasted from my semi-coded notes in excel. The actual full length text will replace this with specific examples, much like the design license linked above describes. When exclamachine.com goes back online, I will have a license comparison table, but I will probably describe the Commercial Use there as \"Limited\" with a footnote or similar.\n\n"

Does this jive with the consumer expectations? There was a thread on this, but search has failed me.\n\n"
