A better view of g would be useful  \nSo here are some possibilities.Triumph is a British product in business since 1903. Perhaps a British font in 1966?  \nThe letter forms available in 1966 suggest that this could perhaps be a sloped and edited variation of Coronation, Stevenson Blake c. 1937. [designer?]. But the M is not right.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019065102im_/http:/typophile.com/files/coronation@20_5634.jpg)\n  \nSomewhat similar were Corvinius, designed by Imre Reiner for Bauer 1929-34 which had lighter serif features on T and E.  \nAlso somewhat similar is Eden, designed by R.H.Middleton in 1934.  \nAs for the g Coronation or Corvinius might match, but not Eden  \nI did not come across any digital versions of any of these fonts as an italic.  \nDon \n"
