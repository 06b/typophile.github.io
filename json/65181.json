The content I’m working with requires both be able to handle small caps. Not a problem for Caslon Pro, but I was working with Franklin Gothic up until I realised it doesn’t have small caps, well not the version I have anyway.\n\nWould anyone care to recommend some to me? I’d be very grateful if you could.\n\nThanks very much.\n\nJono\n\n",

I was aware that Carol Twombly designed Caslon Pro, but I’m not being that strict about it to be honest. It’s a bit like us Brits still calling Jaguar a British car, when the company is owned by an Indian firm! Does anyone else have any suggestions?\n\nThanks again.\n\nJono\n\n"

      "content": "If any version of Caslon qualifies as English, then surely American grotesques must also, as the grotesque style originated in England.\n\nWhat style of sans originated in the US?  \nHow about the “humanized geometric”? e.g. Dwiggins’ Metro or Bernhard Gothic? (Admittedly Bernhard/Kahn was German, but the face was published in the US while he was living and working there.)  \nOr perhaps “low-waisted art deco”, seen now in Neutraface.  \nAlso consider ITC Highlander, by Brit Dave Farey, but closely based on the lettering of Oz Cooper.\n\n"

Thanks very much for your suggestions, but I’m not sure the humanised geometrics you suggested are right for my project, which has a strong political/international law base to the content. As much as I love a low-waisted art deco face, I think they wouldn’t suit my content. Thanks though!\n\nSomething like Benton or Alright would be quite nice as my content is focusing on the political climate of the past ten years as a result of the war on terror, and those sans are quite recent. I might well end up choosing a European sans if it gives me the flexibility I need, but the project is for an ISTD brief and I really want to have informed choices and not just pick a font because I like it.\n\n"
