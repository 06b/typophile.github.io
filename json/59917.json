There was no continuity from day to day, just a different pun about the characters depicted.\n\nA couple that I recall:\n\nThere are two capital letters, and the one on the right (a **G** , I believe) has a subscript **2** next to it. The letter on the left says, “Hey, George. Who’s the cute little number?”\n\nA lower-case **e** is speaking to an **ê** with a circumflex, wearing it like a hat. The **e** says to **ê** , “I like it. It’s got a certain _je ne sais quois_.”\n\nAm I imagining this, or does anyone else remember this cartoon? I would love to find examples of it.\n\n",
