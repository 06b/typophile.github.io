And it’s looking like a damned long, time consuming process.\n\nSo I am just throwing this font out there…  \n [http://www.woodardworks.com/type13.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208141024/http:/www.woodardworks.com/type13.html \"http://www.woodardworks.com/type13.html\")  \nI’ll post new versions as I process whatever advice and critique you typophiles might generously provide.\n\nLaconic is my attempt at the basics. A super simple physical design in three weights with as many OT features as I could deal with. They all work on my system (mac) but I’m sure they still need a lot of work to conform to proper cross platform OT code.\n\nI started playing with the physical design of Laconic while reading some of the bitmap pixel font threads. After a while I backed off the idea of making an actual pixel font (way too confining) and designed a font that only LOOKED like it conformed to a really tight grid. I tried to keep curves and diagonals down to a bare minimum and still be legible.\n\nI know it’s dry but I think it has a little bit of charm and it’s a great place to start with the whole OT features programming thing.\n\n [‹ GDI printing from Adobe Software on OS X](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208141024/http:/typophile.com/node/37496 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [kern subtable overflow ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208141024/http:/typophile.com/node/37295 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Robby,  \nPretty cool. It is not as exciting as some of your other faces, but it works. The capital C stood out to me, I think the hook at the top terminal is a little out of place, or clunky. Also the 3 and 8 feel a little awkward. When I was working on numerals, I tried like, 3 variations of each, to try to fit them with the rest of the alphabet.\n\nI hear you about the OT programming. I’m a beginner with type design, but I love it. I’m still in school, so it’s hard to devote that kind of time on a side project.\n\nYour website is pretty flashy; pun intended. I like the animated logos, it adds character to them. I was thinking, it looks like you are a Flash master, so it shouldn’t be too hard for you to learn OpenType features.  \nBest wishes,  \nTerrance\n\n"

      "content": "Re: OpenType... Be mindful of your feature order, and keep it consistent among the weights. Putting fractions at the end of the chain means that activating any other feature that substitutes figures will override the fractions. If that’s not desired, you could simply move ’frac’ further up in the ranks. Another option would be to include the tabular and oldstyle figures within the fraction substitutions.\n\n"

I didn’t realize the order was critical. Also I put the frac feature above sups and sinf in all three.\n\nThanks for the feedback!\n\n"
