And this ogonek is put on wrong place in Helvetica regular system font (Leopard OSX today). See attachment\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013050543im_/http:/typophile.com/files/u_ogonek_5133.jpg)\n\nPlease anybody: if You know person in Apple or related, push him to correct this thing.\n\nWe learned to put ogonek on the right at school:) And our grands do so:)\n\nThanks,\n\nŽydrūnas.\n\n [‹ Death By Bodoni](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013050543/http:/typophile.com/node/50332 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Helvetica Rounded please ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013050543/http:/typophile.com/node/50320 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Bold and Bold Oblique are in line with your ‘good’ sample, aren’t they?  \nThe version that came with Tiger (OSX 10.4, v.5.0d8e2) looked different; with the ogonek at the right position, albeit detached.  \nPretty inconsistent.\n\n"
