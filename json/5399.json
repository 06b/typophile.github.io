  "content": "Anyone have any recommendations on what software/file format combination works best, when developing type specimens for the web? Will one get better results from Photoshop CS compared with Photoshop 5.5 or 7? More specifically, does Photoshop / ImageReady CS do a better job of compression than the older versions? I'm assuming that it does. PNG or GIF?   \n   \nI want nice, smooth, lovely, type specimens, that load quickly.

Loved that PDF he put together.   \nNow that you mention it, I would love to use Illustrator for producing type specs for the web. I love working with type in Illustrator. Are you referring to Illustrator CS here? Can you crop stuff when you export?   \n   \nAnd David, thanks for the compliment on my 'jy'. It's the result of blood, sweat, frustration, good professors, cramped hands, etc... from college. i'm always surprised people see the 'y' actually.\n\n"

I might have to use that line.   \n   \nJon, seriously go with Illustrator. If you are using CS, you will have a bit more typographical control than previous versions of AI (like a fancy glyph window and OpenType features), however it certainly isn't necessary to export very nice type specs.   \n   \nZara\n\n"

I'm not sure why. I think maybe it's because I don't like their packaging. a dumb reason, i know. it's sort of the same way with me for sports teams. the nicer their uniform, the more i like the team. like, the pittsburgh steelers, for instance. greatest team on the planet. and they just recently started using futura (at least i'm pretty sure it's futura) for the numbers on their uniforms. that was a good day in pittsburgh, when that happened. no one else seemed to care though.   \n   \nthanks for the illustrator hints. just what i needed.\n\n"
