Both previous suggestions are close, and I want to add [Century Schoolbook](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205073146/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monotype-century-schoolbook/?refby=bowfin) as another that I think is close.\n\nApparently there are untold versions of Century/Scotch Roman faces that were created in metal type, and what we can do is suggest similar digitized fonts, but the choices are relatively narrow compared to what probably existed in metal type.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Thing is, based on the layout style, the subject matter (a guide to exotic fruits), the oxidization colour of the paper and the presence of a section in Univers at the far right, I'd say this is from the mid-eighties at the very earliest, probably a decade later. Don't think any Swedish newspapers were still using hot-metal processes at that point, let alone letterpress, and most had already switched over to digital.\n\n"
