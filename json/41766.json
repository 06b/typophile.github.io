It could be great for lettering artists, or designers who can letter but have limited time budgets and can’t take the time to clean up their own work for publication.\n\nBut it’s still irrelevant to the 50%+ of designers who don’t work on Windows.\n\n"

      "content": "The main problem seems to me that once you have made the step from calligraphic drawing to contours you cannot go back.\n\nThis means that you either have to develop the whole typeface with the calligraphy tool, which would be difficult if you cannot actually typeset (does Live Pen export fonts?).  \nOr, you would make the step to contours at some point but then you loose the advantage of making calligraphic adjustments unless you go back again, convert again and so on.\n\nIdeally, you should have a tool that controls stroke weight and transitions according to a calligraphic logic but is implemented on the basis of outlines in the first place (and in FL, of course). That would allow you to work in both 'modes' at the same time.\n\n"

Also, there is no setting that controls the transition between thin and thick, it is always linear.\n\nIn that sense, it is far inferior to Kalliculator. None of the Noordzijan logic implemented.\n\nOf course, you can do all this by making up the letter with lots of individually adjusted nodes but then that is not quicker than drawing the contours straight away.\n\nAs I said, that was just a quick test, maybe I missed something.\n\n"

They were really little. Sorties when exporting to fontlab not found.\n\nThe only point - although the absence of any tutorial.\n\n"

To my great regret, in Moscow did not have feather to the left, and searches yhe Internet for video lessons left ended in failure. I had thought that perhaps no one I encounted this problem and this must be change. Than I decided to loyal.\n\nI am very sorry that I have dissapointed you, but forgot to write that it was me.

They are nice to fool around with, but it still does seem when the proper work needs to be done I still need my points and handles.\n\nFrom my experience, using the real world tool, and analyzing the results provides something applications can't emulate...yet. Or is it that most of us are proper fussy sorts who get off on plotting the most efficient curve (MEC) for our glyphs?\n\n"

So something really brilliant like LivePen comes out as a Windows-only Illustrator plugin. But at least FontLab was able to buy it, and hopefully it will turn up in a future version of FontLab sometime around 2025.\n\n"
