  "content": "I am trying to trace the history of the use of the term \"humanist sans serif.\" It seems pretty indisputable that Gill Sans is the first of this kind, but I have found that, though from early on Gill Sans is promoted as a sans of a different kind to the contemporary geometric sans-serifs from Germany, \"humanist\" doesn't seem to have been the word used to name this \"different kind.\"\n\nA companion question (which actually may go pretty far in helping to answer the first) is when was \"humanist\" first used to describe specifically ANY lettering (that is, seriffed types or script)? B. L. Ullman in 1960 still opines that humanistic script has been deplorably neglected in scholarship, but cites Morison's writings of the early 1940s as the \"leading treatment.\" Was \"humanist\" used in any of the turn-of-the-twentieth-century books? (I have Theodore Low De Vinne's 1900 Practice of Typography here and I don't see the term used.)\n\nSo: what's the earliest you've seen \"humanist\" used to refer to a sans-serif type?\n\nAnd what's the earliest you've seen \"humanist\" used to refer to any lettering?\n\nThanks for any help you can provide!\n\n",

Granted, this is writing/lettering and not type, per se.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Johnston (Gill's teacher) were using the term in <cite>Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering,</cite> first published in 1906, though I'm sure that's not the first use of the term.\n\nD.B. Updike refers to the Humanist book hands in an early chapter of his seminal <cite>Printing Types</cite> (first published in 1922). But he doesn't use the term to refer directly to types. When discussing the influence of the Humanists on the first Italian types, he uses the term \"Humanistic influence.\"\n\n-- K.\n\n"

They both say the Lanston Monotype version was done 1929-1930.\n\nBringhurst says that Goudy Sans is the \"spiritual father\" of \"several recent typefaces, including Erik Spiekermann's Meta and Officina.\" Perhaps Erik will chime in and let us know if Goudy sans was indeed an influence or inspiration.\n\nGoudy Sans has never been very popular, but I have a feeling that subsequent designers of humanist faces have been aware of it. I my guess is that it was path-breaking, though is not entirely successful as a design.\n\n"

Even in the mid '80s, when I designed Shinn Sans, I thought of it as a calligraphic face, not humanist, and could only really add Eras and Shannon to the genre, and possibly Frutiger.\n\n"
