But perhaps Sony didn't want to have Japanese bringing up the rear. Or else they realize that cellphone/blackberry technology is, to most intents and purposes, pretty similar in functionality with this generation of e-paper, until e-paper actually becomes bendable and constrained only at the spine.\n\n"

      "content": "Digital ink works by flipping little cells that are black on one side and white on the other. The flipping is done by applying a momentary current to each cell. Maybe they can apply a partial current and get the cell to flip 1/3 and 2/3-rds of the way, getting two shades of gray? That would mean they can also apply smaller increments and get more shades. Hey, maybe they can even _orient_ the cells and get them to fill corners! :-) I can see a new bitmap font format, where pixels have DIRECTION. :-\\>   \n   \nBy \"halftoning\" I guess you mean the effective dpi for 4 shades goes down to 85? That would suck, and might be false advertising too.   \n   \nBendability: I think the paper itself is, but maybe they decided to make this product not? Maybe they think people will need to get used to the idea, and/or they're leaving room for improvement - a common tactic these days especially.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

You could even make ruleset that pixel would have to re-orient under certain conditions for certain purposes redefining the anti-aliasing according to context and use.\n\n"

Although it's possible they've ignored the probable relevance of the type-fidelity difference typical of reflective-versus-emissive displays.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
