  "content": "Hi all,\n\nLong time, no typophile! It's good to be back.\n\nAnyways, here's a photo of some lettering on a plaque -- I believe the date is around 1904, certainly no later than 1910. I'm hoping to find a font that's somewhat similar so that I don't have to spend a bunch of time tracing letters on a crappy photograph. The ones suggested by TypeNavigator and IdentiFont aren't really fitting the bill:\n\nAlinea Incise -- to variable in letter weight, and the O isn't perfectly round  \nLinotype Aroma™ Regular -- The M is missing that lovely point, and the O isn't perfectly round  \nAvant Garde Demi -- has the right O, but not much else\n\nThe closest one I found is Futura medium or demi -- I could probably work with these and modify the width of some of the letters, as well as change around the E. However, I do love those gently opened Us.\n\nAnyways, if anyone has any other ideas, I'd love to hear them!\n\nThanks,  \nBeth\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [usoleum-lettering.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018033511/http:/typophile.com/files/usoleum-lettering.png) | 156.02 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hey Beth. If you only need to do \"MAUSOLEUM\" I think Futura is probably a sufficient basis. Even the \"S\" seems to match in terms of slight wobbliness.\n\nOr wait, what about this:  \n [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/superla/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018033511/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/superla/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/superla/\")  \nReleased just 19 days ago! (Although apparently the original is from the GDR days.)\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "[Superla](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018033511/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/superla/) from Primetype looks quite similar in shape, except that the crotch of the M is not pointed. It's unfortunate that your sample shows so few helpful letters from an ID point of view. For example, C, G, J and R would be a big help, in addition to the M and S in your sample.\n\nI have to agree that Futura Demi seems a very good match for the letters you have shown.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Obviously I've plucked this from Mausoleum. :) I think modifying Futura will work just fine, and if I decide to use the above image in the header, I think Futura would work well for other title text on the site.\n\nThank you!\n\n"
