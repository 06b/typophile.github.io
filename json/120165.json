Photos are from letter head and ashtray. The font is normally not degraded but it's a magnified photo on linen paper.\n\nIt's similar to Marlowe Cocktail and Yasashii but certainly neither of those. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

Not certain as to the technique for the ashtray.  \nI agree with your call of Yasashii as a similar that could be adapted.  \nYou might also look at Ultra Modern [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/ultra-modern-rr/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008024944/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/ultra-modern-rr/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/ultra-modern-rr/\") for ideas as to how to do additional letters if you want to extend the alphabet.  \nDon\n\n"
