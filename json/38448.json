      "content": "I had a brief e-mail conversation with Tal Leming a couple months ago about just this sort of thing. Even though the OT spec recommends that {frac} be applied only on an as-needed basis to a limited string, I felt that there were plenty of occasions where it would be more desirable to be able to apply it globally and then manually turn off only the few exceptions. James's cookbook scenario is just the sort of thing I had in mind. Tal's trial solution was similar to the one Nick put forward.\n\nIn addition, the thing I brought up to Tal (and something which is implied by Nick's 5 1/3 example) is that editors will naturally input a space to separate integers and their related fractions, whereas in typesetting, you generally don't want an intervening space. Deleting those spaces manually is a tedious layout task. To eliminate the need for manual adjustment, Tal devised a substitution that replaced a space that follows a figure and precedes a numerator with a special \"fraction space\".\n\nI'd have to go back and find the e-mails to recall the exact code. This was just a theoretical exercise, since I didn't have a specific font or client in mind -- only a common situation that I'd run into many times that I thought might be solvable. I haven't had occasion to fully test Tal's sample code or implement it.\n\nBut the \"fraction space\" issue is actually separate from the \"global fractions\" issue and I think worth considering as an inclusion in a more conventional {frac} implementation, so that a designer could include the leading space when applying the {frac} feature in the standard manner, thereby eliminating the space in typeset presentation, but leaving it in the underlying text encoding, so that if the material gets repurposed into another format (one without proper fractions) the intervening space remains to indicate the difference between eg. 1 5/16 and 15/16.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

Suppose you have a document set in a font which automatically removes the space-between, and switch to one that doesn't -- the typographer/editor/proofreader will have to be really on the ball to catch the few instances in text, in say a cookbook, where the space jumps back in.\n\nTherefore I would say this technique should only be used in proprietary fonts, not retail fonts.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nAnother treatment of the space-between has been mentioned by CharlesE in this forum -- I recall he reworks fonts to add kerning between integers and numerators, and that's something I'm starting to put in fonts.\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, you could either substitute the space between numeral and numerator, maybe even taking into account a fraction following the numerator(s) -- which however blows up the feature code for just a little effect.  \nOr, you could solve this by positioning and reduce the space's advance width. The contextual rule would have to be the same as the one used for substitution.\n\nRegardless of the implementation, this may be considered a border case. Is this still kerning, i.e. a spacing correction, to be applied by default? Or does it belong to what I call \"typographic spacing\" which also includes adding space before colon, semicolon, exclamation and question mark, etc? This then would be optional and be covered in a different feature than \"kern\".\n\n"

I imagine we do a lot of things differently from some users; we strip most all coding out of the typescript (MS), and we recode or put in a lot of InDesign tags with EditPad Pro -- including the code for fractions. The reason is that most manuscripts coming in via Word are a jumble of general styles and direct formatting; best to get rid of it & start over.\n\nWe also don't concern ourselves about anyone trying to recover text from a PDF; instead, the assumption is that any \"repurposing\" will be done via exported & reworked XML files.\n\nMore to the point, it is hard for the type designer to know just how the font will be used; to cover all bases, a lot of features would have to be written. One of my pet grumbles -- how can a type designer know just how the font will be used? Traditionally, it is the users of type who make these decisions.\n\n"

      "content": "In InDesign we ran into this issue fairly early because the first OpenType fonts at Adobe with 'frac' just had a simple ligature-like substitution for the basic fractions which could be applied globally. Later, after it was decided to switch to a more generic implementation in the fonts there was a fear that some documents would be set with 'frac' applied this way (like a cookbook). We talked about trying to be more intelligent about applying 'frac' selectively under the hood, but decided we didn't want to start second-guessing when & where to apply OpenType features. Fortunately, back then we had a much smaller user base. Similar issues existed with the 'ordn' feature, at least in earlier font implementations.\n\n"
