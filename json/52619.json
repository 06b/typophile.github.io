  "content": "I’m using ITC New Baskerville at 11 points for the body of a bible-related study guide. I want this guide to have a fresh, clean, professional look. Originally I was torn between Mercury and ITC New Baskerville, and eventually opted for the latter when I saw it effectively used in a book.\n\nNow I need a good sans-serif font to be used for headers to compliment this work.\n\nI’ve been working in Word and was originally using Arial Black at 20 points. But lately I’m totally turned off by the Microsoft licensed fonts.\n\nA professional logo was recently created for this work, and the designer used Neue Helvetica 73 Bold Extended in all caps for the logo. So originally I investigated that font using both lower and upper case letters. The headers in my book will use mixed case.\n\nThe width of Neue Helvetica 73 Bold Extended is nice. But the white space in some lower case letters (like a, e, and s) is unsatisfactory. I read the thread regarding Helvetica and Univers, and it seems the latter is favored by designers ( [http://typophile.com/node/33301](http://web.archive.org/web/20090806054323/http:/typophile.com/node/33301 \"http://typophile.com/node/33301\")). After comparing Univers 73 Black Extended with the former I agree that Univers is superior to Helvetica.\n\nAll that being said, I’m not married to any header font at this point. The extended fonts seem to contrast nicely with ITC New Baskerville.\n\nThe qualities I’m looking for are:  \n1. High contrast  \n2. Readability  \n3. Clean professional appearance\n\nPlease recommend some fonts that you think would compliment ITC New Baskerville. Thanks.\n\n",
