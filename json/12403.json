I like the look of the new Aspirin Advance font from T26 or Byrant from Process :)\n\nI’ve tried every way I can to get in contact with Ben to licence Kravitz, but to no avail.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAaron.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [kravitz\\_thermal.gif](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=kravitz_thermal.gif) | 20.79 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks so much for your detailed response :-)\n\nSome excellent suggestions there, and if I’d caught this not 30 minutes ago I probably would have went with either Century Gothic or UniF, but I ended up going with Byrant, which I’m happy with, the only thing I failed to notice was that it wasn’t unicase [I’m going to assume Unicase is where fonts mix up upper and lower case in one case, ala Kravitz].  \nI thought I would be able to sucessfully modify the lettering in Photoshop to get the mix of cases I wanted.. I think I will have to fiddle alittle more :)\n\nThanks again for your help, very much appreciated!\n\nRegards, Aaron.\n\n"
