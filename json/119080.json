  "content": "I recently needed to recreate some lettering on some 1970s electronic studio equipment, but could not for love or money identify the typeface used in the equipment name/logo. I've since recreated the letters I needed, about 20 in all, but I'd still like to know if one of you might identify it for me.  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422055051im_/http:/typophile.com/files/flange_0.png)  \nIf this has never been digitized I might be interested in finishing what I have already started and putting it out there as a revival font. See what you think.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [flange.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422055051/http:/typophile.com/files/flange_0.png) | 5.64 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks, Dick.\n\nThe page at abfonts you linked to says the following: \"Cutin\" is Cut-in Medium on page 163 of The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces. Apparently \"Cut-In\" was released by Letraset in at least Medium and Bold weights. So at least now I have a name–but no information on a designer.\n\nThe font called \"Simplement\" that you linked seems to be a pretty nicely done digitization of the Medium weight, updated with additional characters and most common diacritics, though there are no kerning pairs. I wonder why this one has slipped though the cracks in terms of digitization and release. I'm not going to go searching for a complete source of now, but this might be one to keep on the backburner for later consideration. Might be nice to see a good rendition of the family. Perhaps Old Nick will give it a go.\n\n"
