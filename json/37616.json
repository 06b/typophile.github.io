Hosted by The Herb Lubalin Center of Design and Typography at The Cooper Union (October 11-27), the traveling exhibition features the work of 51 artists and designers and their inventive ways of interpreting the alphabet, ranging from graceful and polished to witty and subversive. The 63 alphabets featured in Alphabet were created by artists in North America, Europe and Asia, representing works from well-known typographers such as Ed Fella and Ken Barber to rising artists such as Sweden’s Hjärta Smärta and Andrew Jeffrey Wright of Philadelphia’s Space 1026.\n\nOctober 11-27, 2007. Weekdays 11 a.m.- 7 p.m., Saturday, 12 p.m.-5 p.m., closed on Sundays.\n\n [‹ Font ID: Narrow Script on old Graphis cover](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121222804/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37621 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Articles and postings from ATypI ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121222804/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37285 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
