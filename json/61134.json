      "content": "Hi Etah!\n\nThe basic idea is kind of fun and leisure. However I would use some better typeface for \"I do\" and the backside of the card.  \nThe info text (and symbols) in the bottom will scare clients away. Just make it as simple as possible. That would make a good contrast to the fun approach on the front. Had a brief look at your site and I think also that putting a title like \"Artist/Graphic designer\" would make a true impression. Well just my personal thoughts. Good luck!\n\nCheers\n\n"

      "content": "Etah, looks better now. A few things though. Why choose lower case \"e\" and \"c\" in your name? Also I would lower the name  \na bit and put you web address at the bottom with the same typeface as the rest of the contact info. Maybe rise that whole  \ntext a tiny bit from the edge. Changing the \"hotmail-address\" would also give more respect from clients.\n\nWlll, a bit of humour/irony can't hurt?! I often see graphic design as a \"good wrapper\". For example, if ha book has a terrible content, the client still would like to have a good looking cover. Now either you accept that and make a good cover or you say \"no thanks\". You (hopefully) have the choice of say no if, it doesn't fit your ideal, moral etc.Also, as a designer you will not be blamed for the content, product etc. You will be judged by your design. right?\n\nWhen I worked with advertising, I could very well be judged in a broader sense because I was sometimes involved in the design, strategy, statements etc. And of course in some cases things can't just look good. Getting involved in a logo design means (for me at least) it has to look great, be logical, practical, economic and be able to work in a wide range of environment.\n\nCheers  \n/Stefan H\n\n"

I'm still a beginner, so I didn't feel I could say something greater than that.\n\nI was just trying to put my personality into this card instead of making it serious looking. so maybe that's why it's quirky and cocky looking.\n\nThanks a lot for your help guys.\n\nI changed the E and C into upper case, but is there really a difference? I just liked the lower cases better for some reason. And I didn't know there was something wrong with hotmail. But I guess I'll have to get a new email then. haha.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422211402im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cardback_5028.jpg)\n\n"

Maybe you can try finding a better hand?\n\nI see way too maybe typefaces, especially for a business card.
