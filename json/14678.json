  "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nWelcome to the first Typophile **Critique Thursday**!\n\nBetween the hours of 1pm – 3pm E.S.T., I'd like to invite all typophile to critique the following typefaces on our critique forums. Here are direct links:\n\n**Bitmap Display/Script**  \n [Trixie](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/7694)\n\n**Bitmap Text**  \n [Minque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/8034)\n\n**Blackletter/Uncial**  \n [Adam](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/5416)\n\n**Display**  \n [Sëftos Parathenia](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/14471)\n\n**Display**  \n [Sëftos Parathenia](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/14471)\n\n**Motion/3d/Experimental**  \n [KUB](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/5331)\n\n**Sans**  \n [Parker Sans (Still Untitled…)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/14419)\n\n**Script/Handwriting/Graffiti**  \n [AS Letters](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/9315)\n\n**Serif**  \n [Notanutha Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/10479)\n\nMy moderator access does not allow me to change the names of older threads. So while I didn't change the names of all the threads to read something like **Critique Thursday: Featured Serif Design** , I think that everything will be OK anyway.\n\nMy appologies to designers who sent me suggestions that I did not use. It certainly does not mean that I don't like your work! I tried, wherever possible, to avoid typefaces that already had a lot of discussion (like Raph's, for instance).\n\nSo, let's get on to the critique, and see what discussion comes out…\n\nFor discussion on the idea \"Critique Thursday\" itself, please visit this thread: [http://typophile.com/node/14608](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415051916/http:/typophile.com/node/14608 \"http://typophile.com/node/14608\")\n\n",
