It was used quite a lot in the Netherlands, and even a bit in the UK and France, not to mention Switzlerland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This ridiculous idea that fraktur is a uniquely German phenominom is a 20th century construction.\n\nNoordzej evn points out that Fraktur itself is a French, or rather Burgundian invention, contrary to what German historians tend to believe.\n\nBut Joannah is right, I think. I’m assuing that fraktur—or any blackletter—wouldn’t be a fit for 19th century Russia.\n\nWhen a traditional or modern serif isn’t what you are looking for, what about a fat sans serif? Or a slab or clarendon? I know that there are Cyrillic versions of these now, but I don’t know when they came on the scene. Would it be anachronistic to use a Cyrillic clarendon for a 19th-century purpose?\n\n"

And weren’t you the one who singled out Germany as the country where people wouldn’t touch fraktur with a 10-foot pole? Not that Poles get as tall as Dutchmen. ;-)\n\nhhp\n\n"

For instance, these Cyrillic characters don’t have straight legs, so don’t use a typeface which has similar Latin characters that are straight-legged.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119145942im_/http:/typophile.com/files/russ1.jpg)\n\nAgain, Cyrillic has many characters which have a strong emphasis along the baseline, x-height line, and cap line, so use a Latin typeface that has a similar emphasis.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119145942im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RussN.jpg)\n\n"
