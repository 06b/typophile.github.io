After actually _looking_ at the sign for a minute I realized what it was (sorry for the lazy post on my part).\n\nI think the original designer may simply not have realized you can mix weights in order to have some characters larger/taller than others while maintaining visually consistent strokes, and so stretched the end characters vertically. In replicating the logotype for their new website I’ve used bold small caps for the guts of the word and regular-weight uppercase caps for the end letters. Seems to have [worked fine](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830000242/http:/www.greenboathouse.com/dewinetz/foxgloves_sign.jpg).\n\n"
