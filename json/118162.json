Some alternatives for the moment: [Milano MTT](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051238/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mtt/milano), some [M-B Creative](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051238/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/M-B_Creative), [CityOf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051238/http:/www.railfonts.com/cgi-bin/font_shop/fontshop.cgi?ACTION=enter&thispage=page10.html), [Arquitecta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051238/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/arquitecta), [Leto Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051238/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/glen-jan/leto-sans)\n\n"

If this screen capture comes from Snowpiercer title sequence, here's the [previous discussion](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051238/http:/typophile.com/node/115652) on the topic. Unfortunately, nobody identified it. My best guess [Telegrafico](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051238/http:/www.dafont.com/telegrafico.font) with a custom /S (borrowed elsewhere? Akzidenz-Grotesk?).\n\n"
