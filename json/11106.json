      "content": "In both IE 5.1 and Netscape 4.7x on my Mac the discussion pages are almost always far, far too wide. I have to scroll right to read long lines of text that don't have any line breaks in them, and the limit on just how wide these pages can get seems to be infinite. In this PARTICULAR thread the page works fine - as if the frame it is in has a set pixel limit, but many other threads here don't seem to have any page/column width limit. Surely this can be fixed pretty simply by tweaking the templates.\n\n"

      "content": "Manual line-breaking is indeed a form of art.   \nBut note this: it reaches true nirvana only   \nwhen one adapts the actual content to   \ncreate a pleasant block of text.   \n   \nFurthermore: a good paragraph is neither a   \nroller-coaster ride with huge gaps and juts,   \nnor is it a military tribunal with completely   \nstraight sides; it is a pragmatic, human thing   \nthat is neither frantic nor frigid. The Ancient   \nGreeks knew this; in comparison, the Romans   \nwere juvenile.   \n   \nMy maxim for the ASCII age is this: Write for the rag.   \n   \nBut the reason I refuse to do it on Typophile is simple: the typing window uses the predictable, monospaced Courier, but the end-result uses a proportional font - this makes the creation of nice text blocks much too laborious.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

In truth, I sent only one e-mail regarding the problem, several months ago, and it was a secondary mention within a message about another topic. I didn't bother following up because I was getting along just fine on the boards entering my name and e-mail address manually with each post.   \n   \nIt was only with the creation of this thread that I thought to ask about it again. As you can see, Jared fixed the problem for me immediately, for which I am grateful.   \n   \nMy previous post was somewhat careless, and while Jared made no indication of taking offense, I wanted to clear the air anyway.   \n   \nJared and Joe run a great organization, and I for one really appreciate their efforts.   \n   \nDavid (who once was lost, but now is found) Thometz ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107164759im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
