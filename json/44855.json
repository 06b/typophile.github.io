I have just recently completed my first year within the Graphic Design industry after graduating from Middlesex Uni.\n\nAs we know Graphic Design consists of various elements. One thing I have discovered during my uni days even more so during my post as a junior designer, I absolutely love working with typography. What I would desperately like to find out if there are specialist areas/industries/career paths where I can channel my passion of type, type and MORE type?\n\nI look foward to your advice and input!\n\nDeren\n\n",

To experiment, to be creative, start your own foundry or agency, and see if anyone is willing to pay for your fun.\n\n"
