      "content": "Eric, in FontLab Studio 5, press [Command] + T to open the Actions dialogue window.\n\nUnder “Metrics”, go to “Set sidebearing…”\n\nEnter in 0 for “Left SB” and 0 for “Right SB”  \nCheck the box at the bottom that says “Apply to entire font”.\n\nIn Fontographer, there is a command from the pull-down menus at the top of the screen for deleting all metrics. It is called something like “Clear all Metrics” or “Delete all Metrics”. I can’t quite remember.\n\nHowever, I think it would be rather silly to show a font without character spacing. Such a font does not exist, and displaying one belies the nature of type design. The white space around each glyph is as much a part of the glyph as the black “glyph” you see. And when you drew your letters at the beginning, I’m sure that you didn’t draw them so that their extremities were touching each other! You have always had space in your font, just not your final spacing. Deleting your metrics will not present an “earlier” version of your font… it will just confuse and mislead the viewer.\n\n"
