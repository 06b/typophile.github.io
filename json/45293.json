  "content": "Hi all — I’ve been tasked at my job to come up with a building signage package for a project we’re working on. My type skills are a bit rusty and I could use some thoughts. The only lettering on the building is shown in this photo. It’s cast metal lettering done in the late 1920s.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924105947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Door_6052.jpg)\n\nI see it as a sort of middle ground between a serif and a sans-serif, slightly whimsical but clean and modern. The building has very clean lines and few ornaments. Our historican calls it the “half-modern” style.\n\nMy sense is that this type over the door should be singular and all signage should pay respects to this without mimicry. I’ve been looking at modern, clean, sans-serifs for the majority of the signage. Most of the signs will be regulatory and identifying (tenant names, room identification, stairwell identification, etc.) but there may be some lengthier “exhibit” signage which talks about the history of the building. For that, I’ve been considering a serif header with sans-serif body but maybe the reverse would be best.\n\nIn any case, would love some brainstorms on fonts that you feel “go” with this sign.\n\nthanks,  \nAmanda\n\n [‹ Suitable font for 1920's Charleston poster](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924105947/http:/typophile.com/node/45376 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Need pairing suggestion ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924105947/http:/typophile.com/node/45359 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I remember when the Meier & Frank store was still around.\n\nIf you want something very close to that lettering then you might try Tobias Frere-Jones’s Grand Central:\n\n[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GrandCentral](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924105947/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GrandCentral \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GrandCentral\")\n\nSame period flavor.

It has a nice balance and rhythm to it.\n\nThanks for the other suggestions, I think Anisette is too contemporary and Binner Gothic too memorable and distinctive. This face needs to step back a bit and also be timeless.\n\n"
