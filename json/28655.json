And so the designer has a little more latitude with them.\n\nIn Paul Shaw's 'letter tour' of lower Manhattan that I went on a month ago we saw a lot of stone carved letters where eg, 1931 had only the 9 descending, not the 3. There were a number like this, with other letters same height on the top and the 9 descending. They were perfectly readable and didn't look odd; in fact many were quite nice.\n\nObviously a lot has to do with context. If you have an old style font, not following the convention for text figures is going to look out of place. But eg in an address or date or more modern face variations may look good.\n\n"

Phinney's blog is great example of thoughtful passion for a field without zealotry, and I'veenjoyed it for a while. The traditionalist view, in this case is important to me to understand.\n\nAnyone here who is inclinded to care knows that my most traditional fonts are pretty 'out there'; most are far past that. Nevertheless, I try to borrow legibilty and other tricks from the classical camp, so that the fonts can offer more utility than most display styles.\n\nIn this case, I'm working on a postmodern tall rectangular face with just enough ornamentation to seem... retro? It's a gift for my wife. Line figures were boring, text figures seem to both read better and add to the plyfulness intended. So, I've arranged the letters into the traditional lining, then fiddled with it very slightly.

The ascending 5 can look pretty cool and -- more to the point -- quite normal in some typefaces. My own opinion is that the figures should be made to blend in pleasantly with the text, and that is much more tricky than just following rules. Really, a lot of non-lining figures look bad because the designer just \"made the 4 descend\" without considering how it harmonizes with text. (I've had my own trouble with this very thing, so I sympathize.) I also am always interested to see cases of \"semi-lining\" figures and other strange hybrids. They can be educational case-studies about what works and what doesn't.\n\nIf you want to see an interesting real-world case, check out the changes in the non-lining figures between the original, Type 1 version of Utopia, and the figures in the OpenType version.\n\n"

Second, seeing that the terminals on the 6 and 9 would get crowded with the heavy strokes of the eye of the 6 and 9. Hence the idea of using a pointed terminal to reduce crowding.\n\nHowever, in the 235 you have the ball terminals opposite a thin part, so they don't crowd so much, meaning put too much weight together. And an important part of the 'look' of Utopia comes from the ball terminals on the a and c. The ball terminals on the 235 echo and reinforce this, particularly on text figures, which will go with the lower case. Also if you change 235 you probably have to change them on the lining figures, and further lose harmony with the face.\n\nHence this compromise to achieve the goal of making the text figures more compact.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>Christopher, why do you think the ball terminals were removed on the 6/9?</cite>\n\nThe theories above are as good as any. I remember talking with Robert about it at the time he made the changes, but I don't remember him explaining that. (Which is not to say I didn't just forget!)\n\nWhat's most interesting to me is that there is an overall improvement -- in that the figures just harmonize with the text more. Utopia is a good case for the this particular thread, I think, because the original figures always struck me as a little forced; they conform to the rules of how non-lining figures should be, but they were perhaps lacking design maturity, and never looked comfortable to me. Robert has learned a lot about such things since the early days when he made Utopia, so I think it's reflected in the changes. The figures are, overall, a bit smaller in scale, and all the ascending and descending figures don't look so stretched out. The proportions of each shape are more pleasant.\n\nAnyone designing non-lining figures who thinks, \"Just change the 3 to align with the lowercase x-height and descender height\" might also take some time to actually _look_ at the results. It's often not so simple.\n\nOf course the other thing going on with Utopia, I think, is that it's a sort of transitional-modern, and non-lining figures just don't always work as well with such designs. I use Utopia Std for a newsletter I make, and I think the lining figures work better -- so as much as I love Utopia, I still am hesitant to use its non-lining figures.\n\nProbably this is why such typefaces -- used so often for magazines and such -- often have more diminutive lining figures or some hybrid. There is less tradition with these more modern styles, and they often benefit from more experimental approaches, at least for type designers with good eyes who are willing to look and think about it.\n\n"

Looking at a display font, one could think, \"oh, look, a display font with text figures, how interesting\", or they could say, \"hmmm, I wonder why the numbers are all crooked-like. How lame.\" I'd prefer the former, if that was the intention. !Exclamachine's agenda is to make bizarre fonts that are more typographer-friendly, so I'm attacking that from several angles.\n\nAs far as the legibility, I will be doing a good bit of work on the weight, contrast and spacing. I will keep fidling with contours until I get a more pleasant 'carved' look.

No problem, said AF, and drew the designs on the spot, in a couple of seconds (Akira showed the sketch): but here's the kicker -- he drew the 4 standing on the baseline, not sitting. However as eventually implemented, it's sitting. I didn't have a chance to ask Akira about this (my reputation is churlish enough), but I did wonder.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nChoz -- You should try a version where your proportions are strictly conventional for OSF.
