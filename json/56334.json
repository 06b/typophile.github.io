  "content": "Hi all (and especially Adam or Nick, if you're here ;)\n\nAnyone know when MyFonts will update their sample renderer to use (GPOS) class kerning for the samples?  \nOr should I re-generate my fonts to include expanded old-style \"kern\" tables just to make the samples on MyFonts look good? (With the added benefit of them perhaps better supporting older applications kerning-wise?)\n\nMy \"problem\" at the moment is:  \nI have just released a batch of fonts on MyFonts.  \nA foundry's best selling font is used for the header on the foundry page.  \nMy current best seller is a font called \"Dynamic BRK Pro\", and its design means that without class kerning applied my foundry name reads like \"CheapP roF onts\"!  \nIt does not look good, and I'm afraid customers will think my fonts actually HAVE such abysmal kerning (which they don't)...\n\nHence my question.\n\nSo... Should I wait for MyFonts to improve their sample engine, or should I put \"legacy\" information in my fonts?\n\n",
