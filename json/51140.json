It recommends that groups move to Microsoft's Multiply.\n\nIn view of the large number of typographers who are members of these groups, and the extensive messages containing valuable advice exchanged over the years, I wonder whether Typophile could or would want to offer to host these groups, members, messages and all?\n\nOr at least invite members to join Typophile?\n\n",
