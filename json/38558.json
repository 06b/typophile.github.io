  "content": "Hello everybody. I've just been asked a question that I found a bit strange:  \n\"Do you know any sans typeface with the rt ligature?\" I was suprised, because I didn´t think how we could have a reason for doing so, because the genesis of both letters doesn´t justify it. My first reaction was \"Not even a serif typeface has that...!\" Even the queen of ligatures, Mrs Eaves doesn´t have one, but someone is telling me that it's very common and that has seen it frequently.  \nThe closest thing I saw was in carolingian script or a calligraphic exercise...  \nPeople, what do you think of that? Was I blind or is that person crazy?\n\n",

      "content": "I am guessing that a heavilly tracked sans had it's r & t collide producing a faux ligature. Some sans fonts are more prone to this than others. Looking at it a little it seems like the older the sans the more likely this is although I haven't looked in enough detail to make the claim stand.\n\nHere is an example of what I mean.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013112008im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tracking_3611.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you all for your opinion, but you've proven what I was thinking, so far, only the aestetics of a script or a serifed old style typefaces would justify that sort of ligature... :(  \nThat's a fine design, Nick, got to take a look a it!  \nFunny response Florian, but considering that I'm Portuguese, that kind of missunderstanding can´t be applied ;)  \nEben, that's a nice perspective, but the tracking is supposed to be zero. Besides, that kind of tracking starts to damage reading, especially for sans typefaces don´t you think?  \nThanks anyway :)\n\n"
