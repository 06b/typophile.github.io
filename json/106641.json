  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am planning to write my Masters Thesis about corporate typography and its effects in brand communication and I'm in dire need of some help in finding any kind of theoretic basis for my work.\n\nI have a Bachelors degree in Graphic Design, i feel at home, when it comes to the history of typography.  \nThere is a lot of material about the history of type anatomy of type etc. However im doing my Masters in Social Sciences, and there is very little, if any theoretic work about the effects of typography in visual communication or brand communication.\n\nAll major brands have fixed typefaces in their cvi books, some even design their own. So everybody seems to be sure that brand need their own typefaces, but why is it so, what are the effects of these typefaces in their communication is unknown.\n\nI'd be really grateful if anyone could help :)\n\n",
