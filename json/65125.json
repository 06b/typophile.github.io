  "content": "Usually I simply let acronyms stand in full caps, but my latest thing is just packed with acronyms (not a surprise when discussing NASA). Not being familiar with small caps, I just need to know whether to capitalize the first letter. Is it \"nasa\" or \"Nasa\" when in the middle of a sentence? And since my plan is to make small caps any acronym longer than 3 letters, would \"WF/PC\" be full caps or small caps?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

If it was me, I wouldn't capitalise NASA at all if you're using small caps already. I'm not a fan of caps used with small in the same word. I think to keep consistent with the rest of your acronyms, I would probably use small caps on the WF/PC as well.\n\nCan I ask why you're not using small caps for acronyms less than 3 letters?\n\n"
