  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am trying to identify the following font.  \nCurrently I got hired as a designer for a company as their old designer is fired, during the process of switching over I asked him what fonts he used and all I got was: \"You can find them online, just download the free ones\". As you can see not very helpful.\n\nIt is in regards to this product:  \n [http://s18.postimg.org/y98i26g1h/MPC\\_LOGO.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014141623/http:/s18.postimg.org/y98i26g1h/MPC_LOGO.jpg \"http://s18.postimg.org/y98i26g1h/MPC\\_LOGO.jpg\")\n\nDoing some searches online I first thought it was Nedian-Medium, but the \"E\" is really throwing me off here, also this one isn't free which the old designer seemed to hint too.\n\nAnybody any tips?\n\nThank you,  \nBen\n\nBtw, I does not have to be a free font. I just assumed he downloaded a free one, considering his helpful comments.\n\n",

But viewing the fonts at the same size it does indeed seem to be identical.\n\nAnd @hrant; I won't, no worries. But thanks for the tip, haha.\n\nThanks once again!\n\n"
