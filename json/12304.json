  "content": "I was wondering if anybody has worked out a technique for search & replace in FontLab that allows you to replace something without the replace causing an offset in the replaced object. I always seem to get a increase in height & negative horizontal position relative to the source & the target. Is Python the answer or is there a clever way of setting up the search to avoid this shift?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "That is sort of suggested in the documentation... I see. But you have explained the principle. :-) So then the strategy for making a replace of a whole object might be to replace one half & then the other - but always with two common points...\n\nGreat. I'll try it.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
