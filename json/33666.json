  "content": "Hey everyone, this is my first post, hope you could help me with this...\n\nJust wondering what this typeface used for the DESIGN MUSEUM's identity is. I thought it could be some form of Din (because of the straight leg of the R) but the S is nothing like any Din, it has much more of an extreme curve.\n\n[http://www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111121245/http:/www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions \"http://www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions\")\n\nsorry my terminology is terrible\n\nany suggestions for typefaces of this sort would be a big help too. I'm currently working on typographically illustrating Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell for my project at uni. Im looking for a very clinical looking font that has impact and authority on a page that can also represent the uniformity of life. I'm thinking maybe something mono-linear.\n\nI would love to be able to afford Akkurat, but i am only a student.\n\n",
