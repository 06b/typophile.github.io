      "content": "I have many, but these are my current favorites:\n\n- [FF Balance](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=balance) - This has so much character merely because the stress is horizontal rather than vertical. Looks great every time I see it (which is sadly too rare).\n- [FF Strada](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=strada) - Simple forms mixed with some organic terminals and a thoughtful italic. Mmm. [Another sample of FF Strada.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/static.flickr.com/14/20098053_1f82de0bbc_o.jpg)\n- [FF Quadraat Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.10989.0.0) - There is experienced method behind the lack of uniformity.\n- [FF Profile](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11100.0.0) - Has a friendly air for less serious texts.\n- [FF Legato](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=legato) - This groundbreaking design requires some reading to fully appreciate. [Start&nbsp;here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/typographi.com/000969.php)\n- [Versa Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=versa%20sans) - More brilliance from a Dutch master.\n- [Freight Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=GF.118889.0.0) - Excellent [complimentary styles](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/) available too. I recommend loosening the spacing a tad.\n- [Amplitude](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=amplitude) - The Normal and Wide are really great for small print.\n- [Lisboa Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223818/http:/www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000081) - Veer mailed a sans poster a few weeks ago and this new release was the most impressive on the sheet.\n\n"

The spacing of this typeface has always been a bit problematical, but I'm impressed once again by how well it works for continuous text of this sort, i.e. interrupted by frequent illustrations that readers will typically pause to enjoy. This is the sort of context in which a sans serif can work quite well.\n\n"
