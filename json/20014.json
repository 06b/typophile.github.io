Actual scripts have to be in Courier, because then they are approximately one minute per page, which is convenient for comparison and production. But produced for reading, American Typewriter, which is proportionally spaced, is more readable.\n\n\\>portability between different platforms and versions?\n\nAmerican Typewriter comes in an [Open type version](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202182031/http:/www.myfonts.com/PurchaseOptions?familyid=3479&id%5B%5D=10035&id%5B%5D=11096), so yes.\n\nYour work group would all need it on their machines for them to edit documents. Yes, PDFs work fine for distribution, but they won’t be editable, I believe.\n\nI know some programmers and some lawyers use Courier. And I don’t really know why lawyers want to use it.\n\nThere are really better options for almost every purpose, though.\n\n"
