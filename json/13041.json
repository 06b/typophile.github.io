I turned invisibles on and there is record of a space but it does not appear.\n\nAnyone having this problem?\n\n— Jer\n\n [‹ Is Rosewood Fill the new Comic Sans?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071123092633/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21280 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Graffiti ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071123092633/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17196 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Still working on it.\n\n"

      "content": "The one solution I’ve found to this issue is to convert the font to individual .pfb files with [Fondu](http://web.archive.org/web/20071123092633/http:/fondu.sourceforge.net/#Fondu) and then convert these files to a more useful format. I have used FontForge for this. Based on the [Emigre FAQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20071123092633/http:/www.emigre.com/FAQ.php), I think this kind of conversion is allowed:\n\n<cite>The Emigre Fonts license does allow the user to convert the fonts to other formats as long as the user has purchased the appropriate user license and the converted fonts continue to be used in accordance with this license. In addition, the converted fonts must retain the original Emigre copyright notice.</cite>\n\nAfter conversion, the spaces appear as expected.\n\n"
