  "content": "An extensive search of \"Bulgarian Alphabet\" (in English) on the Internet reveals that the \"standard\" [Cyrillic](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825205937/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cyrillic) alphabet and fonts are used in [Bulgaria](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825205937/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bulgaria). There is nothing peculiar, except if one happens across the Hermes type foundry, or visits Bulgarian-language Cyrillic web sites and notices plain type styles with seeming Latin intrusions.\n\nHermes, in Bulgaria, is a quality outfit, with a good range of type styles, and all of them utilize a special Bulgarian alphabet.  \nIn it, eleven upright (\"roman\") characters differ from the usual Cyrillic form, by using the Cyrillic italic forms -- either just straightened up, or with extenders, or stretched. In general the effect is one of Latinizing, despite the italic and script precedents for Cyrillic ascenders.\n\nAlso, there are at least eight accented/stressed characters (with grave accent) which are either not otherwise stressed in Cyrillic, or stressed with the dieresis instead.\n\nDetails of how to substitute these characters in OpenType fonts have been provided in the Build forum -- but I am interested here in the history, politics, people and practicality of the whole situation.\n\nThis is a movement which requires a group of type designers to be on side, as well as the local design community, and scholars, educationalists, orthographers, and government to some extent.\n\nSo what's the story?  \nHow well established is the Hermes-flavoured Cyrillic alphabet in Bulgaria?\n\nAnd now that Bulgaria is in the European Union, will the Hermes-promoted Bulgar-Cyrillic alphabet become more entrenched there, and possibly make inroads elsewhere?\n\n",

This form also shows up outside of Bulgaria.\n\nThanks for linking to the newspaper examples, Miguel. Most of them seem to be using a mix of different styles of Cyrillic typefaces—traditional, Bulgarian, and just standard Cyrillic cursive forms.\n\nBy standard Cyrillic cursive forms, I just mean that the forms used in the typical Cyrillic cursive have been adopted for the upright letters. Look at the _Труд (Trud)_ example to see what I mean. Bulgarian forms go further and add ascenders on some of these letters, which I personally have a hard time liking. I get the need to break up the monotony of all the letters confined to the x height, but an ascender on the ю (yu) just seems illogical.\n\n"
