Takes a fairly different style of playing though.\n\nAs for the Orange amps, my friend had a nice sounding 4x10 or 4x12 Orange cabinet many years ago. Although, at this point I'm sure it's the company in name only (sort of like Danelectro, although their reissues are pretty nice cheap guitars).\n\n"
