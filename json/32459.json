  "content": "I'm a sophmore in Design School in NYC, and lately, I've just been thinking about how much of a waste of money it is.\n\nI have two studio classes in my major (graphic design) that seem like I just go for the attendance. One class in particular, the teacher is often late and we have a quick class discussion about the work we put up, then class is over.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoy being in college, but overall, I look at the work I'm doing, and its just almost worthless. I'm usually towards the top of the class, but most of the things we're doing are exercises or small projects. A lot of non-real world stuff. Often times we have like 4 weeks to do small projects too.\n\nI know I'm improving, but still. All the ideas are mine, and I've had to learn a lot of the programs' tricks on my own. I guess its no different from liberal arts programs though.\n\nSo, I assume a lot of other people on the board have been through design school.\n\nI know this wasn't the best written, but maybe someone can reassure me its worth such a large amount of money.\n\n",

Some people will become great designers without having set foot in a design school Others would fair better at one school, rather than an other. Since you are only in your Sophomore year, perhaps it is not too late to transfer to another institution, if you feel like you'd like more intellectual challenges and/or student–teacher interaction.\n\n"

In between the assignments, exploit this access as much as you can while you still don't have to buy the software yourself at the prices designed for businesses. College is an environment in which to tinker with lots of different stuff at low risk. Occasionally, you might even learn something useful from one of your teachers, but don't count on it. The social network will be more significant.\n\nThe key: Do whatever you can to get work in the field _before you graduate._ Because when you graduate, you'll be competing with everybody who graduated at the same time as you for the same few jobs. And not long _after_ you graduate, your diploma will be worth jack diddly zero.\n\n"

I too used to look at school assignments in comparison to 'real work': thing is that school isn't the real thing. Be glad, because this way you can experiment a way thats not always possible in 'the real world'.\n\nFurthermore, school is about discovering and enriching yourself by learning from teachers, other students and so on. If you feel there's a gap between your wishes and the curriculum, maybe take it up with that one \"good\" teacher. Maybe he can help you with either a switch or an extended curriculum?\n\nIn the end, for me, it was worth the while. Too bad i'm not in school any more...  \nBest of Luck, Marco\n\n"

He's inspired and push me beyond my limits and patience and its been great. It takes a few great teachers to help you along the path. Ive found that the harder the cclass the better your work, and the better you become.\n\nMy opinion of school here is lame, It's way to expensive, no one can afford it, but if we want to do anything with our lives (for the most part) we have to get a degree. So get one. My girlfriend went to school for 8 years paying for it her self, shes noow a massage therapist, atheltic trainer, and phyiscal therapist with a doctorate. She'll be paying off her school for the next additional 40 or so years. Drives us both nuts.\n\nEnough rambling, time to get back to work.\n\nHang in there, its worth it in the very long run.\n\n"

This came up a few issues back in Comm Arts; design schools are teaching curricula invented for the mid-twentieth century, but it's 2007. From the conversations I've had with design teachers about this I know that they are aware of the problem, but most of them don't know how to get past it. They don't understand that the new generation of designers really don't need a month or two and fifty revisions of sketches just to design a book cover.\n\nThere are some younger teachers who get it, teachers who came of age when Postmodernism was exploding, but it's going to be another decade or two until they're deciding how design schools function. Until then, design students just have to suck it up, learn what we can while in school, and then move on with our lives. The important thing to remember is that there is still a universal method of dealing with the problem: everybody needs to get together a couple times a month to drink beer, eat pizza, and kvetch.\n\n"

What the design school is actually doing (or at least trying to do) is not trying to teach you to design a book cover, or anything else specific. Instead they are trying to teach you to see differently, to be creative, and to think in a problem-solving manner. College is not about job training. Your career will far outlive any technical specifics that you will learn in college… most of us will be working for several decades. A 21-year old graduating in the USA in 2007 will probably have to spend the next 50 years working before he'll be able to retire. The creativity will stay with him much longer than whatever multimedia gimmick he had to learn for one class or the other.\n\n"

Artists before them didn't have things like reams of cheap tracing paper, light tables, graphite pencils or synthetic erases, and they worked differently.

When I was in design school in NYC, the only \"drafting\" we did was on a table, with a T-square, a wonderful mechanical pencil with big leads, and a funky sharpener.\n\nArchitecture schools gloss over that now, and presume everyone knows AutoCAD and will take rough sketches straight to a computer, which is fine, except that doing it the old way sure gives you an advantage in thinking about how things actually go together.\n\nQuick example: a surveyor friend of mine was laying out some roads in a new subdivision when the developer's plans changed and an extra entry from an existing road was drawn in by someone back in the office on a computer.\n\nNow, while it was easy enough to put the nice radially curved bit of roadway in on the computer to link the two, once they tried to do it out in the field, it was a joke: the roadbed only ran 20 feet and the curve had a 4-mile radius. Needless to say, they made it straight in the field. :-)\n\nIf the designer had learned on paper, it would have never happened.....\n\n"

Envisioning implies understanding a problem, thinking a creative (original and effective) way to solve it and planning it's realization.\n\nThis means that it is more important to know what has to be done than being able to do it (specially if you don't know what to do). The highest design positions are focused on envisioning and directing the creative work of others. Those with only the ability to make the tricks get to be production artists.\n\nDesign education will try to teach you how to envision but also will give you other valuable tools such as a title, communication theory, semiotics, history classes, marketing understanding, technical training, social networking, production experience and a program to grow by an adequate path (not in a chaothic and crippled way).\n\nDon't expect fast outcome, take the time needed to train you for a lifelong career. I passed the first year of design school drawing models, taking art history courses, doing color charts, line grids and abstract excercises. It was until the second year that we were able to tackle some \"real life\" design projects and made corporate identity until the last semester (out of 8). Otherwise it's like entering the karate class and wanting to do the ninja stuff on the first month.\n\nIf you can afford it I would recommend design school, if not I would recommend trying to follow the program by your own.

And I cannot address the question of the quality of design schools in general, nor of course of 'supermanism's school in particular.\n\nHowever, as a former college teacher I can speak to the other half of the equation: student's role in his or her own education.\n\nThe students I enjoyed most were those who had been out in the world of work and returned for further education. They had these characteristics:\n\n1. They knew why they were studying. They didn't just drift into studies for lack of another option, but had a goal.\n\n2. They were willing to challenge the teachers, including me. When I say challenge, I mean regularly ask thoughtful questions, including asking what is the benefit of studying what you are studying. I don't mean to do this in an angry or impertinent way, but rather in expectation that there is an answer, and you want to learn it.\n\n3. They know that the teachers are working for them. They are paying the bill, and they seek out instruction. If one teacher is not the best in something they want to learn, they find another. If that person is not in their school, they will go to a person in another place--school or private sector--for supplement, or change schools.\n\nIn sum returning students tend not to whine about their education, but to seek out excellence in instruction or go elsewhere. This quality of initiative, rather than passivity, is one of the best things a student can have to get the most out of school.\n\n"

If you feel that the classes you attend are not challenging enough, start your own projects; create a magazine, learn how to use a press and make posters, start a collective, design a typeface, learn a new skill, create something that will be of use once you leave school. If a professor gives you an assignment to design a logo, go ahead do the entire brand.  \nGet the idea?  \nLook, there will always be issues with the institution you attend, and its curricula; it is also up to you how to address those issues. Maybe there is an awareness campaign that needs to be done. Look at everything as an opportunity for you to shine. Believe it or not you are being watched closely by your peers and professors. They are your first network in your career, so go ahead and impress the hell out of them.  \nBest  \nAlejandro Chavetta\n\n"
