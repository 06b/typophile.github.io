      "content": "I would suggest another of Hermann Zapf's sans serif designs, since he is the designer of Palatino Linotype. Unfortunately for this case, most of his designs are serifs. The closest to a sans serif that he has in digital form is Optima.   \n   \nOptima is his most well-known non-Palatino design, but it isn't _exactly_ a sans serif.   \n [http://www.linotype.com/54142/optimanova-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416042015/http:/www.linotype.com/54142/optimanova-family.html)   \n   \nIf you can wait ahile, Linotype will soon release **Palatino Sans** , a completely new typeface from Hermann Zapf and Akira Kobayashi that was previewed at TypeCon in July.   \n   \nIf you need something now (which you probably do), and Optima doesn't get your boat sailing, I would suggest any of Adrian Frutiger's designs as a good starting point\n\n"
