  "content": "Hi  \nWhat do you think of the letters? What can i do better? i draw letters very seldom, so any feedback is welcome. I have a feeling the ’s’ and the’e’ could be better. I looked at a couple of fonts that at first glance looked suitable, but wouldn’t do the trick. So I started drawing myself, keeping an eye at the features i liked in the initial fonts.\n\nThe logo is for a industrial design company. Serious but friendly etc. THe name is Kode Design.\n\nThanks!\n\nalex\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821142541im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/KOdeDEsign_3577.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_070507\\_2\\_af.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821142541/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_070507_2_af.pdf) | 217.26 KB |\n| [fatter\\_g\\_descender.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821142541/http:/typophile.com/files/fatter_g_descender.pdf) | 239.55 KB |\n\n [‹ Crit my logo (sort of a joke)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821142541/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33441 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [typographic institutional logo: have at it ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821142541/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33590 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Also, your ascenders/descenders seem rather staunch.\n\nWhat kind of products do Kode Design design? I’m curious also about the decision behind choosing Blue and Black for the color scheme. if you’re flexible with color choices, I’d consider something more subtle. It’s clever that you picked out KO and DE, but the color choices feel as if you’re pushing this idea down my throat instead of me slowly realizing it. Make it more subliminal.\n\n"

      "content": "I think it´s very nice. And for the “serious but friendly” part, it´s right on the spot. I think you should keep the colors.  \nHere´s some suggestments:  \nThe ascender on the bottom d may be too short, make a printout in small sizes to check!  \nThe ending on g should be more like that of e, at least in thickness.  \nThe ending on e looks a bit flat in the middle, try shortening it for a more fluent ending.  \nThe s needs some more weight in the middle. This will also make the endings less flat, which is a good thing.  \nThe flared stroke on d and k may be applied on i, for consinstency  \nMaybe you could do a whole typeface out of this?\n\n"

Here are my comments on shapes and etc.:\n\nThe “e” looks more condensed than the other letters, also, the way the counter and the beginning of the terminal (left part right below the counter doesn’t look like it’s flowing too well).\n\nYour “g” has a curved feel as opposed to a more vertical “d” - I’d go one way or another - not both.\n\nThe top anchor point on the lower case “n” is going from straight to round. Maybe smoothing that out would help consistency.\n\nI’d test the ascenders without angles. Agree with toby about the “i” in case you want to keep the angle.\n\nThe “s” looks lighter than the rest. Drawing S’s is a pain in the s if you allow me a poetic license.\n\nIt’s going to look nice when you’re done!\n\nOne more vote for making it a typeface.\n\nRodrigo\n\n"

The slanted crossbar of the ’e’ is somewhat distracting, in my opinion, since it is a slant none of the other characters have. And about the colors, the blue looks a bit RGB-ish to me. The cyan was looking much more natural, although it needed some attention too.\n\nI’m sorry if I’m sounding a bit harsh, just giving my opinions. I think the first  \n(or second, slightly adjusted) version is still the best. :)\n\n"

And the therminals (’s’, ’e’, ’g’) get awfully thin, when compared to the ’normal’ stroke width.  \nThe old ’g’ too childish? Maybe, but it was consistent as well.\n\nBut your outlines seem quite smooth. Only the top of the ’g’ can use some attention (where the bowl connects to the top-right corner). I might make the curve the same as the ’n’ (only mirrored of course).\n\nAs for the color, it has this PMS Reflex/Process Blue vibe going on now, if you know what I mean. With a touch of RGB-ness. I don’t know, maybe you can go through a PMS swatchguide to pick one in the vicinity of the color you have now, that looks a bit more natural. :)\n\n[edit] fixed typo.\n\n"
