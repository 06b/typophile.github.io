      "content": "Putting ink on paper has been done in a number of ways, especially in the 20th century. What is a \"good\" typeface depends on how that was done -- letterpress? offset? And within offset, repro-negative-plate, or direct to plate? And within a repro-negative-plate workflow, was the repro pulled from metal fonts, or photocomp fonts?\n\nRefining that further, in the photocomp days, type was proprietary. What might be a good font on a Linotype 202 might not be a good font on a Monotype VideoComp.\n\nEtc.\n\nThough if you're asking about \\*design\\* without regard to putting ink on paper, you might get different answers.\n\n"
