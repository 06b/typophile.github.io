  "content": "Hi, I am looking for a typeface which refers to a [plotter font](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020051518/http:/www.isoplotec.co.jp/HPGL/SampleLBSL.GIF).  \nI am talking about those special system fonts of a cutting plotter, which just consists of one single line, so you can't use them as actual fonts for writing and stuff. They don't have curves at all, they have those small squared steps which simulate some sort of curve.\n\nOr do you have any idea, where I could find a survey of a complete characterset of a font like this? So in that case I would be able to create a font by myself.\n\nI hope, this request isn't too confusing … ;)\n\n",
