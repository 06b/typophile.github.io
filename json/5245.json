Here is the first draft of my newest font \"BackRiver\" These are the only characters so far and no text block is available (I don't have fontographer yet). But I love to hear what everybody thinks of it. I'll try to attach a swf now.\n\n<center><table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150414163544im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_gif.gif\" align=\"LEFT\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">backriver.swf<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150414163544/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/backriver.swf\"><b>backriver.swf</b></a> (4 k)</td></tr></table></center>!-/attachment-!\\>!-attachment:\\> \n",
