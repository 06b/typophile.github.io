  "content": "Thanks for glancing at this. Our current logo is a bit complex so we're trying to transition to a simpler high-contrast idea, also we'd like to migrate from the full name (new life campus fellowship) to just the letters as a standalone name. It's a inter-denominational university church if that helps.   \n   \nHere's a few first rough steps in freehand, I'd love your input on how I should get started. My inspiaration is 50's countertop modernist retro feel.   \n   \nHow do I keep it from being too comical?   \n   \n ![FIRST WAVE](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021030819im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35014.gif)\n\n",
