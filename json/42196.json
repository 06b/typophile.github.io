I tried on Photoshop cs2, illustrator cs2, word 2003,and Indesigncs2. But while I am writting the email I tried test in Freehand Mx and fantastic, the type run perfectly with the kerning! but.... why don’t run in other software?\n\nThank you,  \nIván\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080320064342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/screenshoot2_5501.jpg)\n\n"

So you could add something like\n\n`feature ornm {\n  sub bullet by bullet;\n} ornm;`\n\nto the OpenType panel. It doesn’t really matter so much what substitution feature the font has, but of course it would make sense if the feature would be somewhat meaningful and somehow related to your typeface.\n\nA.\n\n"
