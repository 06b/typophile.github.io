I am doing a project for someone and I plan on having large and bold arial type, but I wanted it to be distressed and I was wondering how to go about it. Suggestions are wanted, thanks much.\n\n",

Click on the Photoshop tab, and then scroll through the list of tips on the left-hand side of the page. Of note are the Grunge Type, Worn Out Type, and Quick Grunge tips.   \n   \nHope this helps you get started.\n\n"

      "content": "Some other methods ...   \n   \nIn Illustrator, create outlines on your type, then go to   \n   \nObject \\> Path \\> Simplify   \n   \nType in a value of 90-95 percent. This will   \nstrip your type of points and give it a more   \nbeat up look.   \n   \nThen also mix in   \n   \nFilter \\> Distort \\> Roughen   \n   \nsize, 1 to 2 percent   \ndetail, 10 to 20   \n   \nThis will add more points.   \n   \nYou can then go back to simplify.   \n   \nThis will just affect the perimeter, however.   \n   \nTo get inside, i use one of these templates below ...   \n   \nI made a bunch of them a couple of years ago.   \n   \nIn Photoshop, select the black with the Magic Wand, then   \nselect Similar. Fill with White.   \n   \nOverlay the white distressed file on top of your black type.   \nBlur some. Then Flatten and go   \n   \nMode \\> Bitmap \\> 50 percent threshold.   \n   \nThen back up to Grayscale, blur some more,   \nmaybe overlay the file again rotated differently,   \nthan back down to Bitmap, etc. etc.   \n   \nAlso, you can mix in the airbrush tool on DISSOLVE setting.   \n   \nIf these don't give you the effect you're after,   \nyou can contact me offline.   \n   \na not-so-professional tutorial but maybe it'll help.   \n   \nbj\n\n<!--attachment: distress_11_tiff-21647.zip*attachment_icon.gif*application/zip*55.9 **distress%2e11%2etiff%2ezip --><!--attachment: distress_11_tiff-21647.zip*attachment_icon.gif*application/zip*55.9** distress%2e11%2etiff%2ezip -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131019082742im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/zip\"><br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131019082742/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/distress_11_tiff-21647.zip\" target=\"_blank\"><b>distress.11.tiff.zip</b></a> (55.9 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n"
