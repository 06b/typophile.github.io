They seem to have lightened up lately so maybe they did get their wrists slapped. Too bad there isn't someone from Linotype here to comment on the facts.\n\nThere are plenty of things I don't remember, but when someone screws with a nice person I know, I have a hard time letting go.\n\n"

      "content": "The name 'Helvetica' _as applied to a typeface_ is a Linotype trademark. Names of _typefaces_ that are close to that name, especially if deliberately so, fall within the typical bounds of trademark infringement as set by existing laws. If you want to preserve a trademark, you have to defend it. Every time you fail to defend your trademark, you weaken it, because in a subsequent case the defendant can say 'Look, they have not rigorously defended their trademark when it was infringed on this occasion'. That, unfortunate or absurd as the results may sometimes be, is the situation in which trademark owners are obliged to operate.\n\nThe situation for digital fonts is complicated by their status as software. We wanted to call a font Oracle a few years ago, but were advised against it by a lawyer on the grounds that Oracle is an established trademark in the software business. Presumably if we had been making metal type, this would not have been an issue.\n\n"

      "content": "It should be noted that there is a difference between a claimed trademark and a registered trademark. A trademark can be claimed simply by a statement claiming that 'X is a trademark of...'. The requirements for such a claim are that the trademarked product is in the marketplace, and that you defend that trademark against infraction. If someone uses your trademark and you fail to defend the trademark, then you can lose it. If you have claimed a trademark and someone else comes along and claims that you are infringing their trademark, then you need to be able to prove that your use of the trademark precedes theirs.\n\nThe situation for a registered trademark is actually very similar: you still need to actively defend your trademarks or risk losing them. But the fight will be easier because the registration process requires proof up front that you have a right to the trademark and that it does not impinge on anyone else's trademark. This requires a trademark search, which can be very expensive, especially if you want to register internationally in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nGiven how expensive the registration process is, and the _requirement_ to actively defend your trademarks, one can hardly blame companies for taking a hard line on anything that can be perceived as trademark infringement: if they let anything pass by without a challenge, that can be taken as insufficient defense of the trademark, and it may be lost.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> _There are certain names that cannot be trademarked. You can not run willy-nilly with trademarks. There is government regulation and oversight._\n\nI think the problem we are facing regarding typefaces and their names is the WAY people now search for type.\n\nGiven the fact that there is an active community of type users (and type buyers), I hazard a guess that the majority of searches are done on the web and not through hardcopy catalogs and/or promo material.\n\nGiven the fact that many new designers (and users of type) may not know the more established type foundries, type designers, font vendors and developers, a simple search for _Leporello_ may yield (theoretically) two or more sources -- one on a font distributor site as Leporello™ and one on a \"Free Font\" site listed as LePorellow (a type rip-off with no trademark info).\n\nIn the past, there was legal recourse since the majority of type foundries were known to each other and could be confronted. But today, a font could be knocked-off relatively easy and placed for download on the web quite quickly and anonymously.\n\nThe trade-protection of type relies both on the industry itself AND the consumers. Back in the old twentieth-century, designers would often insist on using specific typefaces from reputable foundries. Today the type using market is less likely to care about where it came from but how much it costs if anything.\n\nFor some reason (I can hazard a guess why) brand names are still highly vested among consumers. This is a chief reason why trademarking typeface names is the strongest option for protecting type at this time.\n\n"

The branding of a typeface is therefore critical all the way up to \"font selection\" menu.\n\nHistorically it wasn't always a major branding issue each time a typeface was released, and in fact, many type houses never used names (just catalog numbers) for a great majority of faces during the photo-headline heydays.\n\nBut thanks to the MarketingGods, EVERYTHING in the friggin' commercial universe is branded, trademarked and promoted up the Yin-Yang! And whenever money is to be made, legal battle lines are drawn to protect or defeat the investors.\n\nMaybe Prince was on the right track for a (short) while when he tried re-branding himself as a glyph with no name.\n\n_The typeface formerly known as \"Leporello\" by Chris Lozos_\n\n"
