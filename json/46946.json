  "content": "Hi everyone. I am looking for a face similar to [Archer](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906195841/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100033) Italic. I love the whimsical aesthetic, with the curved serif’s, but I’ve been unable to find anything remotely similar.\n\nYou may ask, why not just use Archer? Good question, the client is unable to dish out $300 for the package. So budget is an obstacle (what else is new, right?).\n\nAny help would be fantastic. Thanks so much.\n\n [‹ Ordinal Baseline](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906195841/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46887 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Baskerville Variation?
