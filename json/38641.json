I’m looking for a book with information on how to start drawing type/typeface; something for beginners.\n\nAny suggestions more than welcome...\n\nThanks.

(from the referred thread).\n\nI have to vouch for these books. I just got them, and recently finished reading the latter, and have browsed the former extensively. They are absolutely the best resources I have seen for beginning type design. (Note: they expect you to have mastered Illustrator or another vector program first).\n\n"
