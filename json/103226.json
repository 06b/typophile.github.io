In fact the \"c\" (and to a lesser extent the \"o\") is the only really malformed glyph. The \"s\" -a very difficult letter to make well- is tellingly clean, it's just horizontally stretched.\n\nSo my guess is it's either a one-off logo based on a mainstream font, or yet another plagiarized/butchered free font.\n\nhhp\n\n"
