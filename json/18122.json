However, I think you could get a somewhat similar feel from [Sign DNA's 'Chicago Style'](http://web.archive.org/web/20100323040717/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg9.html), or even [Adobe Caflisch Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20100323040717/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0002937).\n\nSome of House's painter scripts, and their 'Fabulous', as well as a couple of Jason Walcott's scripts (Jukebox Foundry at Veer.com) might also be close enough substitutes.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
