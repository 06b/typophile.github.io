  "content": "Hi, I’m new here. I actually came upon this site in looking up something for my advertising class. I’m an advertising major and I was wondering if anyone here works in advertising. I have an assignment for my mass media class to interview someone from the field of advertising. I am an aspiring copywriter and while I know this site is for typography, I was wondering if anyone here holds that title and if so would you be willing to give me your name, the company you work for and answer the following questions. The questions are not limited to those in copywriting; any position in advertising will be useful.\n\nWhat is/was your job position/title in advertising?\n\nWhat are the duties for this position?\n\nWhat company do/did you work for?\n\nWhat was your major in college? Did this help you in your career? If so, in what way?\n\nHow many hours a week would you say you put in for this job?\n\nAverage salary for your position? (not necessarily the amount you make, unless you feel comfortable giving that information)\n\nDescribe the job atmosphere and interactions with clients/co workers/superiors\n\nHave you worked in other countries or cities with the same title? If so what was the difference between the them in respects to the job?\n\nWhy did you get into advertising?\n\nIf you feel other info might be helpful please include. If you have any questions feel free to IM me or post here. I actually need this by 2pm tomorrow. I’d hate to put anybody in that situation so my apologies, but my original interviewee did not get back to me in time so this is a last minute substitution. Thank you so much. Have a blessed night!\n\n [‹ +&-=X Exhibition](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122027/http:/typophile.com/node/33101 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [FontExplorer Crucial Criteria Conflict ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122027/http:/typophile.com/node/33093 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
