Will your reader understand that your example blackletter types postdate the nameplate, and thus could not themselves have \"informed\" the design of it?\n\nAnd, using the word \"customized font\" implies that a whole alphabet of individual type sorts was made for the newspaper, when (as I understand it) if it was indeed a custom nameplate, it would have been a single piece and thus not properly called a \"font\" (and probably not properly called \"type\").\n\n"

(sorry if I'm asking questions an intro text on graphic design would just as easily answer).\n\nFlorian & everyone else: how about: \"The paper's nameplate employs handtooled Gothic typefaces in an otherwise distinguished, uncluttered front-page banner.\"\n\n"

Carefully drawn, built-up letters, as opposed to calligraphy in which the strokes of the letter are usually a single width of the pen or brush being held at a particular angle.\n\nI think your final sentence is fine, but maybe mention that it was the look almost universal to newspapers then rather than something particularly unique to this one.\n\n"
