I know that Value and Service  \nvery rarely design there own fonts (although they did add  \nligatures to Helvetica). I’ll be working a floor above them in a  \nmonth or so, so I could always ask for you :P, or you could  \ndrop them an email\n\nThe second one I’m not sure. Looks a like Akkurat  \n( [www.lineto.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813170618/http:/www.lineto.com/ \"www.lineto.com\")) in the light weight, except most obviously,  \nAkkurat has a double storey ’g’ and this does not. But if you  \nlook at that ’g’ it looks really quite badly drawn, so perhaps it  \nis Akkurat Light but with a custom ’g’. The uppercase looks  \nvery similar.\n\nPhil\n\n"
