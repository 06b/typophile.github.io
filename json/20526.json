  "content": "hello\n\na friend of mine is looking for the following:  \na gentle but not weak - with a certain strength to it - serif typeface without too much stroke-contrast. ligatures are very important (as many as possible), swashes would be good, too. it will get used for display, not for text.\n\nany ideas?  \nthanks!\n\n",

I'd rather have a spokesperson for a certain foundry anonymously posting helpful information under the foundry's name than some Billy Sastard annoying the hell out of everyone.\n\nHear hear, I think it's safe for me to proclaim that shameless self-promotion is tolerated and even encouraged on Typophile _whenever it's appropriate_. In this case everyone was indeed pointing out typefaces of their own with lots of ligatures, which was the actual request by the original poster. Well done.\n\nBTW I think both Musee and Odille kick some major booty. Especially Odille has had me all giddy with excitement waiting for its release. Fabulous job -- eat this all ye black-clad, goatee-stroking DIN and Helvetica adepts. :^D\n\nAnd I still like Mrs Eaves. A lot. It's deliciously awkward and very hard to use well, but when you succeed -- oh boy does it pay off. ;^)\n\n"
