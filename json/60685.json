  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am currently working on a logo and branding project for a new shop selling organic handmade soap. I am really stuck on what typefaces I could use. The client's company is sort of like LUSH, they use a lot of spices and herbs in their soaps.\n\nWould anyone be able to point me in the right direction of some typefaces you think could be suitable for such a job..?\n\nBest,  \nJames\n\n",
