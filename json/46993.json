  "content": "Can anyone tell me what the design influences were in the making of Glosa? I can't find this information on dstype.com. Thinking about using it as the supporting typeface for all communications on an ID project I'm doing. I used Mercury for the logo, but the client can't afford to shell out $1,200+ for a typeface (it's for my church, tight budget). They will need to use it in-house, so they'll need to buy everything that we specify.\n\nI like Glosa because it reminds me a bit of both Scotch Romans and Dutch Fleischmanns. It feels quite appropriate for my (Presbyterian) church. Anyone know the backstory? I see Dino's icon lurking down at the bottom...perhaps he would be so kind as to elucidate for me :)\n\nCheers,  \nMatt\n\n",

      "content": "Matt,\n\nWith Glosa I intended to design something with no exact historical reference, I wanted a typeface that seemed to be traveling through the years from the types cutted by Fleischmann to a more contemporary approach. Obviously it's possible to find some references in the details like the perfect ball terminals and sharped serifs. Above all, I wanted the typeface to be extremely readable and rigid, yet modern and fresh.\n\nDino\n\n"

      "content": "Matt,\n\nWhere are you getting $1200.00 as a price for Mercury? There are many, many choices of bundles to choose from. Look at the [product page](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014164428/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100017&cpuCount=1&variantTypeID=2) for Mercury with one workstation. Do you need to license the fonts for several workstations? Do you require every display and every text cut of the design, in all 4 grades? I'm mystified when people express interest in a typeface and then reject it because of price without investigating all the options. There are very few type families out there with a $1200.00 pricetag. Most typefaces are available in single weights or as basic families with 4 styles.\n\n"
