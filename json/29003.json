My first guess was a modified version of [Carbon](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104006/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/carbon/bold/) from T-26, but the X is straight and the inside of the O is rounded. Any other fonts similar to that?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [minfont.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104006/http:/typophile.com/files/minfont.jpg) | 9.08 KB |\n| [exofont.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104006/http:/typophile.com/files/exofont.jpg) | 8.52 KB |\n\n",
