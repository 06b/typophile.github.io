      "content": "Thanks.\n\nAttached is the phrase HUDSON'S BAY in WalbaumMT expanded by 134%, i.e. so that the width to height ratio of capital O matches Engraver's RomanBT. Not quite right. But when it is expanded 155%, i.e. so that the width to height ratio of capital S matches, it's pretty close.\n\nWith some letter to letter adjustments, and minor changes to the serif design and the top left stroke extension for A [and probably for M & N], Walbaum could work as a font approximation of this wordmark. Can't use it for anything unless I start from my own Walbaum digitized from an old time print specimen and use a new trade name.\n\nDon\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130806022527im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WalbaumMTexpanded134percent_6020.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130806022527im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WalbaumMTexpanded155percent_5969..jpg)\n\n"
