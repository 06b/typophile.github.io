Although it's a close match to the printed piece, Adobe Garamond's upward-tilting top-stroke of the **5** , and the unclosed bowls of the **6** and the **9** rule it out.\n\nIt is, I think, Peter Baker's Garamond-esque freeware font for medievalists, [Junicode](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019234217/http:/junicode.sourceforge.net/), or its predecessor JuniusModern, from the [Old English Font Pack](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019234217/http:/www.faculty.virginia.edu/OldEnglish/index.html) (which had the old-style numerals in default position, rather than as an opentype option, as in Junicode).\n\n[See this image of the relevant Junicode characters](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019234217/http:/img197.imageshack.us/img197/8528/picture2a.png).\n\n"
