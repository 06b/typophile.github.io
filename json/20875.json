  "content": "i'm after a certain kind of brasilian text face, and i was after some recommendations. i've checked out the very useful wiki [http://typophile.com/wiki/brazil](http://web.archive.org/web/20100827155142/http:/typophile.com/wiki/brazil \"http://typophile.com/wiki/brazil\") and some of the sites listed on it. there's also [http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/brasilfonts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100827155142/http:/cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/brasilfonts.html \"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/brasilfonts.html\") and [http://www.typophile.com/node/13220](http://web.archive.org/web/20100827155142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13220 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/13220\")\n\nbut this post relates to something a little more specific and i was hoping you guys could help me out. here are the details:\n\n--i'm after a brasilian-designed, or failing that s. american face.\n\n--it's for text i'm setting on the brasilian diva elis regina (not for publication--i am setting the text just as a learning excersise). so it could somehow reflect some of the character of brasilian music, or better still, of the fiery singer, known as 'little pepper'.\n\n--specifically, i would like something taut and beziery, with M-formula-type curves; perhaps part of that certain recent trend of south american faces some have termed 'fauve'.

OTF preferably. an extensive range of weights wd be nice, but is rather less important.\n\n--budget is also a consideration, as this is just a personal project, and i've spent all my money on brasilian music:)\n\nmiguel, is your quetzal available? that fits the bill totally!\n\nany suggestions welcome\n\ng\n\nps. congrats guys, by the way, on last night's victory:)\n\n",
