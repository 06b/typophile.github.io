This is NOT a slam - that stuff is printed nice and clean into my memory.   \n   \nFor my two cents, it's missing a bit or two on all the character bottoms. Nicely cleft to the pen, but a little light in the . Hit that and we can spend all day cutting and pasting in Gutenberg text just for the visual kick.   \n   \nMake sense? cos I'm too dr\\*\\*k to post an edited GIF. ;]\n\n"
