As I have seen all lettering has been handrawn, and have based on a San Serif typeface.  \nIt should be easy to find out which one by looking through typefaces designed before 1919 with a similar \"M\" [in клином]and \"C\" [in красных] that were in use around 1919. One should take into account the fact that while being handrawn the letterforms were either condensed or based on a condensed weight of the typeface in question. The closest typefaces that are similar are ITC Johnston (1916) and Gill Condensed (1928-32), also Erbar (1922).\n\n"
