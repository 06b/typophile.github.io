The second one is some kind of robot toy with it's brains showing. This is the idea that they suggested in our first meeting, that they wanted something with a wind-up brain. I have the wind-up key in both version to suggested screwed up or screwed ideas, their show contains very random humour and is relatively extrem, that's also why I have the pink/brown colour scheme.\n\nI'm concerned about the brain on the second one. I think that people might not get that it is a brain.\n\nIf you have any opinions, good or bad, feel free to comment.\n\npeter\n\n",

The second one could benefit from the brain being more divided (left/right brain side). Have a look at some standard brain illustrations to see what i mean.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the final artwork.\n\nSeb\n\n"

It would have been a nice combination.\n\nI've made the brain a little brainer by dividing it in the middle like a real brain is.\n\nI really like the TV, like Seb said it feels stronger. But the brain idea is still pretty funny and quirky so I'm going to try and take it in a direction where I can have both.\n\n"

The logo will also be on the t-shirts and other products when the Shop opens.\n\n_Therese:_ This is what they wanted. The name Pleppo is also very well known among it's target audience and dosen't need that much logo or name branding. There are several commercial campaings going on that promote the site though. The site itself dosen't need to show the name or logo as freaquent as other sites usually do, it's not directly an ordinary company.\n\n_Michael:_ Thanks. It's a pleasure to post projects on this site when you know you'll get some decent feedback.\n\n"
