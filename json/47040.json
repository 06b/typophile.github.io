I had all but given up on MyFonts.com's \"WhatTheFont\" utility, as it almost never seems to get me close to what I'm looking for, even with a good start image... but I tried uploading this cr\\*ppy little \"DUKE2009\" image and it gave me -- as first choice, mind you -- Megahertz In-Italic from T-26!\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/megahertz/in-italic/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023103954/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/megahertz/in-italic/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/megahertz/in-italic/\")\n\nLooks spot-on to me, so I'm buying the family (we're starting a project, can't tell you what it is ;-)\n\nI'm betting I've seen this (or something very close) as a knockoff on the web -- it's far too \"tech\" for the pirates to have left alone.\n\n"
