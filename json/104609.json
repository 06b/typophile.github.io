  "content": "I recently fiddled around with MS Keyboard Layout Creator and was shocked to discover that even the minus key on numeric keypad inputs a hyphen instead of a minus. Now, I use a Croatian keyboard, so I would like to know if that is the case of bad regional keyboard mapping or a general thing even with English and other keyboards. Could you guys check your keyboards and enlighten me?  \nYou can type the numpad minus and the hyphen and compare them, minus should be slightly longer (like I need to tell that to you guys) or you can type the numpad minus in MS Word, select it, go to “Insert \\> Symbol” and the selected symbol should be highlighted.\n\n",

To work properly, they need what they used to get before Unicode. Whatever application you are using, InDesign, Word, Excel, etc, the character that the application receives as input is fixed by the keyboard layout, and the keyboard layout knows nothing of the applications that are running.\n\n"
