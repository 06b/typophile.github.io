      "content": "Joel,\n\nsince the \"plain\" pseudo-quotes are separate characters from the \"typographic\" quotes, separately encoded in Unicode, a transformation from \"plain\" pseudo-quotes to \"typographic\" quotes should be done on the character level, by an application -- not on the glyph level in your font. Note that quotation rules are different for different languages. If your text is in English, then the typographic quotes “are like this” but if your text is in German, then the typographic quotes „are like this“. Each language has its own specifics, and it is up to the application's (or up to the keyboard driver) to take those specifics into account. It would be very inefficient to expect that every OpenType font should carry quotation rules for dozens or even hundreds of languages, and it would be very difficult to maintain/fix/update this kind of information once the font is released. This is why the stuff does not belong in the font.\n\nFontLab Studio uses the AFDKO (Adobe FDK for OpenType) syntax for defining the OpenType Layout features.\n\n**Some pointers for learning the \"OpenType language\"**\n\n- Your starter may be [Leslie Cabarga's \"Learn FontLab Fast\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.fontlab.net/Typographic-Resources/Font-Typography-Books/Learn-FontLab-Fast/) book.\n- Secondly, there is a chapter [FontLab Studio manual](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.fontlab.net/font-editor/fontlab-studio/download-fontlab-studio/).\n- John Hudson's article [Windows Glyphs Processing](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/Glyph%20Processing/intro.mspx) provides a good overview of the OpenType technology.\n- [Typotheque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support/) provides a useful reference of Layout features used by different applications.\n- The [OpenType tag registry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/ttoreg.htm) provides an overview of all registered OpenType Layout features.\n- Microsoft provides an overview of the system support for OpenType Layout features [for Latin, Cyrillic, Greek and other \"standard\" writing systems](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/intro.mspx).\n- [Karsten Luecke](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm) collected his various useful OpenType production notes.\n- Adobe published the [AFDKO source code for the Bickham Script Pro and Minion Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/del.icio.us/adamtwar/opentypedev/) OpenType fonts they published.\n- Adobe's [Christopher Slye](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/slye_lisbon-05.pdf) and [Miguel Sousa](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/atypi_Adventures_in_class_kerning.pdf) published useful slides.\n- There are numerous [threads on Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.google.com/search?q=site%3Atypophile.com+feature+sub) that discuss specific quesions and issues.\n- Finally, the [AFDKO feature file syntax](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html) is the ultimate reference for the language.\n- The [OpenType font format specification](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421054923/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/) is an important reference.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

I'm starter and i just study don't have much money, the money from the works i do on youremin isnt much since the work isn't much and when i got the money i have to buy a lot of stuff.

Generating fonts with those features makes them contradict the current OpenType standard, so I'm puzzled why DTL FontMaster tries to make them. If it really does generate them, it looks like all fonts made with DTL FontMaster so far that carry those features are not compliant with the most recent OpenType specifications 1.25, 1.3 and 1.4.\n\nAdam\n\n"

Yet with standard (bought) open type fonts it works fine. So there must be some flag somewhere in the font that the typesetting program reads to know to do this.
