  "content": "Hello,\n\nThe name is Viviré which in Spanish translates to “I will live”. I can go forever on why that is the name, but to make it short..we started using the name to evoke a sense of passion or attitude in business.\n\nI attached the original logo which was designed by me more than 5 years ago without any reasoning or strategic thinking.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806185547im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_old.gif)\n\nWe want a logo that make us look like leaders in design and strategy.\n\nHere are a few rough concepts. I would like to keep posting reviews on this thread and document the revision process.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806185547im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_vivire.gif)\n\nLet me know what you guys think. Right now we don’t have an established preferance for colors, types, etc.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nEdgardo\n\n [‹ Deseos Hookah Bar logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806185547/http:/typophile.com/node/21468 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Skate Shop Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806185547/http:/typophile.com/node/27313 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Try to make a logo just with typography and maybe try to personalise the type a bit like you have done it in version 2.\n\nGreetings: Steven\n\n(just my opinion)\n\n"

I think the wider v’s are unbalancing the colour of the logo rather than balancing, it starts off light and gets dark as it goes along, the notch of the v image is also quite heavy.  \nTim\n\n"
