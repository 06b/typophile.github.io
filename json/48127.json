  "content": "It's unusual to post something involving music I guess ... or maybe not so much, because everybody knows the role typography have had in the music industry, specially in the vinyl age (for me at least). Fortunately I will not ask for some Britney Spears typo style, but for a Paul McCartney's one: I was just searching for some good song to makes me happy in youtube, and I found it.\n\n[http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=cm2YyVZBL8U&feature=related](http://web.archive.org/web/20140418071146/http:/fr.youtube.com/watch?v=cm2YyVZBL8U&feature=related \"http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=cm2YyVZBL8U&feature=related\")\n\nSomebody knows which is the typography just at the begining? I find it gorgeous, and, yes it's true : it's a classyc type from the 70's in all kind of folk-songwritter's LP, but I don't know its name.\n\nI'm working actually in a library logo ... and I think I got it. :)\n\nIn any case, I hope you enjoy the music. I'm sure you'll do :)\n\n",
