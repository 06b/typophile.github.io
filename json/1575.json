Now Adobe sent me a promo offering the Photoshop upgrade for $169 but I could buy the complete Suite with Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and GoLive for $749. Since I have the most recent versions of all those programs I did the math. Buying the individual upgrades for each program came out to $676 or $73 cheaper than buying the suite.

I think this is a market driven decision by Adobe, and in the end, we don�t get a better product. It just updates more frequently and we shell out to stay current on ALL the applications instead of the ones we need. I also believe I read that once you �upgrade� to the CS suite, you cannot go back to upgrading individual programs. From what I�ve seen in the online data about Illustrator and InDesign, the upgrades will be worthwhile.   \n   \n [http://www.listsearch.com/InDesignTalk.lasso?tab1=search&tab2=todayposts&-session=listsearch\\_indesigntalk:F908B3EB745ED0D89BAE670FC051CAA6](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141027/http:/www.listsearch.com/InDesignTalk.lasso?tab1=search&tab2=todayposts&-session=listsearch_indesigntalk:F908B3EB745ED0D89BAE670FC051CAA6)\n\n"

What little I've seen of the upgrades for InDesign and Illustrator has pretty much convinced me that it's a needed upgrade here.   \n   \nWhat I question is that if I upgrade to the CS suite, am I going to be stuck in a cycle of marginal upgrades at $600-800 a pop. That worries me.   \n   \nIt's more typical here to buy what's needed as the projects arise where I can utilize the new features. Single product upgrades have gone from �$130 to $170 dollars US. Even so, that's more attractive at the moment, to me, than the whole CS Suite, just because of economics.\n\n"

No?   \n   \nSo, what's bugging people is that the all-in-one upgrade to the suite for Photoshop users is a little more expensive than doing individual upgrades, IF you already own all the individual applications? Right?   \n   \nSo, DON'T buy the suite upgrade if you already have all the individual apps! What's the big deal?   \n   \nAlso, remember that not everyone already has all the Adobe apps. For those who use other apps (or no apps) in one or more categories, the suite upgrade from Photoshop looks a lot more attractive.   \n   \nBy the way, there are a couple of things that come in the suite that don't come separately:   \n- Version Cue   \n- several weights of Brioso Pro and Warnock Pro   \n- a Total Training CD (I admit I don't even know what that is!)   \n   \nHowever, one certainly should balance that against the lack of printed manuals (which DO come with the individual apps).   \n   \nIt's understandable that people are unhappy with the \\*relative\\* prices, but I think it's worth noting that these are pretty reasonable rates in \\*absolute\\* terms, or compared to the competition. Look at what Quark does for upgrades....   \n   \nT\n\n"

Personally I'm impressed by whats going on the Adobe camp and looking forward to getting my mitts on CS. Fair enough it won't be my money that buys the upgrade, but if I was starting from scratch, would I buy Quark 6 for �1K a copy, or PS, IL, ID and AC for the same money? Yes, this may eventually give Adobe a monopoly but they've been in that position with PS for years and done a pretty fine job on the upgrades during that time. Photoshop now is not in the situation that Macromedias Fontographer is/was.   \n   \nThis may be off-topic but: how bad must things be for Quark when their user base actually actively dislikes them?\n\n"

What Adobe need to communicate --as well as most type foundries -- is that there are standard typefaces, and imo those should not too expensive, so as to allow the layman a good range of solid classic typefaces instead of working with shareware, and new high-profile typefaces that could be more expensive in order to allow a more individual branding (and of course, custom font for even more exclusive typography). Giving a person who buys, say, Indesign, a solid handful of well-chosen typefaces, some classics, some fancy playful stuff, is way more sensible than not giving them anything at all. It DOES indeed add to the notion that fonts aren't worth much, but I think we have that problem anyway... and it should be worth considering to make some fonts more easily accessible in packages such as CD and some others more exclusive. Some folks will be happy to get, say, a Franklin Gothic on their hands, other already have that and still will shell out money to get the latest DTL fonts :-D.

There's a reasonable argument to be made that it either directly or indirectly depresses the customers' valuation of fonts.   \n   \nOn the other hand, I'll also note that the general trend for Adobe has been to bundle fewer and fewer fonts. Back when I started at Adobe there were individual products that bundled 220-350 fonts EACH. So the current system where you can buy ALL the individual products and only end up with 138 bundled fonts, or 212 if you buy the suite, is a significant improvement.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

The best way to sell fonts is to make the public aware of nice typefaces and their importance, to make buying them as eay as possible, and to make friends out of customers.
