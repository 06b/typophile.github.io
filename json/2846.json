I like the middle one because it feels accessable and you need as much warm and fuzzy as you can generate.   \nIt sounds like they need to focus their business. At one point in my career I worked for a marketing agency that did direct mail for the banking industry. A very focused niche, so business wasn't hard to find. Do they do dishes too\n\n"

      "content": "Tell me about it. The CEO is having difficulty letting go of products and services that he knows the company is capable of providing. Myself, and many others from what I've heard, have encouraged him to focus on one or two of their primary services (preferrably ones that offer the highest ROI) and dedicate all resources to them. Due to his stubborness to let go, I am taking a compromised approach by catagorizing his various products and services into comprehensive divisions. In the future eKnowledge will be marketed as: (1) eKnowledge - systems + information management, (2) eKnowledge - training + education, (3) eKnowledge - rich media marketing + PR, or some similar catagorical divisions. At least that way, their will be added clarity to the customers. I'm working on the proposal now, so hopefully, he'll buy into it.   \n   \nOh yah, back to the critique. I am favoring the altered Georgia logotype also. I didn't want to say anything until I had heard from someone. Considering the broad customer base, I think it is the most universal of the options. The reason I included the Futana type was because I think it lends well to using a byline (reason for including all that gibberish above), which will be a necessity if I am successful in my pitch.   \n   \nThank you for the critique.\n\n"

It's also got a nice unique flavor.   \n   \nThere's something about it that makes my eyes/brain try to see Greek or Cyrillic characters in the word (I speak/ write neither, by the way). I don't know if this matters, or is something others see, but I can't seem to shake it from my head. I think it has to do with the terminals, the curve-terminal combinations that the italic makes and the custom ligatures. Again, this is really here nor there.   \n   \nI also agree with Cristian and Tim about the eK ligature needing tweaking to make it lighter, and Tim about the g's descender and trying a ge ligature. It didn't bother me, but once I caught the connections running through the whole word, the end e seemed left out.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you all for the great feedback. I apologize for not responding with anything of interest yet, but I wanted to acknowledge the helpful critique I've received and provide a brief update.   \n   \nLast Tuesday (1/27) I submitted a proposal to my client using the Georgia concept. The existing logo (as shown in my original post) was proposed as a universal eKnowledge logo to be communicated to investors. Three market specific logos were also submitted, which included the eKnowledge logo, as shown, accompanied by the above mentioned descriptors (from my second post). I believe this is the kind of approach Hrant was alluding to: eKnowledge (static/fixed) and descriptor (dynamic/changing). In addition to having dynamic descriptors, these market specific logos are each assigned a unique color as well. I expect to discuss the project with my client tomorrow (Mon 2/2), at which time I should have an idea of where I'll be taking this.   \n   \nYou have all identified some flaws in the current typeforms, namely, the \"e-K\" ligature and the \"g-e\" relationship that is void of a ligature. Originally, I simply thinned out the stem of the \"K\" to offset its heavy base which is a derivitive of the \"e-K\" lig. Obviously, from the remarks that have been made I didn't quite pull it off. The horizontal line over the \"e\", which I added after creating the logotype contributes to the heaviness also. I'm still uncertain about whether or not to connect the \"g-e\" via ligature. Since my initial sketches, I haven't come up with a way to make it look natural, or rather, indiginous to the original typeface.   \n   \nI don't know how many of you were on board my personal logo critique for [http://www.creativesqueeze.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526120959/http:/www.creativesqueeze.com/), but I shared my personal philosophy or practice of trying my best to maintain the integrity of typeforms when using what I consider to be classics. You might say that I will pursuade an existing typeface to conform to my logotype, but I will not ask it to give up its true identity. Georgia must remain Georgia, even if it is eKnowledge Georgia. There are fonts that I don't have as much respect for and I will treat them more liberally, but Georgia is not one of them. If my client allows me to continue in this direction, I will try my best to work some of your insightful recommendations into the logotype.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

      "content": "Tom:   \n   \nI used \"Mayo\" for the business descriptor type. The \"e-K\" and \"g-e\" have been my nemisis on this logotype. I have sketched out every connection/disconnection I could think of and come full circle. My current resolve (unless someone here inspires something I haven't tried yet) is to leave them as is, but with the applied tweaks: (1) slightly nudged the ending \"e\" to the left, (2) slightly nudged the beginning \"e\" to the left, decreased the base of the \"K\", and slightly nudged the phonetic symbol over the \"e\" to the left, all to lighten the \"e-K\" connection a bit. As for color selections: (1) blue is appropriate for the targeted conservative corporate clients, (2) green is appropriate for conveying education, and (3) the third segment is where I thought I would implement a red, which would be appropriate for eye-catching marketing, but it seemed too hard for PR, so I toned it down to a red/blue (a.k.a. purple). Also, I think purple is a rich (Rich Media Marketing) color.   \n   \nDaniel:   \n   \n\"Rich\" Media Marketing is mouthful in itself, but my client ate it up, as a perfect description for the specific marketing services/products offered�\"media marketing\" isn't specific enough. I abbreviated public relations because of the potential length of the title seemed too long (mouthful). It is a good point you make, but having the advantage of knowing the client and business, I'll say that although PR needs to be included in the title, it is very insignificant compared to the rich media marketing services offered. The targeted clients that might want to take advantage of eKnowledge PR services will definitely know what \"PR\" is an acronym for. Thank you for challenging it though, it helped me confirm why I was doing it.   \n   \nThanks for the help guys.   \n   \nMahalo!   \nScott\n\n"
