Remember that this music sprang from a reverence for the velvets not American blues.\n\nIf you can find a copy of Julian Cope’s Kroutrock Sampler take a look at that. It has lots of covers.\n\n[Yeti](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908172821/http:/www.amazon.com/Yeti-Amon-Duul-II/dp/B0009LNRLE/ref=pd_sim_m_1/105-4287604-9198064) is one of the classics and it is pretty clean.\n\n"
