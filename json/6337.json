      "content": "Chris, your question falls a bit off the 'Type Identification' activity of this forum. Without giving us an idea of the look you want, how do you think we can help? My suggestion is to check out DaFonts, or TypeNow.net and don't limit yourself to things with chalk in the name. What you probably want are simple hand-printed fonts. Put it as white on green or black and it looks like chalk most of the time.   \n   \nOf course there are better things if you want to buy them, depending on the look you want.\n\n"
