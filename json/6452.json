It gets much harder the more abstract the logo gets.   \n   \nDarrel, you aren't really searching for the images, but rather the _name_ of the image. I think there ought to be some rought pattern matching ability out there that would allow a next-generation Google to offer what I described.   \n   \nAnd it's not just images. Imagine a search engine that would allow you to match \"That song that goes, dun-dun-dun-dah...\" Right now, you have to know the artist, or (part of) the title, or understand the lyrics enough to search for those.   \n   \nSorry, I'm drifting off topic ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20141022074440im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
