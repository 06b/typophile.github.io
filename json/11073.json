  "content": "Hi.   \nIm choosing typeface for recent work and found that the style of HTF Gotham / HI Chalet is the right way for me. Gotham Medium and Chalet New-York 1960 are in right weight and form with geometrical feel and look. Im tryin' to find variations of its style and need help of the board.   \n   \nAs i read here ( [http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&sub=special](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018015540/http:/houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&sub=special)) Neue Haas Grotesque have to be close to Chalet, but i cant find any Haas Grotesque from modern typefoundries or maybe it is fully replaced with Helvetica?   \n   \nDoes Akzidenz-Grotesk a good choise in this story?   \nPlease help.   \n   \nVladimir Losinsky   \n   \nps   \nSorry for my English\n\n",
