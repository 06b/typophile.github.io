You can down­load the free Lato Saves Bil­lions font and try it out on your own com­puter. You will see how much more space-​​efficient Lato Saves Bil­lions is, com­pared to other fonts!” Twar­doch con­tin­ued. “Or you can down­load the entire Lato font fam­ily from http://​www​.lato​fonts​.com/ — nine weights with ital­ics, all free!”\n\n",
