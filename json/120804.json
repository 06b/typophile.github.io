  "content": "I upgraded my MacBook Pro to OS X Yosemite last Friday and almost immediately found an it was incompatabile with many of my fonts, no matter which word processing program I used: Pages 5, Pages '09, TextEdit, Nisus, or Mellel.\n\nSome fonts just would not work properly in it.\n\nSo on Monday I went back to using OS X Mavericks.\n\nI fought pretty hard to have the fonts issues solved in Pages 5, and Tim Cook even took note of the issues I raised, but it seems the engineers just don't care about fonts or typography. I give up. I'll stick with Mavericks until the font issues have been solved, which may be never.\n\nIf you have observed any problems with Yosemite, please let me know. I will keep tabs on the issue.\n\n",

As I said, so far so good with fonts - even ScanFont works OK with the compatability pack.\n\n"

It has nothing to do with whether fonts are ‘homemade’ or not. An units per em (upm) other than 1000 is perfectly valid for OpenType fonts. In fact, it can have any value between 16 and 16384. There are a number of fonts from FontFont and Adobe which use 2000 upm.\n\nChanging the upm in FontLab will scale the glyphs and lead to distortions in the outlines. (There was probably a good reason why the type designer needed a higher resolution in the first place.)\n\nI can’t imagine what effect ‘rebuilding the names’ should have on this issue.\n\nApplication updates can’t change this (unless applications switch to their own font rendering engine). It’s clearly a bug in Mac OS X and will probably be fixed in the next system update.\n\n"

Luckily, only a very few FFs actually have 2000 upm, but still, it is something that we hope Apple addresses immediately.\n\nI upgraded about a week ago on my desktop machine and my macbook. So far no issues; FAP, at work, works as usual (with the upgrade they pushed out the same day as Yosemite rolled out); Font Explorer, at home, is running like a charm. Indesign and other CS/CC seem to be functioning perfectly, and I'm not having any issues (other than a number of embed problems with collisions between licensed & bundled versions of Helvetica, which is something that's been plaguing me for several years) in terms of type in our PDF workflow.\n\nIn fact, I'd say that Yosemite sped up the launch, save, print and various operations speeds in the Adobe apps pretty significantly. The only thing that has slowed down is Outlook.\n\nJLT\n\n"
