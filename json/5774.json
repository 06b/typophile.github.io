I plan to go to Vienna for a few days after Prague since I've never been there before, and since it's supposed to be the most beautiful city on Earth. Will anyone else happen to be going that way?

BTW, who told you Vienna was so beautiful? I guess beauty is subjective, and if you like neoclassical stuff it certainly has the most impressive stuff in the world as far as that goes. But on my list there are very many cities (including Salzburg) that are much more beautiful. To me Vienna is very pretty.   \n   \nBTW, I might also hop over to Bratislava - it's very close.

After a 13-hour series of flights and preceding time totaling to over 24 hours without sleep, I landed in Salzburg, checked into my hotel in the early afternoon, then decided to walk around instead of crashing and messing up my sleep schedule for the whole trip.   \n   \nI bumbled and staggered up and down the street and noticed a path up the wooded mountain across the street from my hotel. I got on it and followed it wearily. About forty minutes later I reached the top, where someone had long ago cleverly erected a restaurant and Biergarten. If only all mountains were so equipped!   \n   \nSo yes, so far Salzburg is my favorite city. Second would have to be Munich. Tons of people tell me Vienna is the most beautiful, but also expensive, and Prague has that part beat. But I speak zero Czech, so traveling alone is far less stressful in Vienna. I still have not yet made a firm decision about the Vienna part.\n\n"

First of all, there are very few, if any, such people. When I went to my first ATypI conference in 1998 (to Lyon), I was a very poor student -- I lived in Lyon in a youth hostel. Of course, I was lucky to use the student discount. ATypI conferences are IMO worth saving money for it.   \n   \nWe have now a good deal with Czech Airlines ( [http://www.atypi.org/08\\_Prague/60\\_city/40\\_travel](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825142754/http:/www.atypi.org/08_Prague/60_city/40_travel) ) while for people from European countries -- most railway companies offer some sorts of discounts if you book in advance.   \n   \nBest,   \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "I'll second what Adam has said about ATypI conferences. ATypI grew out of a manufacturer's association, so it has always been more associated with the business side of type than other type clubs and conferences, and this is one of its strengths. And, yes, this means that the conference attracts professionals, but in no way is it limited to professionals. There are always a good number of students in attendance, as well as people who are just starting out in the business.   \n   \nATypI Prague marks the 10th anniversary of Tiro Typeworks. When Ross and I saved our pennies, checked into a dodgy hotel in San Francisco's Chinatown, and attended our first ATypI in 1994, we had not completed our first typeface designs and didn't know anyone. We had an introduction to Dave Farey and Matthew Carter courtesy of Gerald Giampa, and that was it. One of the first people we met at the opening reception was Margaret Richardson, then editor of _U&lc_ and she and other people went out of their way to make us welcome and to introduce us to people like Gerard Unger, Sumner Stone and Petr van Blokland. It is something I remember with gratitude, and I always try to meet some new attendees, particularly type design students, at each conference and make sure that they are made as welcome as Ross and I were in 1994.   \n   \nI really encourage people not to stay away from ATypI because they're worried that it is elitist or only for professionals and experienced designers. Come to Prague, and if you find it hard to get talking to people, come and find me or Adam. We'll be happy to meet you, buy you a drink, and introduce you to some people.\n\n"

Almost all of them are in this because they love type, and very few of their heads have swollen to the point where they're jerks or unapproachable.   \n   \nActually, it's kind of funny; even most people who are relatively sharp-tongued online are mostly pretty mellow in person.   \n   \nSo if you can afford it, and you love type, you should come out.

C�te d'Or, please? :-)   \n   \nThe content of an ATypI conference (except maybe Leipzig) is certainly worth the admission fee - but there is the matter of actually being able to afford it. I think most of us waste more than the equivalent of the fee on junk during the year, so in part it's a matter of self-discipline and planning (not fortes for me...). On the other hand, getting good deals on transport and lodging certainly helps!

The upside is that it's an Art Nouveau hotel across from the Powder Tower and the Castle, and there's two miles of nothing but gorgeous Altstadt between it and the conference venues. So perhaps I will actually _lose_ weight at this ATypI. Is anyone else staying near the Castle?   \n   \nBTW, my last post was a joke that seemed funny at the time. But there was no way to convey the joke-ness of it. Don't walk into a bookstore and say that.   \n   \nIf someone else has a double room you're still interested in splitting, please contact me privately. I'd rather spend more money on specimens and less on hotels.\n\n"
