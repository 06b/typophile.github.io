Also, the bottom of the {a} looks pinched and somewhat out of place among the other letters. The crossbar of {F} is a bit timid.\n\nCheers\n\n"

I tried to match the original as best as I could, with some stylistic changes here and there. As for major changes, A M N no longer have stroke modulation, P T Þ now end at the baseline, and the diagonals on K X k v w x are now uniform.\n\n"
