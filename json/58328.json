      "content": "Can your instructors point you to reference works so you can prepare for the examination? Were any handouts provided? Do you have access to a good design library?\n\nThere are so many different systems to categorize fonts. Take a look at Luc Devroye's extensive overview at  \n [http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/classify.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415211615/http:/cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/classify.html \"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/classify.html\")\n\nIn Switzerland a lot of schools still teach the DIN system or Bosshard's modified version of it. Three books that are often recommended:  \nSchriften erkennen: Sauthoff, Wendt, Willberg (Verlag H. Schmidt)  \nTechnische Grundlagen zur Satzherstellung: Hans-Rudolf Bosshard (Niggli)  \nBuchstaben kommen selten allein: Indra Kupferschmid (Niggli)\n\nIndra Kupferschmid's book contrasts the historical classification (DIN) and the classification according to formal principles (static/dynamic) which Gerrit Noordzij described in detail.\n\n"
