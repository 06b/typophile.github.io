  "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI’m working on a logo revision for a company called “Urgent Career”. Basically they offer a service that entails phone based interviews. I’m attaching their original concept, along with my revised one.\n\nBasically I’m trying to clean things up and simplify the concept. I decided to take the bars (phone signal strength obviously) and titled it to create the arrow—which reinforces the word “URGENT”. “URGENT” is also used for the base of the arrow. I set “CAREER” in black because I really wanted it to stand out. I kept reading their company name as “Urgent Care” and really wanted people to realized the difference.\n\nAnyway, any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nMike\n\nORIGIONAL\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905034812im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/urgentCareerOrig_4416.gif)\n\nREVISED\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905034812im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/urgentCareer_4560.jpg)\n\n [‹ Logotype: Better A?

However, I feel like if I were climbing those stairs, I would fall backwards - which is not something that I’d like for my career.\n\nBut I will say good job getting rid of the reflection and orange/blue color scheme. I really like your new version. It is clean and professional, yet comfortable and approachable, especially on the manilla-envelope-colored background.\n\n"

I agree with everyone else’s comments above for the most part.\n\nMaybe you could keep that same basic arrow shape but make it into a flip-top cell phone. That would make the telephone idea stronger.\n\n"

I am deeply jealous of you.\n\nI think this design works well, although I think that the cell phone bars are not immediately apparent. I would like to see the spacing worked on, however. It seems like the arrow is too close to “URGENT.” Also, I would like to see it in black against a white background.\n\n—  \nNick Hladek\n\n"
