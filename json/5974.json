  "content": "I'm looking to improve my typography skills. I've taken a communication design fundamentals course and have a masters degree in interaction design, but I'm looking for more. Right now I'm designing a lot of content-heavy websites and web applications, so something more in the information design realm (forms, tables, etc., not infographics) would be ideal.   \n   \nAny suggestions? Night classes in SF or down the peninsula would be ideal.\n\n",
