Just playing around there!   \n   \nThere are some tweaks that can be made to these two, for sure. What do you think of the lc y and g, the way they lift above the baseline to keep their compactness?   \n   \nThese are not \"gray\" pixel fonts, although they could easily be adapted. However, I think they look pretty smooth as is, if not on the thin side.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414200100im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22945.gif)\n\n",

The space glyph has been altered 1px in the top version, and 2px in the bottom. At first I was sure I liked the 1px version better. Now I'm not so sure...   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414200100im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22966.gif)\n\n"
