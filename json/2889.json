Yes, Leslie has a nice one called Streamline which is similar, I have a few at the Diner, but I noticed the Sinatra script when the re-release of the Sinatra collection on CD came out a few years back.   \n   \nI do intend at some point to develop a font inspired by this lettering example for the Diner, but I just haven't gotten to it and it's not planned into the next font set release.   \n   \nTo be honest, I would recommend starting with Dragonwick and recreate your own cap letter to get this effect.   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"
