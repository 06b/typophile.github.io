In these cases, the width is sometimes not specified, but left to the compositor to make the best compromises.\n\nI've never seen it specified for a text paragraph, though in odd ways, it can come up. I've set a couple books where each chapter was a single paragraph. Too long for TeX's paragraph optimization routine, or InDesign's, either. What you do is essentially set several \"paragraphs,\" and all but the last one is \"force justified.\"\n\n"
