The only I have in stock that could fit these specifications is [Rama Gothic Expanded](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203803/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic) (Semibold or Bold). There are also:  \n- [Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203803/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-be) but it's not enough bold and following weights (Medium and Bold) have totally different /K, /P and /J designs  \n- [Block Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203803/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr) but /K is off  \n- [Helevetica Condensed Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203803/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica) close but overall design off\n\n"
