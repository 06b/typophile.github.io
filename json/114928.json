For the technical details I'm trying to get some support at stackexchange, so I won't bother you with it, but to make my problem reproducible for other people I need a font with the following properties:\n\n- Available for free, without registration\n- Provides both oldstyle and lining figures\n- Has oldstyle figures as default numerals, so the character called `one` is an oldstyle figure\n\nCalluna Regular fits all these requirements, except it is not available without registration, and that currently holds people back from trying to reproduce my problem, so I wondered if there is a legal way to get another font that fits these requirements. Most fonts installed by default on any computer provide either oldstyle or lining, and if they provide both they have lining as default figures..\n\n",
