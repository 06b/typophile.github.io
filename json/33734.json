Heck even my inkjet did 1200dpi.\n\nHere's my problem:\n\nI've narrowed it down to two models. The HP laserjet 1022 does 1200x1200dpi. BUT . . . the Brother HL-2040 does 2400x600dpi.\n\nWhich is better with respect to producing text that is crisp and on the heavier side - as in, which would do justice to Bembo Book?\n\nBoth are b&w laser printers, and those dpi ratings are for text, as far as I know.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\n",

      "content": "I bought an HP-1022 recently. It was quite a find - no frills, but very affordable and a very small footprint. I did consider some Brother models, but they all seemed cheesy to me, not least because I think symmetrical resolution is important. My only complaint with the HP-1022 is some slight toner scatter towards the bottoms of shapes, visible via a loupe. HP suggested trying different fusing temperatures (easily set via the driver) and even sent me a replacement cartridge, but nothing helped. On the other hand, it's hard to see the scatter with the naked eye.\n\nIn terms of pumping up the color of text rendering, the HP software (at least on Windows) lets you choose a number between 1 and 5 to determine darkness, and it's pretty effective.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the reply, hrant!\n\nI actually bought the LaserJet 1020, but I was thinking about returning it because:\n\nI use an Intel-based Mac, and this little printer is supported by 1) An older HP driver that offers no access to print quality controls, limiting the output to 600 x 600dpi, and 2) An Open-Source CUPS driver which, although allowing access to print controls, prints 600 x 600dpi no matter what I select. This issue with the CUPS driver is confirmed by web sources.\n\nSo I'm basically stuck with a wonderfully compact, reliable (HP), quiet laser printer that is stuck in 600 x 600dpi mode. I compared a page of Underware's Dolly printed with the LJ 1020 to one printed with my Deskjet 5150, which printed it at 1200dpi. Needless to say, my inkjet brought out the warmth of Dolly, and that rich black it is known for. But at 600 x 600 dpi, it basically loses its charm\n\nOther lasers for Mac are either cheap Brother brands that do 2400 x 600 (why the lowewr vertical res?), or Samsung models that do 1200 x 600.\n\nThe only 1200 x 1200 laser from HP that is in my price range is the Laserjet 1022, but that also is stuck at 600 x 600dpi on the Open Source drivers. It does have a Mac driver from HP, but I can't tell whether it just allows basic printing (what I'm stuck with now) or access to advanced functions.\n\nI feel like tearing my hair out.\n\n"

I can just return the unit(s) to Staples and do an exchange each time, just paying the difference. I don't mind the few extra dollars. A laser printer is an investment.\n\nI'm now trying the Brother 2070N, 2400x600dpi, with included Mac drivers. The options in the print menu allow for 300, 600, and 1200dpi (with the 1200 appearing as an \"HQ1200\" option.) Is this 1200 x 1200dpi? Or 1200 x 600? What's the 2400 x 600 all about?\n\nI'm a bit confused here, but in any case, I printed out a sample page set in 10.5 Dolly and the output (at HQ1200) look darker and richer than the previous HP's 600dpi output.\n\nSo for a few dollars more than the HP 1020, I'm getting better results.\n\nBut there is also a Samsung model (ML 3051ND) in a similar price range that does 1200 x1200 (stated on the box), but which is rather large (nay, huge!), though it is also \"mac compatible\" - to what degree I'm not sure.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n"

      "content": "Think about how this stuff works: the paper moves, and the electromagnetized (or whatever) specs of toner are laid down on the paper, line-by-line. So the vertical resolution is a matter of how finely the paper can be moved, and the horizontal resolution is a matter of how finely the toner can be laid down. The former depends on the quality of the paper \"tractor\" mechanics, the latter on the quality of the electronics as well as the granularity of the toner coming out of the cartridge. Since the way any product like this is put together depends on the price point it is meant to end up selling at, an asymmetrical resolution means that it was much cheaper per dpi to produce either horizontal or vertical resolution. A given company might be able to produce finer mechanics and less fine electronics/toner than another company, and/or they value symmetricity of resolution differently.\n\nFor text, the horizontal dimension tends to need more definition, for things like consistent stem weights and equal counters in the \"m\" (especially using fonts with bad/no hinting) but most of all for reduced aliasing in italics. For a printer with finer vertical resolution than horizontal, printing text in landscape format gives better results. BTW, don't assume the higher number is the horizontal, since the marketing people will always get the literature to list the higher number first either way.\n\nAnd a general problem with asymmetrical resolution is that if you print something like a fine grid mesh (especially a skewed one) the texture and color of the vertical vs horizontal lines will be different.\n\nIn short: Oh brother!\n\nhhp\n\n"

For example, we could never use the highly though of -- and expensive -- Xante because some of its internal software took over & we couldn't do a proper grayscale profile for it. Now that only affects work with images, but images are an important part of our business. Drive by the office & make us an offer -- less than 5,000 sheets through it.\n\nAlways remember that what you are after is total resolution, with all elements considered. So,\n\n1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... 1/Rn.\n\nIf one of those R's is low (like the paper), having high resolution in some other element doesn't help the total resolution all that much.\n\nMy real world test is that a .25-point rule often looks good on a laser printer. It flat-out doesn't work for offset printing (Direct-to-Plate at 2400 dpi), at least, with uncoated stocks. A .33-point rule is the smallest you can get away with.\n\n"

The ink from the inkjet at high-quality setting seems to bleed into the paper, producing a kind of thick, perhaps fuzzy output that might not be what was intended by the font's designer.\n\nThe laser's output is just as dark, but seems a bit thinner due to greater sharpness/clarity because toner doesn't bleed into paper.\n\nI'm assuming, then, that for accuracy's sake, we'll want to avoid that \"ink bleed\" that seems to be characteristic of inkjets.

Some laser printers have a 360 by 360 resolution. This way, they can, without rounding, support type with a 1/72\" point, and, like a 300 by 300 printer, also support the 1/60\" unit common to Pica and Elite typewriter fonts.\n\nSome European typewriters, instead of having a character width of 1/10\" or 1/12\", defined character widths in millimeters. And, of course, for printing, they use Didot points, based on the pre-revolutionary French Pied du Roi, which are about 15/14 of the English-speaking world's points.

(I am not sure yet, if the 1200 dpi × 1200 dpi are emulated.)\n\nHowever, they take photos with a microscope:  \n [Samsung ML-4551/letter a (Palatino)/quality mode](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090432/http:/www.druckerchannel.de/cache_bilder/std/textdruck_qualitaetsmodustextdruck_qualitaetsmodus_l12b13.jpg).\n\n[Samsung ML-3051/letter a (Palatino)/quality mode](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090432/http:/www.druckerchannel.de/cache_bilder/std/textdruck_qualitaetsmodustextdruck_qualitaetsmodus_lf8f80.jpg).\n\nAs you can see, the ML-3051 prints cleaner, (probably!) less glossy (an advantage), but thinner (a bit too thin). I have compared the outline of the Palatino a in Photoshop.\n\nThe buy is not a question of precision only, but also a question of taste. For most digitized typefaces, the ML-4551 is maybe better, because in my opinion most of them are too thin! But in case of Mario Feliciano’s Merlo for example the ML-3051 works perfectly fine.\n\nI only have to warn you with regard to the resistance of the Samsung toner against mechanical influences. If you fold and unfold paper, the paper looses the toner in the edge. So, if I have to fold paper, I am using an electric iron and hold it shortly to the edge.\n\nAnd forget the duplex print of the ML-3051. I tuned mine with a kind of carton rail. Now I am able to print duplex very precise, but I need 20 seconds per page. No, not 20 seconds, I need more time. It takes more time than letterpressing now, lol! But nevertheless I am contented.\n\nAnd Samsung has a very bad firmware support. In Germany they send service men to you only for updating firmware, although this could be done by yourself in a few minutes only.\n\nI have heard, that Lexmark’s toner resistance is very good.\n\nHope this was a help!\n\n"

      "content": "There are papers specifically optimized for laser printing and some for ink jet. Others are just generic copy machine paper. If you are interested in producing a quality product yourself, you will need to use quality materials. Both HP an HammerMill make papers which specify their intent to be used on laser printers. I prefer 24lb as a minimum. If you examine the surface of laser papers versus others, you can see something about the sheen and lack of visible texture in them. This must enhance their apparent sharpness compared to inkjets which rely somewhat on absorbsion characteristics. Laser toners are fused with heat on top of the paper rather than be absorbed into the paper fibers as are inks. It makes sense when you think about it. Watch for the sale prices and promos and stock up when you can. [cartucho toner](http://web.archive.org/).\n\n"

      "content": "Since this thread has risen from the ashes, I might mention that in my web searches on this topic, I found that some early Autologic laser printers had a 723 dpi resolution. This shrunk the output just enough so that if the software assumed a 720 dpi resolution, and used the conventional 1/72\" point, the point size would actually be shrunk to 0.01383126... inches, which approximates a real official printer's point of 0.013837 inches.\n\nFurther pursuant to this topic, I've modified [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090432/http:/www.quadibloc.com/other/cnv01.htm) on my web site by adding a table comparing several possible laser printer resolutions in the neighborhood of 1080 dpi, showing how closely these resolutions could approximate both the Didot point and either the standard English printer's point of 0.013837 inches or its nominal 1/72 inch replacement in the computer world.\n\n"
