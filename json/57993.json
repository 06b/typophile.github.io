OS? Browser?)\n\nThomas Phinney answered right away:\n\n<cite>All of those components *can* affect how type is rendered, but only one rendering engine and one anti-aliasing setting will be in play at a time for a given browser. [...] The hinting in the font interacts with the rendering engine and anti-aliasing settings, wherever they may be at the moment.\"</cite>\n\nWhat I'd like to know more about is **how the hinting interacts with the rendering engine and anti-aliasing settings**. If a typeface's hints want to rasterize an outline one way, but the rendering engine wants to lay the same bezier in a different way, which wins? What does the math look like? Are values averaged? Overridden?\n\nBasically: to what rendering concoctions are our web type specs subject?\n\n",

The ‘big’ differences in PS rendering will be affected by font-level hints: standard stem values, blue zones and blue scale.\n\nHowever, despite significant improvements in PS rendering (and the smaller size of CFF fonts), screen typography remains dominated by TrueType fonts. And the diversity of TT rendering models is much greater than that of PS: everything from Apple Quartz rendering completely ignoring all hints to b/w bitmap displays that rely on deep hinting down to the individual pixel level.\n\n"

It is a professional tool. Afterwards you can test the fonts and if you see some strange things you can manually tweak the hints to make the rendering better.\n\n"

The key is in the word \"hints\"... they offer some advice about the dimensions of the font and its glyphs, which the renderer can use to make better decisions. TrueType instructions are cool (and there was a brief time many years ago when I did it \"professionally\"), but as many have observed, it's starting to look like a lot of hard labor for diminishing returns.\n\nEven if one imagines displays becoming more common in higher resolutions, Type 1 (PostScript, CFF, whatever) hints still look useful. Remember, Adobe's initial concern was making type look good on early 300 dpi printers, not screens. Of course, those printers didn't have the benefit of grayscale antialiasing as screens usually do, but still...\n\n"
