  "content": "Hi,\n\nWorking on a website that needs a clear hand-written-style font, easily readable at smaller ( \\< 14pt) sizes. Marker Felt fits the bill, though I'm personally not a fan. I was wondering if anyone could answer the following questions...\n\n1. Marker Felt comes packaged with my OS (OSX), but I can't seem to find any licensing information associated with it, and have found earlier versions available in numerous places for free / donation. Apple don't seem to offer it for sale and neither do any of the major internet font sellers. So how does my use of it stand? Can I use it for free?\n\n2. If anyone has any alternatives to Marker Felt they think I might prefer, I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n",

Problem is that most of the handwritten fonts I've looked at are a little bit too handwritten (I know that probably sounds absurd).\n\n"

You could always try asking them.\n\n"
