(Thanks, Jeeves.)   \n   \nYes, eye is a small circulation journal, but the newspaper that carried the story about Banham was a mass-circulation, daily mainstream paper, The Age, in Melbourne, Australia.   \n   \nI'm sure there are occasional stories in various countries' national media about type design, but they will always be isolated incidents.   \n   \nI was on the front page of the Montreal Gazette and in several other papers across Canada in 2001 when I designed the Richler typeface, and was even interviewed on TV (wearing a tuxedo, actually, Eric, on my way to join the glitterati at the Giller Awards). That was my 15 minutes!\n\n"

Actors give up mere acting, to learn the craft from the maestro, and become puppeteers themselves. The annual puppeteering \"Oscars\" become a huge media event.   \n   \n\"And the award for best typeface goes to...\" (billions around the world are glued to their TVs)\n\n"
