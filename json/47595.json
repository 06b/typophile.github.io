  "content": "Hello Typophiles.\n\nI'm looking for a typeface along the lines of something you might associate with the not so glorious type of The British Empire (British rule in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947).... or as my client refers to it as \"British Raj.\" Something obviously serifed and / or scripted is the direction we are wanting to venture off in.\n\nI've been playing around with Dalliance, and although I do really like the outcome so far, I'd really like to find some other faces to play with.\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emigre/dalliance\\_script\\_ot/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016090359/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emigre/dalliance_script_ot/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emigre/dalliance\\_script\\_ot/\")  \n [http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/dalliance\\_roman\\_ot/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016090359/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/dalliance_roman_ot/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/dalliance\\_roman\\_ot/\")\n\nAs always, suggestions / help is always much appreciated.\n\nOkay.\n\n",
