  "content": "Hi.  \nI have a problem when generating OpenType font in FontLab 4.6 for Windows. After creating outlines and preparing OT features when I generate font it shows me TTF font file icon. As a test I take standard Windows OT font, import in FontLab, make no chages, generate as OT TTF font and the same result - TTF icon insted of “O” OpenType font icon.  \nBut when I generate OTF (PS flavored) file everithing OK with icon.\n\nThanks  \nAkhra\n\n [‹ Cheap/free font editor](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108031231/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17762 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Basic OT errors ... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108031231/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18455 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
