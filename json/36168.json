I've tried to balance the regularity and simplicity of the font with something --- well, I don't think it could be called humanism --- perhaps life, spirit or just warmth.\n\nHave I succeeded?

I've quickly drawn up an alternative \\_a\\_, inspired by your suggestions, and I'd like to know what you think.\n\nEDIT: Once more with attachments:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416145112im_/http:/typophile.com/files/scarange_4948.png)\n\nThank you for your words so far, and I'm looking forward to more.\n\n"

Perhaps they're too large? Maybe my mind would change to see more text typeset in the font.\n\n"
