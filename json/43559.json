  "content": "I'm putting together a proof of concept for a modern illuminated manuscript of the Bible. I have in mind something combining the aesthetic of the beautiful medieval manuscripts with some of the techniques and principles of modern graphic design. I'm looking for both body and title text, but the body text is certainly the trickier one. Specifically, I'd like a serif font that is beautiful and legible, that hints at old English without the illegibility of old English.\n\nIt would also be fantastic if I could find something that has a free version that I could use for proof-of-concept. Any thoughts?\n\n",
