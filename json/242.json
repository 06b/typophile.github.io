Was thinking of going with unicals, somewhere in there, what do you think?   \n   \nhaha - I was wondering if someone was gonna mention the steelplate gothic - was thinking it would be nice for tiny footers & folio.   \n   \nany idea as to what faces you'd think of for a bible would be great\n\n"

A daily lecture?   \n   \nThen: do you want to show \"bible\" as the great   \nheavy words that hurt - or as gentle, convincing   \nwords that can accompany life?   \n   \nFor the both second ways (accompaning and gentle)   \nKurt Weidemann created a font, in the first place   \nespecially for a new print of the bible. First its   \nname should be Biblia. Now its called ITC   \nWeidemann. Its legible and economic.   \n   \nI personally wouldn't take uncials. They evoke much more feelings than \"bible\" for example too old, not relevant for today ...   \nI think in tradition the best forms of holy   \nscriptures were produced, when people worked out   \nthere own time and feeling in fonts.   \nAnd with every font they produced things that have the unique look of \"bible\".   \n   \nAs I'm a protestant pastor (half of my time, in the rest I'm typophile)   \nmaybe I could help with some examples.   \n   \nWhat's the theme of the book?   \n   \nMichael\n\n"

Searching online isin't very helpful in trying to get a sense of the faces - well unless I'm going to order them and wait 2 weeks.   \n   \nI manage to find a copy of the New Testament but its produced by the Canadian Gideons for 1986. Not very bible-y looking. Which is why I'm asking here, hoping a survey of ideas , venues and titles might solve the quintecential bible \"look\" from worldly typophiles.   \n   \nWeidemann sounds familiar - thanks. I guess that is what I'm looking for - I had thought that there were a slew of fonts that must have been created specifically for typesetting bibles.   \n   \nMicheal: the book is a complete listing and viewing of the winners from our areas Advertising and Design Association awards, So cover is important (but I got that done) its black, vertical and horizontal lines reading Advertising and Design....crossed with 2003 Awards\" layed out tiny tiny in the upper right hand corner in white. The book will be perfect bound - the cover resembling leather (but fake, no budget here) the inside pages to be 2 columns I'm thinking with that vertical rule in the gutter. the Left side page on spreads will have an image of the piece - the right side text - 1 major dropcap, first line indents on paras. At least this is what I can drum up so far.   \n   \nI don't think I want medieval - just classic enough. Its going on superwhite Mead silk paper - so I'm not going to fake a traditional bible that technically should be on yellowing pages.   \n   \nI'm searching out those bibles you mentioned - thanks John. Hopefully I can find text pages in google\n\n"

The word of god means labor and work, you are small - what you read is great.   \nYou can read only part by part, lots of numbers separate the text. And passages that should impress you most are printed in bold.   \nA whole different approach is Caflischs bible:   \nTake it and read, without sacred respect. So I can experience itself: the powerful prosa of creation or Job, the music of the psalms, the criminal stories in the old testament, the difficult letters of st.paul, the stories of the gospels.   \nAll that is literature - very good literature.   \nBy this layout I can view myself - apart from my education and the advice of others. The text is readable as a novel - without disturbing numbers and links. Those are set in the margin.

Personally, I think it likely depends on the content for which you are designing: if you were producing a catalogue for hardcore porn videos, then I think it would be blasphemous in that it deliberately associates the imagery of sacred text with the scandalous and profane. Of course, the content of an awards book is still technically profane, but it probably isn't scandalous. Note that I'm using scandalous in its theological sense, i.e. something that encourages sin in others or knowingly creates the opportunity for sin.\n\n"

Maybe even - if it's well designed - it recalls a sense for biblical word as a good side effect.   \nIn the bible itself you can find lists of people, families, soldiers, even lists of payment (and lists of sin and sinners ;-) ) and so on, because the bible (in the old testament) keeps track and memory of people - a sign of care. In this sense I can agree with the bible design - some sign of difference, ironical modification provided. And the last points I think can be seen in thee outter form and the context in which the book appears.   \n   \nOn the other hand: The use of the cross on the cover could - if I think twice - bother me a little. Could it be that religious importance is applied to design and advertising ?\\* I for example don't like books named as \"bible\" if they aren't - excepted if it's clearly ironic - for example I dislike \"The Macintosh Bible\", \"The Windows Bible\" and so on, because the content is not worthy of such high word as \"bible\" and computers shouldnt get that respect.   \nFor me that spot of bothering would immediately disappear, if the text on the cover wouldn't form a cross. With black/white, the position and so on there is enough reference to the bible-look to keep that concept. And there is no problem for me in the design of the inside pages.   \n   \n   \n\\* Perhaps I should say it this way: It is a problem of the direction of sense/meaning. The aping of religious design isn't blasphemic and I don't have any problem/bothering with it (except of sometimes tasteless things you can see). Religion itself and its design should have enough power to stand that and there is no need to be strict. Sometimes even it is good and prophetic to ape forms - for rethinking and changing them. (a sideway thought of me: that black design of bibles for example with the strict white line-cross does'nt show the liveliness of the word inside, see for better the rich and joyful design of old bible manuscripts)   \nBut if - in the other direction - profane things are raised to religious importance that's indeed problematic.\n\n"
