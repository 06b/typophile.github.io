I've been trying to do some research on licensing, and I haven't been to successful, so I've decided the best way may be to simply post a question on a message board...   \n   \nI am trying to create a new corporate logo and was wondering what kind of licensing fees I could expect if using certain fonts or dingbats as part of the logo. If this is possible, would it normally require an ongoing licensing fee or a one-time fee? Does it matter if the logo will be used on products for resale as well?   \n   \nWhat if our logo contained art that used only certain elements from a dingbat, rather than the exact dingbat itself? For example, what if I didn't want to use the dingbat as is but wanted to modify it? Would the fee be the same?   \n   \nI would greatly appreciate any advice or help anyone has to offer. Thanks!\n\n",
