Good or at least acceptable diacritics required, and readable version of digraphs used in Polish (rz, cz, sz), like those in Liza.\n\nMost of the scripts, I have found, use \"z\" with the bottom loop and the script version of the \"r\" (like in Feel Script), which is not always readable in Polish.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421052956im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lavanderia_one_5782.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421052956im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Liza_3506.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421052956im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Feel_6185.png)\n\n",
