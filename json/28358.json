I'm keen on seeing how other designers have handled what is otherwise a very bland combination of letters. Aside from the diagonal in the N, there isn't much to work with!\n\nCan anyone make any suggestions?\n\n",

It's for a B2B company. This probably isn't the right forum for a logo critique, so I'll keep the post to one example only.\n\nI like this design because it: infers the 'i' using positive and negative space; uses some basic optical illusion techniques to bend an otherwise straight line, and the circle itself creates a sense of movement, and therefore drama.\n\nHowever, it makes me think of airliners a bit. :(\n\n\\*\n\nStephen, I am always excited to receive your feedback. Try as I might, however, I can't seem to get my mojo around the specific direction you describe. Regardless, I'd like to thank you for your suggestions.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105243im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo3_6113.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks everyone, for your support. Miss Tiffany, I've taken your feedback and revised the logo a bit. I'm sure you intended something slightly different (e.g. the bell-bottom effect of the bottom-diagonal), but overall, thanks to your direction, the new shape is less graphical, and more typographical.\n\nThe hollow version is just and experiment to marry the negative space of the i with the positive space of the n. Further, really like the idea of the contrasting graphical elements: strong, straight verticals in one color, round, hollow shapes in another color, all married together.\n\nIt may be a bit 'art school', but then what do I know; I never went to art school!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105243im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo8_3519.gif)\n\n"
