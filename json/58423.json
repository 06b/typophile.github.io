  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am in the process of developing a brand for myself. I have already created a logo and have chosen the colors I would like to use, and today I brainstormed business card ideas:\n\nSet a.) [http://i42.tinypic.com/1073qwy.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108183935/http:/i42.tinypic.com/1073qwy.jpg \"http://i42.tinypic.com/1073qwy.jpg\")\n\nSet b.)

I am currently using FF Scala Sans but I am not sure if it is working.\n\n",

Even if the other corner (or corners) were done in the same style, I would still not like it.\n\nRed on black or charcoal is a really nice choice, and overall layout is very likable. But that's IMO and [I might be biased](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108183935/http:/farm4.static.flickr.com/3662/3429473040_8a995a228c.jpg?v=0) .. :-))\n\nThe type is hard to comment on because the images are so tiny. Perhaps try uploading a larger image here (there's an Upload Image button underneath the comment entry box).\n\n"

      "content": "I like the horizontal layout better. The cut corner on the vertical layout makes the logo look like it isn't centered, along with the type that isn't aligned with anything...horizontal works better.\n\nI think both red & black on that charcoal look great.\n\nAs for the typeface, epsilicon is right, its kinda hard to see if this type works.\n\nJeo.\n\n"
