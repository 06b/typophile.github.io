  "content": "I'm looking for a book I borrowed from my last workplace a while back. I'm not really looking for the book, only a reference in the book (the author makes references to a US stencil company or similar) which I'd really like to research for my next project. I think the book was dated around 1950, and was aimed for students on typography.\n\nI've searched amazon and archive.org for the book, but I can't seem to find exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nI have two pictures from two different pages in the book, and I'd love if someone could ID the book or give me some info on the reference I'm after.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105064146im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_0223__6106.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105064146im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_0229__5467.jpg)\n\nChristian\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DSC\\_0223\\_hr.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105064146/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_0223_hr_0.jpg) | 252.81 KB |\n| [DSC\\_0229\\_hr.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105064146/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_0229_hr_0.jpg) | 246.81 KB |\n\n",
