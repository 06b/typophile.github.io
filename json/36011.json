      "content": "I’m not really a fan of caps-on-caps. I think “Gelateria” would read better in either small caps or lower case. Also, you should either cut the ornament, or draw your own. I would just cut it – it does nothing but complicate the logo. It seems awkward and out of place. The type has enough character on its own. Plus, once the ornament is gone, you’ll be able to add more letterspacing to “Gelateria” which I think it desperately needs to be legible at small sizes.\n\nAnother issue with that ornament is the color. You’re having to screen the “·” and “Gelateria” which makes no sense. Those are important enough to deserve solid color at full opacicty. Eliminating the ornament will allow you to do this without compromising anything.\n\n"
