The ID requests below were all posted during June 2009, but never got a response.\n\nIf you can resolve one, post your answer on the respective thread and let us know back here so we can track the results.\n\nHow many can you identify? We’ll (re)start the clock at the date/time of this posting.\n\nReady.. Set..
