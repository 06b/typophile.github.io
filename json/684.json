  "content": "A lot of improvements have been made in version 1.08.002 of DTL FontMaster. New functionality has been added, the stability has been improved and the quality of the interface has been enhanced. An example of this is the use of anti-aliasing in the Font Administration tool. The actual generation of fonts has been made more simple in DTL DataMaster by adding a range of default settings. Besides this a new module has been added: DTL KernMaster, which makes it possible to generate kerning for a complete BE or IK database, including Cyrillic, Greek, Eastern-European, etc. at once.   \n   \nMore information can be found at: [http://www.fontmaster.nl/Blogs/FMNews/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032333/http:/www.fontmaster.nl/Blogs/FMNews/)   \nDemo versions are available at the DTL FontMaster web site: [http://www.fontmaster.nl](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032333/http:/www.fontmaster.nl/)\n\n",
