  "content": "Hi there,\n\nDoes any one have clue on what the headline typefaces are on the 3 samples?\n\nIm working on a Western theme with a modern twist– looking for some really solid headline  \ntypefaces with a modern twist (not overly western serif cliche). Thinking modern Wood Letterpress faces,  \nlike the third sample, with that slightly bleed edge feel. Im wondering if ’Baltic’ has had post treatment.\n\nAny solid contenders out there for Wood Letterpress?\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nAny suggestions most appreciated, cheers\n\nJason\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091120171300im_/http:/typophile.com/files/X_fonts_5724.jpg)\n\n",
