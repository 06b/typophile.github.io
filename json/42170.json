I would like to change  \nmy gutter to 0.1667 in having the text justified with last line aligned left.  \nIt sounds like a mouthfull I know. attached is a screenshot to illustrate my  \nthoughts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310072020im_/http:/typophile.com/files/grid_5899.jpg)\n\n",

Also, you are making two changes at the same time: going from ragged right to justified _and_ increasing the width of the gutter...\n\nWith justified text there is the risk of having rivers of white space (due to unequal wordspaces), but it will give you less lines of text overall.\n\n"
