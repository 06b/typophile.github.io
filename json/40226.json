I would appreciate if someone could tell me which one it really is, just for curiosity's sake.\n\nAnd then there's an Art Deco-like font that looks a bit like most Art Deco typefaces but isn't any of them that I've checked: the header font at the top [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20110818105518/http:/tealight-rookie.livejournal.com/).\n\nThanks for any help! :)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cover03 copy.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20110818105518/http:/typophile.com/files/cover03%20copy.jpg) | 153.57 KB |\n\n",

I designed it in college, in 1984, and it was bought by Chartpak, the dry transfer-lettering people. Where did you get the copy you posted? To my knowledge, it is not a computer font. If it is, I like to know about it.\n\nCan anyone tell me where I can get the computer version?\n\nThanks,\n\nJudy\n\n"
