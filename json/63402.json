I don't know how to decide which to choose.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317195920im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jprussian_3497.JPG)\n  \nI appreciate your feedback on this. I know the color is different from the Latin and Greek set. Should be a tad lighter, I think. Also, it doesn't seem to have the same feel. Any help? Maybe it's the small number of characters with ascenders and descenders? \n"

      "content": "hi James\n\ni like your font very much.  \nas not russian, but native cyrillic reader i think you need more experience with cyrillic handwriting. please give more looks on cyrillic scripts from ukrainian, serbian, belarusian and russian calligraphers, so you will know more about natural forms.\n\nabout this scetch i want you to use more of your delightful thinnest endings, it would work best in descenders of -ц-щ- or connector in -ы-. break this unusual loop in -н-, make more flamable ascender in -б- (it may rather not be similar to -delta-), look for natural shapes for -л-ф-г-ч-. ovals in -в- and -ь- may get endings not to down, but to right, and right stem in -я- need some too. won't try to use your pretty -theta- as cyrillic -т-?\n\ni wish you make a beauty cyrillic,  \nsorry for my english\n\nAndrij\n\n"

      "content": "James,  \nmy english is very poor, so i talk  \nabout these new shapes shortly:  \n-в- is better, but top loop is too small and connection of loops too dark. don’t be afraid to break bottom oval a little, and give your thin connection line to right. this letter may respond to -o- so very thin line to right is ok.  \nsomething similar is with ovals in -ь-ъ-ы-. generally speaking, -ы- is historic ligature, that stay in russian, so you can use oval in it like a prototype for -ь-ъ- (but please make horizontal connection more thiner).\n\n-я- now is too narrow and rotated for me. try to move right leg to the right to wide and fix it to the line?\n\ni like better previous version of -б-, it need only move ascender’s tail up, but round form for ascender is ok\n\n-г- don’t need to start so straight up like your, make this letter more wavelike\n\nupper arc in -ч- can be very plain in scripts, and can correspond to -ъ-\n\ni’d like to see more brave descenders in -ц-щ-, it can look similar to descender of -g- or -y-\n\ni hope this can help\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317195920im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile01_4727.png)\n\n"
