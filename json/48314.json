  "content": "I'm wondering what to do about setting a long list in narrow columns when most of the list items are very short (FedEx), but some are very long (Middle East Studies Center of Portland State University). The list is some 600 items long. Wide columns would be lovely, but even at 8/9.5 Grotesque Light Condensed I haven't the space.\n\nSo far, indenting second lines seems like the best I can do. It's far cleaner than superfluous bullets or first line indents, but I'm not wild about it.\n\nAnyone seen this done well lately?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 16.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825045447/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2016_1.png) | 36.96 KB |\n\n",
