Last thing I know of is his exquisite interpretation of [Jenson](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208063813/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1715.jhtml?id=type-010) from 1996.   \n   \nI just checked Adobe's site. So he did [Warnock](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208063813/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1709.jhtml?id=type-010) and that [Today Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208063813/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/today-sans/) [rip-off](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208063813/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1733.jhtml?id=type-010), some scripts... What else have I been missing out? Most of his work is a bit too slick for my taste though. That's always been my main problem with Zapf too.   \n   \nRemember Picasso, who even in his early realistic paintings added a jarring element because \"perfection is boring\".\n\n"
