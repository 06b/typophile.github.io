Maybe figuring out the skeleton and using a single tool to draw it out before you start finetuning the outlines will be helpful.  \nSecond, I’m having problems recognizing some characters, most notably ’g’ and ’k’.\n\n"

I have tried really hard to align everything.  \nI’m not sure on this point but I am thinking that the illegibility on some letters could also make it unique and more memorable. What do you think? :)\n\n"

      "content": "I don’t know why, but I’m reading the ‘ee’ as ‘ec’, perhaps because they are too different. Also, the ‘c’ at the start of the word ‘check’ is quite large, and looks a little of place (it reads somehow like ‘designCheek’). The ‘d’ also connects with the following ‘e’ at a strange angle. Other than that, I like it!\n\n"
