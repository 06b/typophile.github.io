I will be printing on gold foil and apply over the glass above the door.\n\nI would like to know if any of you has a source of “house number styles” that is organized by the date where the house was built.\n\nI appreciate any information and I will post the progress later.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

There are plenty of display faces for your period, but you may want a type family that can be used in print pieces about these buildings as well as signage.\n\n"
