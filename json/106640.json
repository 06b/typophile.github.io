Single-story \"a\" and \"g\", with unusual slab and monospace-like \"i\" and \"l\".  \nThere are three more posters using it here: [1](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053829/http:/images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123834672/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/01.jpg) [2](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053829/http:/images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123834687/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/01.jpg) [3](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053829/http:/images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123834705/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/01.jpg), where you can find other critical letters such as \"y\", \"M\", \"J\" etc.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Optimo Hermes \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053829/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
