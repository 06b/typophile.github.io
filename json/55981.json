First the logo itself, then the slogan.\n\nDo you see a problem with the slogan \"Live like you mean it\"? I know its been used time and time again by many institutions, but I don't think its a big deal. I think the logotype is very interesting...don't know if I necessarily like it, but interesting. What do you think?\n\nJon E.\n\n",

I guess there are some rough parts of Milwaukee, but other than that…\n\nAs for the logo, it’s too busy. And I have no clue what is going on with that weird flourish on the W.\n\n"

It's like a youthful logo that is meant to appeal to a geriatric audience. And what's with the dot after a (lowercase) slogan ?\n\nIt is however memorable. So one may argue they have achieved one of their rebranding goals.\n\n"

The placement of the tagline seems arbitrary and the content ('live like you mean it') doesn't seem to mesh with most people's idea of Wisconsin - even if it hadn't been used before by others.\n\nThat being said - the colors aren't bad for a mark regarding Wisconsin, just for use in THIS mark regarding Wisconsin.\n\nThis whole thing looks rather rushed to me.\n\n"
