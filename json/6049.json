It doesn't have a answer like \"1 + 1 = 2\" but there's a fuzzy reality there, and if we think objectively and pragmatically, we can help. She's probably looking for trends, not The Answer.   \n   \nLook at the fonts in tipoGrafica #60. As a group, they're turn-of-the-century (I mean this last one) South American. Look at the stuff in FontFont: as a group, they're very European. Look at Emigre: they're highly Californian.   \n   \nIt's somewhat hard to imagine FF Signa for example being designed outside of Northern Europe. Yes, it's not impossible, but the _trend_ is there. Otherwise we wouldn't have differences in culture around the globe. And it would be hard to imagine some of Martinez Meave's fonts being designed outside even _Mexico_, not even the broader Latin America. And then look at Franklin Gothic, then look at Univers.   \n   \nDon't be afraid of tangible -if hazy- variance. To paraphrase Jerome Peignot: let's celebrate our differences.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

And if I try to nail down why Signa looks Northern European, I would probably have to resort to formal descriptions, and maybe that goes against the \"atmospheric\" point of all this? Dunno.   \n   \nFeelings are subjective, unreliable, etc. but they're also _real_. And it makes sense to me that groups of people who share things (like a country) would often express themselves in certain patterns.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

When I was setting type on Berthold equipment, I thought that their Concorde was a very classy face with a European flavor. Any of the Gill family say the London Tube stations and markings. Akzidenz Grotesk and Microgramma are other sans serifs. Clarendon and C. Bold were very common in Switzerland, though it's American in style.
