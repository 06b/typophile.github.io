      "content": "Bj,   \n   \nThis is fun, F-U-N. Some small suggestions:   \n   \n1 - On some glyphs (B,D,F) the black backing   \ntakes the form of a shadow while on others   \n(A,C,E) there is no break in form, creating a 3D   \nshape. I would seek consistency. Personally, I   \nprefer the 3D, because it requires more time and   \nperfection of craft, but perhaps that wasn't the   \ndirection you wanted to go.   \n   \n2 - Is there a version without the shadow?   \n   \n3 - How about adding alternates with enclosed   \ncounters that aren't filled?   \n   \nStephen\n\n"

      "content": "hello Bj, congratilations for this funny typography. I also would like to ask why you have the counter empty on l/c ( ABDOPQR )on your positive version. I think that make few contrast betten the rest of the caracthers ( suggestion ).   \nGood work and welcome with this great idea. Do have more versions or weights?   \nRegards/Ricardo\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the feeback Stephen and Ricardo. Stephen, I like your suggestion to make consistent the shadows on A,C,E. I think I will revise those. Yes, there is a version without the shadows. This originally was named Meek Gothic. The idea was to have a playful font that could never hurt anyone - no angles or points or serifs, just lazy curves. And no dark shadows. But plain, it was TOO MEEK. I changed the name b/c I liked the alliteration of Geek Gothic and the shadows made it no longer meek. I am working on alternates. Because there is only one case, I am filling in with the opposite case (the A, E, etc.) Also, letters that have quirks (the phallic I, the cross J, the one-armed Y) will have 'normal' alternates.   \n   \nI'll also use unfilled counters as alternates, good suggestion Stephen!   \n   \nthank you. I'll post some more stuff later this week.   \n   \n   \nbj harvey\n\n"
