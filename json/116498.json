To make them different enough have an interesting typographic color, but blending in well.\n\nMany font foundries don't do real italics anymore, that way they can commercialize the font sooner.\n\nSo, as I wanted the typeface to 'stand out', I spend more time working on the italics than on the regular versions, which was a first for me! :)\n\n"
