  "content": "More and more foundries include larger character sets with extended language support in their fonts. This is good.  \n(Not all design the \"foreign\" glyphs well, but that is another discussion ;)\n\nBut when promoting their language support I have noticed that many foundries list \"Norwegian (bokmål)\" and \"Norwegian (nynorsk)\" -- and some even also just \"Norwegian\" -- as separate entries in their list of supported languages. This looks just ignorant to a native Norwegian, as both official languages of Norway use the same character set -- they are to be considered more like dialects.\n\nIf you want to bloat your list of supported languages then go ahead and include both, but why not also include \"English, American, Australian, British, Cockney, Ebonics\" etc.? Makes just as much sense...\n\nIf you include the Æ, æ, Ø, ø, Å and å glyphs (and some other standard european diacritics) in your fonts they support \"Norwegian\". Plain and simple. OK?\n\nSo there you have it -- I hope to see some edited \"supported languages\" lists now...  \n;)\n\nRoger\n\n",

It is good information for customers.\n\nBut I doubt such a client you describe will have specified \"Norwegian Bokmål\" and/or \"Norwegian Nynorsk\" in their shopping list. And if they did, they would probably be satisfied to find just \"Norwegian\", right?\n\n@ font foundries:  \nIf you want to attract Norwegian customers: just list support for \"Norwegian\" -- if you separate it into Nynorsk and Bokmål you just present yourself as a faux-knowledgable ignorant. Not trustworthy. (\"If they know that little about our language they probably do not know how to design our glyphs properly\")  \nIf you want to inform international customers needing to set documents in Norwegian: list it as \"Norwegian (bokmål & nynorsk)\" if you must, but keep it as ONE entry! But then you might as well also list \"English (UK, USA, Canadian, Australian)\" -- this makes just as much sense...\n\nIt is mostly about spelling.\n\nThe separation of bokmål and nynorsk is getting out of hand -- no need to spread the confusion outside of Norway ;)\n\nNorwegian is just Norwegian!\n\n"

      "content": "_But then you might as well also list “English (UK, USA, Canadian, Australian)” — this makes just as much sense..._\n\nYou may be up to something there ... :)\n\nI think the term \"language support\" is somewhat misleading, because what really matters are orthographies, not languages.\n\nFor example: In Switzerland people speak German (among other languages), but their orthography is different from the ones used in Germany. The Swiss use no ß. So a font which contains äöü but no ß may be perfectly fine for \"German (Swiss)\" but not \"German (Germany)\". Or if you want to set an old German text which contains the long s, you would have to look out for a font supporting \"German (pre-1901 reform)\" or something like that.\n\nOr take Latin: Regular Latin can be written with the bare ASCII set, but I remember my schoolbooks used to indicate long and short vowels, so there would be a need for \"Latin\" as well as \"Latin (Grammatical)\" support.\n\nThen there are languages which aren't written at all ... and Languages that are written in multiple scripts, e.g. Serbian which uses Latin as well as Cyrillic, making it necessary to differentiate and not just list \"Serbian\" as supported.\n\nYour point about Norwegian is perfectly valid, I just wanted to add some more general considerations.\n\nCheers,  \nJens\n\n"

There is already great enough \"confusion\" about the two official languages of Norway - but this should have nothing to do with typography. It is a linguistic choice and not really a character set choice. Let's keep the distinction for the linguistics.\n\nA writer/translator may list knowledge (and a choice) of both languages - that makes sense. But a type designer/foundry listing support of both languages just appears really unknowledgeable about Norwegian (basically not a good way to promote the design quality of the fonts)...\n\nI am feverishly advocating that we keep this (quite political) distinction away from the type design area. Whichever norwegian language a user choose to write has nothing to do with the character set - both can be written with a font that supports Norwegian.  \nJust as you can write \"color\" and \"colour\" with the same font without specifically listing that it supports \"English (American)\" and \"English (British)\" ;)\n\n"
