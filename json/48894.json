Right now the tops of the diacritical marks are getting hacked off. I’ve been trying various possible settings of the vertical metrics and had no luck. And of course it works fine in Indesign and Textedit…\n\nThe highest point in the font is 978, the lowest is -300, stuff appears to be getting chopped off at around 945. WinAscent is at 1089 and WinDescent at -411, which seems like plenty of padding. How do I get this working?\n\nAnd before anyone asks, yes, I’ve read the relevant HowTo and the FLAB manual.\n\nEdit: Fixed the link problem so it doesn’t go to an old post about Hebrew fonts.\n\n [‹ Can't compile/generate OpenType in FontLab 5.0.0 (WinXP)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006140933/http:/typophile.com/node/39191 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font made on Mac loses kerning on PC ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006140933/http:/typophile.com/node/48930 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
