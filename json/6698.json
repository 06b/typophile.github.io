The numerals look like Poor Richard, but some other letters look like they have other sources. You can find this font using [Fontseek](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125841/http:/www.fontseek.com/), or contact me by e-mail for the site where I found it.   \n   \n ![Hobbyhorse sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125841im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49079.gif)\n\n"

Those, along with other notes on the fonts' sources, may be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125841/http:/home.planet.nl/~voogt053/), compiled by Sander de Voogt � again with Mr. Curtis' blessing.   \n   \nThe ReadMe for Hobbyhorse gives an interesting parentage: _\"The second in a series of �Storybook Fonts,� reminescent of the typefaces found in children�s books around the turn of the twentieth century. This quirky face combines an adaptation of the uppercase letterforms of Poor Richard with an adaptation of the lowercase letterforms of Nuptial Script, backslanted 22�. A spritely, rounded serif has been added to the letterforms, so they rock.\"_\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Mike for the link with the notes and other background info. That is the sort of stuff I like learning about fonts that are not fully original works. I know Nick gives such notes on his commercial fonts, but hadn't found it before on his freeware fonts. I knew that typOasis had Nick's permission (that's where I got my font), and so does [Font Freak](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125841/http:/www.fontfreak.com/authors/nick_curtis.htm), and maybe at leastone other site, but because of the issue about other fonts that might, or might not, be at such sites, I decided I would give a more indirect route to the locations. On reconsidering I think these sites are worth knowing about, so I added the other link I knew about. The site owners have been helpful to me and my Guides, and I think they are responsible in the way they present their collections.\n\n"
