Very hard to say as there's nothing really distinctive to me part of /K diagonal strokes meeting at the vertical and may be the /S shape. Could be a lot of thing from totally made from scratch to customization from a commercial font... Some I like: [Salvo Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/salvo-sans), [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova), [Locator](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/locator), [Adequate](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/adequate), [Co](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/co) (don't ask me why but I would probably start from this one), [Arboria](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeotones/arboria), [Mr eaves](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/mr+eaves), [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/avenir) (/S way off but the rest looks very close), [Europa](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404180620/http:/www.europatype.com/articledetail/17)\n\n"
