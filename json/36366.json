This is normally fine, but for some people it’s not. Reason being, most companies have internal filters that block access to Photo/File hosting sites like Photobucket or Imageshack. It’s annoying and it limits the opportunity for someone to see the images you’re sharing.\n\nAlso, if you link to an external website, this will not guarantee that the image originally linked to will stay that way a day later, a week, a month or even a year later. This cripples that historical benefits of Typophile, which keeps a running log of all the posts on the site. So when a visual reference is corrupted because it was linked to an external website, it could potentially ruin the value of that post rendering it useless.\n\nFor more information on posting files/photos read this : [http://typophile.com/readme](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202195636/http:/typophile.com/readme)\n\n [‹ Type and War](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202195636/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36365 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Found something interesting in a museum in NL ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202195636/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35938 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
