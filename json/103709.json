  "content": "I'll be short: Cern & Cern Display are my choice. I may buy Vaud & Vaud Display as well. Price: The entire Cern family (40 weights) is available for $49 for a limited time. (same price for 40 weights of Vaud family). I intend to buy them instead of Helvetica Neue (just need something helvetica-ish, neutral, familiar, relatively modern looking, a bit unusual, rare etc. for personal use and some occasional website design).\n\nLinks:  \nCern:  \n [https://creativemarket.com/ianlynam/6742-Cern-Cern-Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007091538/https:/creativemarket.com/ianlynam/6742-Cern-Cern-Display \"https://creativemarket.com/ianlynam/6742-Cern-Cern-Display\")\n\nVaud:  \n [https://creativemarket.com/ianlynam/6728-Vaud-Vaud-Display?utm\\_source=cm...](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007091538/https:/creativemarket.com/ianlynam/6728-Vaud-Vaud-Display?utm_source=cmembed&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=6728 \"https://creativemarket.com/ianlynam/6728-Vaud-Vaud-Display?utm\\_source=cmembed&utm\\_medium=link&utm\\_campaign=6728\")  \nor here: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wordshape/vaud/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007091538/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/wordshape/vaud/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wordshape/vaud/\")\n\nI thing they're excellent value for money.
