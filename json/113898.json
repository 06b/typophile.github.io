But we are reprinting this book and I need to know what font this is to recreate the cover.\n\nWe couldn't find it for building the website so we used Harrington: [http://www.haikuwisdom.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713230932/http:/www.haikuwisdom.com/ \"http://www.haikuwisdom.com/\")\n\nBut now we need the font for the second edition of the book. The original publisher is unavailable.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you,  \nDiana aka Bonesai\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713230932im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Capture_4912.PNG)\n\n",
