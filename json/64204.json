We're starting to see a lot more print fonts in use, even for body copy on the web, and the problem is, even if they're hinted, they're not designed to be seen on screen and it shows.\n\nI'd like to know everyone's take. What is the largest problem here? Is it the design of typefaces used on screen? Is it the lack of/improper hinting and/or grid fitting? Or is it the rendering technology in the browsers?\n\nIn reality, I know it's a combination of everything, but I wonder if a strong enough design can hold up in even the harshest of rendering conditions. Georgia and Verdana seem to be able to.\n\nAnd if so, where are all the great screen fonts? Is it just too soon? Or does the economic model need to be set in stone first before type designers dare design a great commercial screen font?\n\n",

This opens up a great challenge for us type designers, and I'm sure we will see many new well designed typefaces for web as the WOFF format feels comfortable enough to encourage the progress. I often feel blessed to be part of these Interesting times we face since the computers changed things around...\n\n"

Or comfort? MSFT spent a bloody fortune on the Cleartype fonts and they \\*do\\* look good. Why didn't Apple do us all a favor and license them from MSFT as they do the other \"web safe\" fonts?  \n(This would have, as a practical matter, speedily \\*doubled\\* the choice of fonts available without resorting to linking with @font-face.)  \nWhy is it - or so we're told - difficult/expensive to create good screen fonts? Where are the tools?  \n(Check out the post on the adobe blog paul d hunt's post has a link to.)  \nAnd with all the hoopla about @font-face, why has a tool like WEFT not been updated since 2003?  \nAnd do the flashified versions of print fonts that get used for headings or photoshopped versions used for background images and buttons look bad?  \nNo. It depends on the way the font is rendered. Why is there no way to specify what kind of rendering you want in the browser without jumping through JavaScript hoops or relying on a plug-in like Flash?  \nAnd why am I going on like this?  \nAnd who is Christian Schwartz? (Any relation to Muslim Weinberg?)  \nLook, ain't no plethora, this was all spelled out years ago in the song, \"Fifty Ways To Gauge Your Gamma\":\n\nDon't sweat about hints, Vince  \nMake a new stem, Clem  \nJust snap to the grid, Sid  \nAnd get yourself free...\n\nSee?\n\n"

Which technology is promising with regard to high resolution screens and when can we expect high resolution screens?\n\nI don’t think, that it is necessary to develop many new fonts for the actual screens. A few more well hinted fonts, designed for the screen would be enough.\n\n(In my opinion the development of fonts families with styles for different sizes is much more important. And more serifed fonts. And finally worthy digital successors of classic typefaces like Garamond or Bembo. [Merlo works perfectly fine in small body text sizes.])\n\n"
