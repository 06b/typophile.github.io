  "content": "Hi have decided to teach myself Fontographer. I have the manual and am working through it slowly! When your image is pasted into the template layer how do I know how the size of the caps and lower case in relation to each other? All my charaters are the same size to begin with, but if I scale in the template layer do I scale them all? How do I know where in the template box to position the character? Yes this is basic, thanks.\n\n",
