  "content": "I’m typesetting a German-language book which – somewhat atypically – uses initial dashes (instead of quotation marks) for direct speech. I’ve been asked to use this system before, typically in translations from Scandinavian languages where this is, I believe, more common. In this case it’s the author’s preference.  \nHere is an example from this current book – the second paragraph is dialogue:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150324002056im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dash_4524.gif)\n\nAdditionally, there are some names, terms and expressions that are typeset in guillemets throughout the book. So far, so good, but now the question has come up _what happens when such a guillemet-quoted expression stands within the dash-led direct speech_:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150324002056im_/http:/typophile.com/files/guil2_6147.gif)\n\nThe editor and the proofreader think that it should be just single guillemets because they’re nested within direct speech. On the other hand, my line of reasoning so far is that the nested ones would only need to be reduced to singles if they’re nested within actual _guillemets_, so that the levels of guillemets don’t get confused. Since we’re not using guillemets for direct speech, this does not apply.  \nIn other words – I think the replacement of double guillemets with single ones is determined by typography (nesting within other quotes), while they think it’s a semantic thing (nesting within direct speech).\n\nPerhaps someone more familiar with this practice can shed some light on the issue? I’d be thankful.\n\n",

There is the “semantic use” of single quotation marks for emphasize or to highlight explanations for things that aren’t quotes. But that case doesn’t really apply here, or does it? I don’t know of any “rules” for such a case. Typesetting guidelines are more about helpful conventions than rules anyway, so just do what you think will be understood most easily by the reader.\n\n"

Fortunately we don’t have any such standalone single quotes in this book.)\n\n"

To my mind, if you're using double ones in the surrounding non-dialogue text, I'd say it's more consistent to stick to one variant, the double, throughout, rather than have double in text and single in dialogue.\n\n"

Thinking as a typesetter, I would prefer em-dashes rather than en-dashes for the dialogue, if possible. But my opinions are very Anglophone; I don't really know how German-speakers perceive these things.\n\n"

Craig’s point on what that means for the visual hierarchy with the guillemets does give me pause though… hmm.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that Frode (or whoever is handling the Monokrom account) has commented on [Twitter](http://web.archive.org/web/20150324002056/https:/twitter.com/monokromfonts/status/345271391819546624) that double guillemets would be commonly used with the dashes in Norwegian (which uses both dashes and guillemets) – so there’s a precedent.\n\nI’ll see the editor today & we’ll have a (presumably final) talk about it :)\n\n"

Changing them to singles also makes them less loud visually (thanks for that, Craig), makes them not feel weird inside direct speech (where most readers will be used to seeing single ones) while still maintaining consistency between quoted and not quoted text (as I wanted it).\n\nErgo, everyone happy, problem solved. Thanks, all!\n\n"
