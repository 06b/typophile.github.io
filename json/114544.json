D, F and L are not rounded on lhs. W is flipped M. C has terminals like S. G has crossbar on inside and vertical spur. K arm and leg are straight lines that meet at lhs vertical stroke. Myfonts and identifont find a number of similars, but no match. Any ideas? Thanks.  \nDon\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Carbon \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317070455/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [UnknownRoundtopInTodaysNewspaper.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317070455/http:/typophile.com/files/UnknownRoundtopInTodaysNewspaper.jpg) | 18.9 KB |\n\n",
