This is my first post here.)\n\nI’ve noticed some books from the 1700s, for example this one,\n\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=sAoPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA3](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907012456/http:/books.google.com/books?id=sAoPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA3 \"http://books.google.com/books?id=sAoPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA3\")\n\nput part of the first word from the next page at the bottom of each page. I’d never seen this before!\n\nUsually to learn more about something I type it into Google and see what pops up but I have no idea what this technique is called.\n\nWhat was this next-word preview for? Something to help people who had trouble turning the page quickly?\n\nThis book also has codes like A2, B etc on the last line of most pages. What was this for? Something help binders put the sheets together? How did it work?\n\n [‹ Font Licensing for Enterprise Software](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907012456/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45289 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [just do your magic...
