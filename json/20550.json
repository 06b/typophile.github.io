I've read up on the fontlab group and on here to see if I could get some more info, but it feels like I've tried everything.\n\nI'm working on a Mac and with Fontlab Studio 5.\n\nI created a font that contains a kern opentype feature and have converted it to a flat table also.\n\nIt's got around 150 kerning pairs and I'm not using class based kerning.\n\nI'd like this font to be as compatible as possible with old and new apps.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

You don't really have to understand all of a font format. Ten yearsa ago, many people were building Type 1 fonts with Fontographer, and I doubt the majority of them were able to explain the difference between a public dictionary and a private dictionary inside of the Type 1 font. It is, of course, an advantage, to understand the technical aspects of the font, but it's not a prerequisite to understand all of that.\n\nA.\n\n"

You may have GPOS \"kern\" feature kerning and not use classes at all, i.e. only use pair positioning. For example, all Microsoft ClearType collection fonts (which are in OpenType TT format rather than OpenType PS, but that's secondary), use GPOS \"kern\" feature kerning but do not use classes.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"
