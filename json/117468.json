  "content": "Hello. This is my first post so please take it easy on me!\n\nI was wondering if it was legal at all to take a font file, export a handful of characters from it and use it on a website? To be clear, I'm talking about commercial fonts like \"Century Gothic\", for example, and by \"use it on a website\", I mean hosting a 5-character font file and distributing it to visitors to the site.\n\nThanks!\n\nPS: Can you recommend any good font editors/creators for Linux? Cheers.\n\n",
