The packaging is subject to some very tight guidelines and we are looking for a face that has a large x-height, is spacially economical but is not a condensed face. Any suggestions are very welcome.\n\n",

It’s sort of saying “I want a condensed typeface, but not one that’s condensed.” Does a client on the committee have a peculiar aversion to the word “condensed?” Perhaps you can clarify.\n\nThat aside, try [News Gothic](http://web.archive.org/).\n\n"

In fact the more paragraph breaks you have the more horizontal economy ends up going to waste.
