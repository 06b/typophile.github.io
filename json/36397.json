  "content": "Hi,\n\nI was looking through W Magazine yesterday, and could’t quite pin the serif font. It looks like Garamond, but isn’t identical to the version I have, which is Adobe Garamond. Does anyone know which version is it – or what it is - if it isn’t Garamond. It looks somewhat more modern than Adobe Garamond. Maybe it’s just the negative kerning?\n\nSee the sample at: [http://www.fredafashion.com/images/press/download/w\\_cover.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202184146/http:/www.fredafashion.com/images/press/download/w_cover.jpg \"http://www.fredafashion.com/images/press/download/w\\_cover.jpg\") or  \n [http://www.skydance.com/movies/flyboys/images/news/David-Ellison-W-Magaz...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202184146/http:/www.skydance.com/movies/flyboys/images/news/David-Ellison-W-Magazine.jpg \"http://www.skydance.com/movies/flyboys/images/news/David-Ellison-W-Magazine.jpg\")\n\n(The sans font is Hubert Joachim’s New Hune found at [http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/NewJune/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202184146/http:/www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/NewJune/ \"http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/NewJune/\") and the serif is custom from Joshua Darden [http://www.joshuadarden.com/custom/behind\\_wmagazine.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202184146/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/custom/behind_wmagazine.php \"http://www.joshuadarden.com/custom/behind\\_wmagazine.php\") )\n\n [‹ (x) Condensed sans, commonly used on T-shirts - Franklin Gothic (customised) {Lari}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202184146/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36398 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Looking for a font similar to SimpleType - various {gang} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202184146/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36382 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
