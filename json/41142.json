Graham has made many fonts for free distribution over the years. He also now sells some of his designs under his latest foundry name: [Typotheticals](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203231635/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/typotheticals/). This doesn’t seem to be in that collection.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
