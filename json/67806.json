Modern No. 7 used to be very common, because that's what Monotype offered with mathematical symbols - and then they offered four-line mathematics for Times Roman.\n\nWhile there are now other faces which have had mathematical symbols provided for them, so that a choice is possible - from the American Mathematical Society, from Microsoft, and so on, as scientific publishing is utilitarian rather than decorative, font choice will tend towards the pedestrian. Baskerville, Caledonia, Century Expanded... dull stuff like that.\n\nOf course, before desktop publishing and laser printing, there were scientific publications banged out on Varitypers (yes, the metal shoe kind) and IBM Executive typewriters, for reasons of speed as well as economy.\n\n"

For instance, italic \"a\" and Greek \"alpha\" are quite distinct. And when a number of characters are close together at different heights, in mathematical formulae, the serifs don't accidentally merge, because the \"pot-hooks\" turn back on the glyph.\n\n"

      "content": "For me, it would be the typeface combinations supported well by TeX. There's good math/symbol support based on Utopia and on Minion, and those are _my_ current favorites as an individual typesetting technical papers. (The four basic weights of Utopia have been made freely available by Adobe, but you'd have to purchase the basic Minion fonts.) This [survey of free math fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20120301010746/http:/www.tug.org/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/free-math-font-survey/survey.html) can give some idea of what's freely available with TeX, but some of those packages may not quite live up to professional standards in all contexts.\n\nI've seen many math texts set in Computer Modern and in Times (off the top of my head). Perhaps also Minion. No others stand out in my memory. I know that before the current generation of open-source math font support, there was commercial support for Times, Palatino, Charter, Helvetica, and Baskerville through [Micropress](http://web.archive.org/web/20120301010746/http:/www.micropress-inc.com/fonts.htm), and I've wondered if that's what some mathematical publishers have used, but I don't really know. Back when there were fewer open-source offerings, I had always wanted to purchase one of those packages, but didn't have the funds as a graduate student.\n\nst\n\n"
