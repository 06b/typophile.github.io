Requires FLS 5.0.2 Mac/Win.)\n\nAlso have a look at Christian Robertson's \"Interpolated Nudge\" [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018070713/http:/betatype.com/node/18). I know people who use both side by side.\n\n"

      "content": "After installing, the first thing to do is assigning keyboard shortcuts to each of the three scripts, this is described on page 1 of the PDF (which is also in the zip'ed folder). In brief: For each of the scripts, first select the script, and then click the shortcut icon and select one of the shortcut places from the shortcut pulldown menu. In future, you'd access scripts only by shortcut. Use of the scripts takes three steps:  \n(1) Select all nodes that should stay where they are. Then click shortcut assigned to \"Select Fixed Nodes\".  \n(2) Select all nodes (like the other pole) that you want to move. Then click shortcut assigned to \"Move Nodes\".  \n(3) In the dialog which pops up, use arrow keys to adjust the nodes you selected as \"Move Nodes\".  \nEverything inbetween the \"fixed nodes\" and \"move nodes\" will be interpolated.  \nThere are a few examples with screenshots for this in the PDF. I think the screenshots tell more than my description here.\n\nThis is the same as FLS's function \"Contour / Interpolate Nodes ...\". There however you need to drag/drop each node individually, while Transformer allows to adjust more than one node at the same time.\n\n(I have some ideas for more automatic bolding/lightening from a single master, but don't have the time to do this in the near future.)\n\n"
