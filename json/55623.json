  "content": "I was wondering: what ideas do you have about a typeface before you begin drawing it? Obviously the basics will be there, sans or serif etc., but how much detail do you go into? Do you know in advance how much contrast you want, what sort of terminals you want, or does most of that come as you work? I know this probably differs for everyone, but I'd be interested to see where the common ground - if any - lies.\n\n",

I have never designed a text face. :)\n\n"

But the brief seldom specifies the actual style of the typeface, so within the constraints of the brief the first thing I start thinking about is the overall look and feel of the type, what a block of text will look like.\n\n"

So, I have this one character, and I start building around it. As I make more characters, I might realize that the weight of the stems has to change. Nothing is set from the beginning and the glyph that started it all might not even make it into the finished design.\n\nI do try to pin down the details as quickly as possible, so as not to have to redraw glyphs too often.\n\n"

I don't turn every logotype I've designed into a typeface, of course.\n\nI'm not talking about creating a wide family of text face overhere, just another silly looking typeface you could find scattered on the internet. Being staggered is really unnecessary. :)\n\n@russelm\n\nThe answer is 'yes' if you're asking to curious peoples like me. :)\n\n"

That said, I do think it's a good thing to have at least a semi-solid concept before starting out – at least basic things like intended use / target point size, serif size/shape (if applicable), basic proportions, and something like the \"feel\" the whole thing should have.  \nBut I'm just starting out designing type, so this process is still very much under construction (and will likely remain so for the years to come ;-) ).\n\n"

I don't think I have anything significant to add to the world of text fonts yet, so for me- the more ambitious project I've undertaken- which may last a year, has mostly been an exorcise undertaken to learn all the parts that need to go into a complete typeface and to try and work out an efficient workflow (hint: not the way I've been working)\n\n"
