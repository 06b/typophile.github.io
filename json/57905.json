They’ve been around since the 60’s and got a bad wrap after a scandal so their new motto is “Proud Past, Promising Future”\n\nThe word Baby is in the name and since daycare is what they’re known for, I’m looking for a typeface to reflect a youthful, growing feel, but not childish. Any suggestions?\n\n",
