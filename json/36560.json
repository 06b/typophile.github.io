  "content": "Hello\n\nIm doing a roman - wedge serif called “Quadratta Serif” for text, not for screen.\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/35021](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202182127/http:/typophile.com/node/35021 \"http://typophile.com/node/35021\")\n\nand Im having problems with the maths signs, so  \ni have a cupple of questions:\n\n- Wich is the best way to test math signs (and numbers), and to know if they work or not?\n\n- If im doing a text type, should i use low case numbers?\n\n- Can math signs be innovative? or at least not boring? I am experimentig this, but i dont want to compromise legibility. I see this signs in romans and they are sans-serif’s like.\n\nThanxs a lot,  \nand hope this will help some other people...\n\nFerch\n\n [‹ Recommend fonts that would compliment Serpentine Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202182127/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36416 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Government and language/design frustrations ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202182127/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36456 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Well, I guess that’s my fault...\n\nIf you haven’t already done so, you may wish to look at [http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/math.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202182127/http:/cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/math.html \"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/math.html\") for some links and advice on math typography. Knuth, in particular, is interesting.\n\nPersonal opinion: Yes, math signs can be innovative and not boring. They just need to be clear in their intent. I personally find many of the older math fonts to be distracting when they don’t have any resemblance to the text typeface. I felt this way before I studied any typography, so I don’t think it’s just because I’m tuned in on typographic specifics now. The Greek letters are a different matter, as I’m not attuned to the needs of the Greek language (once again, my failure to learn other languages).\n\nIn my defense, I live in the middle of a continent where most people speak English, so one major problem has been “which language should I learn?”.\n\nI look forward to watching your work progress.\n\n"

      "content": "This is an interesting issue to me, as I cut my teeth as a proofreader of math and, in fact—as a typesetter—have made math and equations my specialty. So, do you build a math space around the letterform of a math symbol? Or do you leave that to the math software?\n\nCorrect me if I’m wrong, but I’m thinking that you’d build the space into the letterform, as there wil be times when the math sign is simply a part of text, rather than in an equation (the latter typeset more easily from within special math/equation software). Yes?\n\nThank you.\n\n"

      "content": "I completely agree with you; build the space into the letterform. The issue of math being part of the text is precisely what I meant about being annoyed when the math typeface is completely different from the text. I should have articulated that.\n\nHalf the time the baselines are different between the text and the math, which really bugs me as the math collides into the text. Outside of the text an equation is treated more as an illustration, and the differences between text and symbols becomes much less of an issue for me.\n\n"
