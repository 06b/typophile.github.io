When i generate it as a postscript font, i loose the kerning values for the alternate chracters. I am placing these characters in 0172, 0174, 0165, 0169. I am running fontographer on xp proffesional. Does anybody know if postscript does not allow kerning on those character cells?   \nThank you for your help.   \nChuck Borges\n\n",
