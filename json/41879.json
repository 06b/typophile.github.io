To get the project off the ground have found that a version of Simoncini Garamond at 9/9.5 is OK, however have a budget to buy something offering an even better word count.\n\nJust wanted some advice on what other people are using or have experienced in similar situations.  \nHave got it in my head that something like HTF Mercury might be the answer?\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ \"Study determines difference between abstract and concrete jungle\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20081029024021/http:/typophile.com/node/41889 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [House Industries make an arse of themselves (possibly NSFW) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081029024021/http:/typophile.com/node/41739 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Simoncini Garamod is still an essentially “round” face. As a general rule, the rounder the letterforms, the fewer characters per pica you get. You get the character count up by going to smaller setting size, and you retain legibility by having a larger x-height.\n\nOne font that really packs in the characters is Stone Print. It is pretty traditional though, and may not be appropriate for a business/scientific magazine. But so too is Simoncini Garamond. I assume this is an double-column 8-1/2 x 11 \\*magazine\\* & not a single column 6 x 9 \\*journal\\*. Another thing about Stone Print is that is won’t read well when the measure gets over about 24-25 picas.\n\nQuadraat too packs in the characters, due more to it’s large x-heigth.\n\nA slightly condensed font can help a bit — Richard Eckersley, who was fond of narrow books, use to use Minion from the multiple masters, with about a 95% value for character width. Gave him a couple more characters per 25-pica line.\n\nBTW, it is the characters per line rather than the lines per page that really makes a difference with straight text. The resaon is that stories and/or chapters usually begin a fresh page, so the only time you save pages are those few times when, by the luck of the draw, a few lines force another the last page.\n\nAll this changes when you have to fit in images or tables, but not as much as you might think.\n\nI’d go with a slightly condensed font that has a large x-height, so you can set it reasonably small. In passing, while you probably wouldn’t want to use it, Optima can be set very small & still be legible. I didn’t believe it until I saw an encyclopedia Rich Hendel designed that had to really pack in the copy.\n\nOh, another font that might work is Arnhem; much more modern looking & business like than any Garamond. We set <cite>The Encyclopedia of North Carolina</cite> using Arnhem — another Hendel design. While a roundish font, you can set it small & retain readability.\n\nFWIW\n\n"

Greta looks like it will save up to approx 20-25% of text space (compared to the Garamond) + it looks really good as a body copy font. In fact I would recommend the pdf tester on the website as an extremely useful resource as I was able to set a paragraph of actual copy and alter the size and width.\n\nOnce again thanks.  \nTim\n\n"

As for my comments, I hope it doesn’t seem like I was picking on you — I wasn’t. I suppose that I was splitting hairs, as they say — a bad habit I need to keep at bay, for the most part. I don’t claim to know a whole lot about typography either — witness my _faux pas_ with respect to Clearview Text, which Kent pointed out earlier. I don’t see why Clearview Text (no less than 48 weights!) shouldn’t be used for body copy.
