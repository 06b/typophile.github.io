  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nMy academic unit wants to rebrand and as a consequence is working on a new logo. I am a documentary filmmaker and have worked on logo designs in the past but am no expert. before i share my opinions with my colleagues and the graphic artist, I would love your input. Our department offers a BA and MA in communication with concentrations in rhetoric, speech communication, health communication, media studies and production. Thank you so much!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [dept\\_communications\\_tees.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419173211/http:/typophile.com/files/dept_communications_tees.pdf) | 25.91 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "First symbol is more fitting for a photography business (due to crop/frame bracketing). Also the arrow contraption looks forced. Furthermore I'm not sure why arrows meet off-center and why they form a loop. I guess, basically, I'd like to echo James' question - what's the rationale behind the symbol?\n\nSecond symbol is just a knitting machine of some sort, sorry.\n\n"
