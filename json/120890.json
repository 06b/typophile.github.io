[Bella Stencil](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064510/http:/www.face37.com/projects/f37-bella-stencil) F37 might work pretty well too. /R and /Q come definitely closer, switching default /C for alternate and adding (virtually) closing triangles to /A, /M and /N should get you pretty close, possibly even closer than DoublePlusGood.\n\n"
