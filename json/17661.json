You pointing to H&FJ Greenback made me jump to conclusions a bit too fast. You see, we have received quite a few dubious requests in the past , like type on passports, credit cards, currency et al, so we’d rather be safe than sorry.\n\nIt would help if you were a bit more specific and used a more descriptive thread title. “Help ID Font...” is pretty redundant, as that’s all we do around here. :^)\n\nOh, and I _will_ change the subject line again, to allow our type IDers to quickly scan the list of threads in search of requests they might have the answer for.\n\n"
