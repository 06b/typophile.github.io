  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nWe are going to start a new catalogue for a cosmetic/beauty care brand.  \nWe will go on a ligth sans serif, with high x-heigth for the main articles description.  \nThe pages will have some background pictures (usualy ligth colors)- so we need a ligth sans with some \"strength\".  \nWe are considering Koz Gothic for this.  \nDo you guys have some considerations to make? Suggestions and some serif pair? \"Good examples\"?\n\nAntónio FOnseca\n\n",
