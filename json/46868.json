Then I think of New Orleans and what comes to mind is the excitement of the creativity that just seems to flow through every person in this city. This is obvious by the artwork and architecture of the city. One of my favorite places to look at is Sucre, the dessert shop on Magazine street. Just looking at this place from the outside is amazing. It is one of the most unique designs and brands, I believe, to be in this city.I for one thought that it had to be a chain from some foreign city and I was very much mistaken. It actually was conceptualized by someone who has been in the city of New Orleans for a while and I could not believe it. The creativity and uniqueness makes it seem very foreign, unlike the rest of the shops. What makes it even more amazing is the design of the boxes as well as their dessert displays. It is so unique because of the color scheme which is a baby blue color mostly with other soft colors. The overall design of this brand is amazing and that tends to be the case with all things in New Orleans. I mean, I know a lot of people tend to think of drinking and partying but when you are able to view the beauty of the architecture as well as just feel and see the artistic vibe in this city, then you will experience more than just a party.\n\n",

There are a few shops that seem a little out of place that are on magazine, they’re generally the trendy, guido and barbie outfitters. I do like the fact that many of the shops support local art by allowing consignments!\n\n"

Also, to Louie, I am not from here but sometimes I feel like I am and I do love how a lot of the stores support local art also. This city wouldn’t thrive creatively if the people in the city did not embrace it.\n\n"

It is very unique and very different then other large cities in the U.S.  \nI would compare New Orleans to a southern city in Italy where everyone is laid back and it takes one hour just to deposit money in the bank because everyone is hot and working in slow motion. Besides Whole foods do you know most shops on magazine do not open until 10 or 11am? I am an early morning person who tries to get a lot done before work and I get so frustrated that these stores are not open when it is most convenient for me. Instead of hustling to get to work, I see these people strolling with a coffee in their hand to open the stores five minutes late! I disagree with SUCRE being one of the most unique designs in the city. It does stand out because it is different from many of the local store designs but I agree with Nancy that is looks like a lot of store fronts in NY and San Francisco. I am glad such designs are being brought to New Orleans to give that contemporary feeling from other large cities but I do hope the hand lettering, rusty, paint peeling charm never goes away.\n\n"

Everyone seems to be in such a rush but shops on magazine are very laid back and in no hurry at all to open well except for the coffee shops because it seems people in New Orleans can’t have enough coffee. Also, Nancy I found out that the branding was done by the Peter Mayer Group and that the store design was done by two local architects.\n\n"
