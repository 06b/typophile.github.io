I’d say it has some Emigre-quality to it, but I could not recognize it among their fonts.\n\nThanks for any suggestions!\n\n/p\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080913040218im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC06028_5307.JPG)\n\n [‹ Pretty script fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080913040218/http:/typophile.com/node/48478 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help with a font ID ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080913040218/http:/typophile.com/node/48808 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
