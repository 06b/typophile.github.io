Or to be more specific, where there is a \"white space circle\" in between the cross strokes?\n\nHope I am not to vague in explaining what I am after. It's a bit tricky to explain in words.\n\nUpper- or lower case does not mater. Also it does not have to be part of a complete type set, I am only after some inspiration.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
