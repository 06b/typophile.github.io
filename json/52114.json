  "content": "Chinese Writing: What are your top references?\n\nThe reason I ask is I am doing a short essay on comparing and characterizing contextual features in Chinese Arabic and Latin. I feel good about the Latin, and fairly good about the Arabic because i have some reference folk & books etc but in the case of the Chinese I am having a harder time than I would have thought finding a document which however flawed ( what document isn’t? ) is still a reasonable document to reference. BTW what I am interested in finding is a) what models of dividing the strokes dominate, I have seen quite a few different ones or if no model does; and b) and anything that characterizes the alteration of radicals to fit beyond simply showing “how” to do it with a visual example. I am not sure how good a fit with typophile this is, but I have my fingers crossed.\n\nAs a postscript ( oh unintended pun! ouch!! ) If there are any references that somebody that is making a CJK font should know about and you want to post that info as well that would be super peachy! So of my classmates here at Reading are gearing up to do that kind of font.\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ 21st Century Design Movements?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072925/http:/typophile.com/node/51794 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What category would you classify Meta, Scala, and Thesis? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072925/http:/typophile.com/node/52083 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It emphasizes historical evolution of a writing system that has been in continuous use since the Bronze Age and the subject of scholarly study for two millennia; it is not an easy read for the non-specialist. (I keep my copy handy, shelved near “CJKV Information Processing.”)\n\nChinese writing of course is not alphabetic. Nor is it “ideographic,” despite the Unicode Consortium’s unfortunate adoption of that term: a 12th-century survey of 24,235 different characters counts only 7% ideographic forms. The sheer number of characters is a formidable obstacle when it comes to type; Chinese and Koreans may argue for precedence in inventing movable type many centuries ago, but the difficulty of creating large enough fonts was a major factor in delaying serious use of the technology for CJK languages until well into the Industrial Age.\n\nFont size does not go way in the Information Age, and continues to constrain artistic innovation. So does geography: the same writing system covers a host of dialects that have evolved separately so long as to be mutually unintelligible. This is compounded by the relative paucity of sounds compared to other languages, so that meaning leans more heavily on context. It is not uncommon to see Chinese resolving doubts in conversation by “writing” a character with a finger to show what they mean. All in all, tradition weighs very heavily on Chinese writing.\n\nOn the other, Chinese writing is also an ancient art form. Beautiful (brush) writing goes back many, many centuries, with long-established conventions and the artistic freedom to re-interpret and vary from same.\n\nOne area where Opentype-type “context” could count is traditional vs. simplified Chinese, two separate “languages” (or attributes) in computerdom. Anyone well imbued with the both forms will know how hard it can be to unify a given piece of Chinese text to one set or the other: the two overlap not only in the concrete world but also as one reads them. A few recent Opentype fonts implement traditional and simplified characters as alternate forms that InDesign’s glyph palette allows one to swap. I read somewhere that one of the Windows system fonts for Chinese briefly could use a language attribute to select between but I’ve mislaid the reference.\n\nI don’t mean to be as obscurantist as this may sound, but occasionally I recall the closing words in the movie “Chinatown,” where someone explains to Jack Nicholson’s character that some things Chinese defy simple explanation.\n\nGood luck!  \nDavid\n\n"

      "content": "I think the first thing you need to clear is what you mean by “contextual features”. The choices are:\n\n1. Context between print characters within a line.  \n2. Context between strokes and radicals within a print character.  \n3. Context between strokes, radicals or characters in handwritten script.\n\nTo 1: There is basically none. Each character occupies an equal rectangle space (it’s why Chinese is nicknamed the “square script”) and does not interact with neighboring characters. The only contextual variation happens to the spacing of punctuations, and to some punctuations themselves depending on the direction of the text flow (horizontal vs. vertical punctuation).\n\nTo 2: As far as I know, there are no clear-cut rules, and all common-sense rules are derived from calligraphic traditions, see below.\n\nTo 3: Well, Chinese calligraphy is a self-contained discipline of visual art, as complex as any other discipline. Although I’m somewhat familiar with the topic (some in my family are professionals and semi-professionals practicing and/or teaching Chinese typography and its history), I don’t even know where to begin. In any case, I’d say this is something you’re most likely not able to learn in a couple of weeks. And though the same could be said about Latin and Arabic calligraphy, the difference is that there isn’t a Chinese Gutenberg who’s formalized a somewhat authoritative set of rules for Chinese (micro-)typography. I’ve seen one book about Chinese type design (written in Chinese, of course), and it’s basically a collection of a few hundred examples. The whole field is far from being systematically developed (in the scientific sense) yet.\n\n"

We have developed a typeface design, called Kazuraki, which breaks that assumption. (It also broke some Adobe applications in the process. ;-)\n\nEach ideograph (and kana) in Kazuraki is genuinely proportional. Some are wider than they are tall, and vice versa. It depends on the ideograph. The typeface design even includes two- and three-character vertical hiragana ligatures.

Context between strokes, radicals or characters in handwritten script.”\n\nKen Kunde is absolutely right to point out that running hand style produces ligatres and therefore a kind of contextual impact of one glyph on the other. In fact in the ra/no ligature ( hiragana) the one blends into the other completely.\n\nWhat I am after though is PhD or other works that analyse what goes on within a chinese glyph/kanji when a radical has to fit with other strokes. There are many examples of exceptions and even reinventions of shapes but there also seems to be a bit of a pattern especially when the radical is essentially intact.\n\nFor example\n\nIf you take the radical 夕 (evening) and then look at it in 死 (death) you can see the angle become more acute and to preserve clarity all the strokes become less dense. If you look at 多 (frequent) the angle becomes less acute and again there is stroke thinning which I willstop mentioning now. A more extreme axample is 夢 where the angle is flattened even more.\n\nThe reason I picked the first one is that it’s angle makes it’s transformations fairly interesting.\n\nThe example of 日 (sun) is contrasting because it is a boxy shape and also because it is used a great deal - 603 entries in the dictionary I am using just now. It can appear on the side 晤 (clear),曚 darkness; top 昇 (rise up), and the vertical and horizontal compression looks almost like it could be done mechanically even if it can’t be.\n\nThen there is 尸 (flag) which interestingly shrinks just part of itself. A very exteme axample is 屬 ( how is that for dense with strokes? - genus, subordinate official, belong, affiliated)\n\nThen there is 川 (River, stream) which can be found in 順 (which means several things; docility, obey, occasion, order, right, turn) and which is a horizontal squish. But also can be interleaved like this: 州 (province or state) or shot through: 卅 (thirty).\n\nSo that’s the behavior, or some of it, and what I am wondering is if any body recalls work done that describes the systems at work. I mean something beyond “common sense” and is fairly analytical - especially in visual terms.\n\nMy next step is to go trolling in the PhDs and see what that might turn up.\n\n"

We first disclosed it in late 2005, when we held OpenType Developer Day events in Beijing and Seoul. Basically, an element library is developed that is used to construct the glyph. What makes this element library unique is that each element is a multiple master glyph, with up to four design axes. Some simpler elements may have only two design axes. This allows the shapes to contort within a defined scope. Height and width are obvious parameters, but stroke thickness and curvature are others. We also implemented a quasi-fifth axis, for rotation.\n\nBTW, I found the document I was referring to. It is one of the presentations at the OpenType Developer Day in Beijing (11/2005). I will send the PDF to you in a few minutes.\n\nIn terms of the design tool, it is proprietary, and we do not sell or license it. This is mainly due to the extreme nature of its learning curve.

In this style, each character needs to fit into a square—not as extremely as in the Song/Ming typefaces used for print, but certainly a lot more than in cursive styles where the calligrapher is freer to break out of the box (Ken’s sample of Kazuraki beautifully shows how the freer calligraphic styles break out of the confinement of the square).\n\nLearning Chinese calligraphy consisted entirely of slavishly reproducing the characters written by my teacher. I never learned any theory or even how to write other characters without a sample in front of me to imitate. The idea was to copy lots and lots of characters written by masters to get a sense of how to adjust the shape and proportion of the radicals in order to fit each character into a square box.\n\nI have a feeling most Chinese calligraphers achieve this instinctive sense of harmony and proportion of the character components through practice and looking at hundreds of examples, and I doubt they analyze to any detailed extent what they are doing when they shape each character. Type designers might be more systematic (I frankly have no idea), but whatever system they use would be derived from an instinctive sense of proportion, just like calligraphers.\n\nEben, is it true that someone at Reading is gearing up to do a CJK font? He or she would need to find a way to make it doable in a year. I would say that without something like Adobe’s proprietary design tool, selecting a subset of the 100 most frequently used characters will be enough of a challenge to design and implement in a font by one person (who has no prior CJK font design experience) in one year.\n\nOr what about tackling hangul, the Korean alphabet? Although hangul glyphs are built up from components and require a sense for shaping these components as in Chinese characters, it is possible to apply a more modular approach as the variation won’t be as extreme as in Chinese characters. If one is aiming for a more innovative design, one can minimize the variation in the shapes of the individual alphabetic components and break free of the square box. I’ve seen at least one person take that approach to create a free hangul font for Linux. Plus, I may be able to provide design feedback for hangul as a native reader of Korean. In any case, good luck to whoever is willing to take up the CJK challenge and to Eben and all the Reading students.\n\n"

Still, there have been some (rather rudimentary) attempts to scientifically analyze the common aesthetics of Chinese calligraphy, most notably by the later grand master Qi Gong.\n\nHe analyzed a large number of famous calligraphical works and determined that the weight of a character (center of gravity) should ideally fall to the four intersection points which divide the bounding square at the Golden Ratio, and most prominently, the upper left of the four should be the main center of gravity (among others, it means statistically, the density of strokes should be higher around that point than anywhere else) — which, of course, is very much in line with the well known rule of “top denser than bottom, left denser than right, inside denser than outside”.\n\nI don’t know if anyone has tested the Golden Ratio Hypothesis on standard computer fonts, though it’s not very hard to write an algorithm for it: Rasterize a font to a fixed size, then add all characters on top of each other, and look where the “blackest” point is within the square.\n\n"

McDermott’s “A Social History of the Chinese Book” discusses issues such as the value of hand-copies vs. wood-block prints, and consequent influence. He also provides details of the transition between: the artist who wrote out the masters for wood-block pages was necessarily literate, but carvers were not; experienced carvers handled the tricky parts of individual characters, leaving the easier strokes for apprentices. In other words, Chinese “type” was industrialized and formalized centuries before becoming movable on a significant scale. The emphasis on practicality is summed up in Lucille Chia’s title, “Printing for Profit.” Nothing too startling in all this — Gutenberg imitated manuscripts, and market factors have long colored printing in the west.\n\nOne difference is that the act of writing has retained its value in China, Korea and Japan through its traditional association with scholarship. Like my parents before me, I was taught penmanship in elementary school (in the 1950s), but that disappeared long before my children reached school age. It continues in China. One indication of the separation between type and writing-as-art (“calligraphy”) in the Chinese context surfaces in the common criticism of simplified characters, which often borrow short-hand forms from hand-writing that look inelegant re-cast in type. One of the ironies here is that when typing Chinese you no longer have to draw all the strokes — computerized type addresses the challenging aspect of using traditional characters.\n\nI am very impressed by the technical virtuosity of Ken’s examples, but when I want to see beautiful Chinese writing I look to the calligraphy of Zhao Mengfu — centuries old but still very much alive and capturing the moment of its creation. Different strokes for different purposes.\n\nComputers have obviously been a huge boon to Chinese type — one has only to contemplate mechanical Chinese typewriters. The complexity of CJK characters makes screen resolution a big deal, as James noted already. The less-than-ideal quality of computer displays may ultimately be more influential than any other factor in the acceptance of simplified characters outside of the People’s Republic. But although PRC citizens now comprise the single largest group on the internet, the real action may be happening on telephones. Google “chinese text messaging” for an idea of the importance of tiny-screen type: an account from a couple of years ago claimed 1.2 billion text messages per day. How might this effect the course of Chinese writing?\n\n"
