You have to enter ‘Recta’ into the ‘Name’ field, it’s the only hit that has an image. Not much information, though.\n\nThe [pdf on H. Berthold types](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202140119/http:/www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftgiessereien/Berthold/BertholdAG.pdf) by Klingspor Museum confirms that there was a Recta-Kursiv published in 1926 – but it has no sample.  \nF\n\n"
