  "content": "I have been using the Bitstream Clarendon for almost 8 years, and the Adobe version here and there. But lately I haven't been satisfied with either. It is a very useful font, but the numbers in particular are clunky and dark, and the Adobe version is very sterile looking. Is there a better version of Clarendon that is perhaps more expertly drawn and has better stroke contrast, I guess sort of a display version? Are there any alternatives which show improvement to the original design without modernizing it, or is there a version acknowledged to be closest to the original in digital form?\n\n",
