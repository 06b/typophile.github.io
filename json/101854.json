Three variants in this release: Regular, Condensed Bold, and Condensed Bold Italic.\n\nAvailable here:  \n [http://openfontlibrary.org/font/earthbound](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414233010/http:/openfontlibrary.org/font/earthbound)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414233010im_/http:/typophile.com/files/EBfontSample_6716.png)\n\nKinda wondering if it's even condensed enough to call \"Condensed.\"\n\nThanks!\n\n",
