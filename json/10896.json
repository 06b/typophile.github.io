  "content": "It is a script I wrote to create and size object within an illustrator document in the ratio of the golden section.   \nIt will work under os X on a Mac with illustrator and applescript active.   \nprior to running the script you need to install the ScriptingAdditions from Satimage, in their readme file they tell you where to place the additions.   \nInside the script there is different value that will let you modify the polygone shape.   \nEvery time you hit run there is one new polygone created in the sequence.   \n   \n [http://www3.telus.net/~martinga/goldensection.sit](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020153126/http:/www3.telus.net/~martinga/goldensection.sit)   \n   \nHope it will be usefull.   \n   \nMartin\n\n",
