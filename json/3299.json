I came across this face I started back in 1999.   \n   \nDo you think it's worth trying to do something with, or is it a lost cause?   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020202722im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27194.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Jim, this one is definitely not a lost cause, imo.   \nHowever, you might investigate similar faces   \nbefore proceeding. The 'technoish' rounded square shape   \nhas been used quite a bit and is a fairly accessible   \njumping off point to start a typeface.   \n   \nI'd check Identikal, WWFT, and Cape Arcona to start with.   \nMaybe also check with some of your Union Font   \ndesigners ... some of them may have already gone   \ndown this road.   \n   \n   \nSome initial comments:   \n   \nf - perhaps extend the upper arch   \nj - perhaps extend the lower arch   \nk - the upper arm needs some work, imo   \nm - this should not be two 'n's in width   \nor it'll seem too wide.   \nw - see above   \n   \nbest of luck.   \n   \nbj\n\n"
