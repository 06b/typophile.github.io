  "content": "Hi i'm working on a typography assignment for a university paper in New Zealand. The Assignment is \"Use the type from a non-alcoholic beverage and container to design your own perception. The inherent challenge being not to design an endorsement of the beverage, but to express ametaphor or interpretation of it\".   \n   \nThe beverage i have choosen is a fruit juice beverage called Simply Squeezed. Since starting this project i have been made aware of the turth, Simple Squeezed Juice has had preservatives, water, sugar added and the juices is made from concentrate.   \n   \nI was trying to create the feeling that the type is under pressure, being crushed. The reasn i have made the type so hard to read is because the name \"Simply Squeezed\" is misleading when additives are used to make the juice.   \n   \nI have a question to ask:   \nHow would i make the type look under pressure compressed?   \n   \nAny feed back is much appreciated.   \nthanks for your time   \n<!--attachment: Typography_assignment-34833.unk*attachment_icon.gif*image/tiff*456.8*Typography+Assignment+development*Typography+assignment%2etif -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143322im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"image/tiff\">Typography Assignment development<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143322/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Typography_assignment-34833.unk\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Typography assignment.tif</b></a> (456.8 k)</td></tr></table>\n</center>\n<!--/attachment-->\n",

But I don't conflate the designs you have with pressure, instead I see density or volume. It might be because all lines of type appear to be without distortion and are therefore stacked atop one another.\n\n"

Except   \nshe made potato stamps and pressed ink onto paper   \nthen scanned etc. Very organic and appropriate. I would   \nget right away from the screen and think about what   \nyou would have to do to pulp type into a juice. I agree   \nwith Chase, it looks under dense, not particulary squeezed.   \nHave fun!   \n   \nkris.\n\n"

      "content": "Quite a beautiful form you have created. It is more the look of pulp from squeezing rather than feeling squeezed. I think the difference is that you have created a texture by using so many letterforms. You might try using far fewer words to make your point. To show squeezing, you may need to have a visual comparison to anti-squeezing. Maybe the word\"Simple\" is spaced normally and the word \"Squeezed\" uses progressively tightened letterspacing to the point of overlap. The Yin makes the Yang apparent by juxtaposition.   \n   \nChrisL\n\n"
