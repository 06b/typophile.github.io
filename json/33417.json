  "content": "Font Bros is proud to announce the release of two new display fonts by the talented Mark Simonson : [Kinescope](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014115814/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?code=simonson&goto=http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?key%3DMASS-KINE%26preadd%3Daction) and [Snicker](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014115814/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?code=simonson&goto=http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?key%3DMASS-SNIC%26preadd%3Daction). Both fonts were inspired by hand-lettered titles in the old Fleischer Brothers’ animated Superman cartoons from the 1940s.\n\nKinescope uses advanced OpenType magic to choose the most pleasing character shapes as you type and features extended language support. (An application with advanced OpenType support required for the magic stuff.) To find out more, check out the [Kinescope User Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014115814/http:/www.fontbros.com/images/1110/kinescope.pdf) (1.6mb PDF).\n\nAdvanced OpenType support is not required by Snicker, but it has some tricks up its sleeve, including case-sensitive punctuation, automatic fractions, and extended language support. To find out more, check out the [Snicker User Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014115814/http:/www.fontbros.com/images/1110/snicker.pdf) (1.2mb PDF).\n\nFor the first month, Kinescope and Snicker will be available as low as $29 each exclusively from Font Bros.

The only characters I had any models for (from the Superman titles) were the caps and numbers, but it was fun to come up with a lowercase to go with it and not as hard as I would have thought. At some point I could see adding some other weights. It doesn't look bad in text.\n\n"
