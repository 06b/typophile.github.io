However, I have since found Font Lab to be a far more powerful program but one with a steep learning curve. If for no other reason, try out Font Lab for its OpenType support.   \n   \nWith Macromedia continually referring to a Fontographer update as being \"on hold\" I felt I had to move on.   \n   \nI believe Font Lab is still avaialbe to registered users of Fontographer for a significant discount (it was in January when I got mine).   \n   \nI am in the redraw/metrics stage of my first typeface with Font Lab, so I'm still a newbie with it. Others might have more info.\n\n"
