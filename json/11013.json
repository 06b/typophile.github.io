The angled brushed-like ends of strokes, stronger modulation of stroke width, and abscence of annoying ink traps make Cronos the superior of the two in my book, and set it far enough apart to clear it of the above-linked charges.\n\n",

But it does have some telltale signs of _structural_ plagiarism, and it would have been nice if they would just give due credit. That's all.   \n   \n\\> annoying ink traps   \n   \nTodaySans's ink traps are pretty subtle, and this benefits any text face. Looking at a text face at 200 pt is something a _reader_ would never do. Don't believe those who say traps are unnecessary. All the _really_ good designers use them (when needed). Not using them might be economically smart for certain markets (in the same way I think making smallcaps is largely pointless for most users, economically), but never technically so.   \n   \n\\> superior   \n   \nI think in a vacuum Cronos could be seen as superior. Certainly its MM axes make (or used to make) it more versatile. But it is also less pure, and less original - less culturally significant. Which is what people remember.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Cronos reads really well as a text face, owing to its 'humanist' characteristics (!). Cronos is also used for the brochure the publishing courses at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.   \n   \nCronos does work quite well with other Simbach's types. For my slab-serif paper I used Warnock with it. I got the Type Classics for Learning pack while I was still a student. It's terribly good value for some excellent types. A great way for a student to start up a really useful type library.   \n   \nNever thought Todays Sans was the source for Cronos, but now that you've mentioned it, I do see the similarities. Hrant: just how does one measure the 'cultural significance' of a typeface? I think it would probably take years for any type to become 'culturally significant'... Cronos is still pretty young. So Todays Sans is culturally significant you say? Didn't realize that...\n\n"

As Ezra Pound said, in a rare moment of lucidity, 'Civilisation is not a one man job'.   \n   \nI don't think it is possible to describe a typeface as 'culturally significant' if no one is using it.

No?   \n   \nAnd as, from the first day I looked at these two fonts, there is NO relationship between them. I see more relation between Today and Syntax than in Chronos and Today. I see more relationship between Chronos and all other Slimbach typefaces than any others. Just look at the figures structure in Adobe Garamond and Chronos. Same applies with his Minion compared to Chronos.   \n   \nThat it, its a plain Slimbach typeface. Chronos is not a first type attempt from a young guy, it came after already many very good key typefaces. I really don't understand why a guy like Slimbach will lost his time to make a copy of Today, when he have the skills he have. Designing a typeface from scratch for Slimbach is matter of minutes, hours for a quite perfect result (for other eyes, not for him, as any others artists, its why he continue to design typefaces after all), as any master in this art.   \n   \nI clearly see the philosophy of RS on Chronos: How to emulate handriting roots in a Sans, as we can do in a Serif typeface. His answer is Chronos. Handwriting his the key of all (special cases are Adobe Garamond 1989 and Myriad 1992 for good reasons) of his typefaces. Little like Zapf in some aspects, but in different results. I see more influence from Zapf and Schneider and others master calligrapher in Slimbach typefaces than anything else. If the people who kept going stupid accusation such TodayChronos don't understand than basic fact, they really not in position to understand anything in typeface design philosophy, and all the hours, us typeface designers when spend in front of our designs.   \n   \nAs usual, some people seems to close their eyes, stop to built their own analyse and lost their \"bon sens\" in front a of problem. They prefer to listen any stupid BIG words without any senses from people who just have a jealousy problem, as its with Trajan drama or some others typefaces with good reputation.   \n   \nBuilt your own thinking rather than built it from others fake comments without any feelings and open eyes on the typeforms themselves.   \n   \nOr, quickly you finally to put in same basket Slimbach and others with Mr King and others.

Or maybe they needed to mention the closest design to it out there, so that in the future nobody could bring that up to invalidate the patent? I guess that's what happens when a patent officer has an average of 90 minutes to approve a patent (and his outfit makes more money by approving a patent than not). Not that they have the necessary typographic insight anyway... BTW, what does \"ornamental design\" mean?! Lastly, what exactly happens 14 years after 1997/8?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
