It was clear that most of the contributors to the debate, though passionate in their views, had not seen my film. This is simply to report that while the documentary has yet to get a TV airing in the States or Canada, the film is now available on DVD at:\n\n[http://www.sussex-southdowns-guide.com/Looking-for-Mr-Gill.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080411234042/http:/www.sussex-southdowns-guide.com/Looking-for-Mr-Gill.html \"http://www.sussex-southdowns-guide.com/Looking-for-Mr-Gill.html\")\n\nI would be happy to hear from any of your contributors who wish to know more about the background to the film and my home village (not a town) of Ditchling, East Sussex.\n\nWith thanks,\n\nLuke\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the film was screened at last years ATYPI in Brighton and will be screened again at the upcoming BerlinTypo in May.\n\n"
