My interest in this stemmed from some recent reading/thinking about colour theory and how different palettes and overall tones create vastly different moods and meanings.\n\nIt seems obvious to me that this would apply equally to type. I realize that this is an incredibly subjective and often intuitive thing, but surely there are some broad issues or even more specific research by individuals into this?\n\nThere are a million resources out there that talk about colour in this way, but I am having a tough time finding the right way to seek out similar resources with regards to type. So far, any search terms I’ve tried haven’t brought up the right kinds of information for which I’m searching.\n\nSo... all you Typophiles out there... what can you recommend?\n\nMany thanks!\n\n [‹ OSX 10.5 FontExplorer X WYSIWYG list view](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709010707/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41307 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Again and again the problem of upload PDF files! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709010707/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41290 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
