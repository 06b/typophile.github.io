Unfortenately this causes my Mac to hang during the startup process and forces me to start up in Safe Mode, remove the AutoLoad from the Login items and start up in normal mode again.  \nEven thought I disabled all auto-activation functionality in FontExplorer X's preferences the damned thing keeps showing up.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nBest,  \nArtur\n\n",
