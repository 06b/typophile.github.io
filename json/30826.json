  "content": "hello everyone,\n\ni’m currently working on an art catalog and i’m thinking about a historically inspired look of the typography. the art performance deals with an incident that took place in the early 19th century (1816 to be precise).  \nalthough there is really no need for absolute historical correctness in the final design, i’d like to have a base for the choice of a possible typeface and the kind of layout and typesetting. at the end, i’ll have to decide, whether it’s possible to combine the rather wild and kind of “trash chic” performance with a historical typesetting.\n\nthe country involved in the incident was basically france. on the other hand, one could also imagine to have another country’s press reporting about it. unfortunately, i’m quite unsure about what actually typography looked like in countries like france, england, netherlands and germany at the mentioned point in time. it meets the almost late period of classicism in typography/typedesign. in germany, i guess, broken letters were ruling most of the printed work (what about books/novels?). but before posting more inadequately simplified consderations about the typogaphic state of affairs in the other countries – like france=didot, italy=bodoni etc), i’d like to hear some opinions from the experts here.  \nonce again, my basic question is: which typefaces where used commonly in a) books and b) newspapers or reports around 1816?\n\nkind regards,\n\nalex\n\n [‹ typhographic Q](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112201042/http:/typophile.com/node/30930 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [americana + sans. what to choose? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112201042/http:/typophile.com/node/30893 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Well, I can chime in here that Friedrich Neugebauer was in an English prison camp in Egypt for a good part of WWII and used toothpaste — I’ve seen and held the original. Of course, the formulation of the toothpaste in 1943 may not have _any_ resemblance to the formulation of today’s.\n\nFriedrich was conscripted into the Austrian army after Hitler’s Anschluss in 1938 and as he put it, after four years of serving in the army against his wishes, he had the great fortune of being captured and was able to spend the rest of war (1944-1947) not shooting at anyone. They lived in tents in a camp somewhere near the Mediterranean, where the Brits were generally humane to the prisoners. (Although 55 years later it still brought tears to his eyes as he recalled that some of the camp personnel simplistically lumped all prisoners together: “Give a table knife to a Kraut and he’ll turn it into a machine gun!”)\n\nThe authorities allowed him to make artwork using letter paper donated by a sympathetic officer, colors made from pigments that he ground himself from foraged minerals and other raw materials, and brushes made from his tentmates’ hair. The cover of a small book of traditional songs has the title lettered in toothpaste, and if I remember this accurately, the binding cloth is a flour sack scrounged from the camp kitchen. I just looked in both of my books, _Schrift als Kunst_ and _The Mystic Art of Written Forms,_ to see if I could upload a picture, but a there isn’t a photo of this cover. However, I’ve made a shot of an interior page. (Sorry that the lighting is not good, I just did a quickie handheld.) This book is 30 x 22 cm, and I’m still stunned by the grace and beauty of it, when you consider the circumstances under which it was made.\n\nI can tell you from memory that the toothpaste is quite mounded up — higher in profile than the typical raised gesso with gold leaf on top, if that helps you imagine it — and he must have made it even higher to begin with, since the toothpaste _must_ have some loss of volume as the moisture departs the ribbon.\n\nI wonder if loading toothpaste into a cake decorator’s piping bag would be a help to you, since you would have a choice of nozzle tips, and far more control over the material than if you simply squeeze a plastic tube.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112201042im_/http:/typophile.com/files/prisoncamp_6562.jpg)\n\n"
