I am doing a research on the design movement, from 1890s till present.\n\nThere are 7 major design styles/movements in history from 1890 to today. They are:  \n1. Victorian Era  \n2. Art Nouveau Style  \n3. Modern Movement  \n4. Fifties’ American Kitsch  \n5. Post-modern Rebellion  \n6. The Contemporary Look  \n7. The Digital Age\n\nNow, I am concentrating on the digital age. Is there any articles about this movement’s influences, introductions, or maybe typography in the digital age?\n\n [‹ Dissertation question\\* A comparison between the Graphic Design used during ww1/2 and that of modern conflicts e.g The Iraq War.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019225933/http:/typophile.com/node/50523 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Blender Pro and Flama ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019225933/http:/typophile.com/node/50514 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
