Its based on his first edition which was written in 1965 so not sure how it deals with present day production techniques. One similar to this is Adrian Wilson's book.   \nThe Hochuli book is a great one to own as its a lovely book in itself and a good introduction to various aspects of book design: different kinds of books, parts of a book...   \n   \nThere's also:   \nFive Hundred Years of Book Design: Alan Bartram   \n   \nMethods of Book Design: Hugh Williamson   \n   \nNotes on Book Design: Derek Birdsall\n\n"
