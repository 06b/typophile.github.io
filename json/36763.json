You can see the old logo (not really a logo at all) [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041745/http:/www.cleavedesign.com/).\n\nThought about playing off of the word \"Cleave\" and went with an image of a cleaver.\n\nIs it too cheesy? Does it work? Does the tagline help? Thoughts?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041745im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Cleaver-Design_5325.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Although the connotations are a bit strange to me (the name), I feel like you could do something much more memorable / original with your look than big type + a weapon... knife... thingy?\n\nFew things... in my modest opinion and experience:\n\n1. Looking at your mark, I would lose the blade knife thing, and stick with the diminishing line and the cleave mark through it... having the knife seems redundant and a bit blunt for any viewer with some intelligence... also really focuses too much on the negative connotation in my opinion.\n\n2. I would lose the combination \"g + n\" in Design –&nbsp;or is there meaning there? Was the \"n\" cleaved? (cloven?), if you are aiming for something like that, perhaps a pure type solution could be found that does it in a more intelligent way, and would also make the mark unecessary?\n\nGood luck! bm\n\n"

If you like the knife, how about showing less of it (more the handle sticking out from the cut \"page\" with the blade beneath)?\n\n"

You might be able to incorporate the \"clean-cut\" idea in the company name like Scott mentioned and maybe it's not a a tear, but a clean cut through the words horizontally starting small and increasing as it goes through the whole word. I would also agree in not combining the 'g' and the 'n' unless you have a reason for it. I like your color choice.\n\n"
