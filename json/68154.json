  "content": "I've designed a logo which uses House Girard, but due to their ridiculous EULA I can't even dream up to money to pay for it. It's a perfect script font but still remains ledgible. The main thing is the S looks like an S and the r looks like an r without loops and frills but still has an elegant quality to it. I have searched through so many script fonts and not come up with anything of a similar quality.\n\nANY suggestions are welcome.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [super.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424013055/http:/typophile.com/files/super.png) | 174.28 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Interestingly, I thought the Girard Script 'r' looks like a 'v', at least when it's by itself, but I agree the script easy to read and the way it partially connects is nicely done. Their OpenType ligatures are usually well-implemented.\n\nIf you are still considering alternatives I like a couple of Victor De Castro's handwritten fonts: [Hudson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424013055/http:/www.unifonts.com/h_family/hudsonfam.htm), [Hudson Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424013055/http:/www.unifonts.com/h_family/hudsonserifam.htm) and [Arturis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424013055/http:/www.unifonts.com/a_family/arturisfam.htm). One thing I like about these is they are not often seen (where House fonts can become trendy, like Neutraface and Chalet) and they seem to blend a casual quality with a professional lettering skill, not always an easy balance to find. I use Arturis and Hudson Serif a lot myself.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
