  "content": "Hello, again.\n\nI’ve got two seemingly simple ones here. The first, seen here as the white episode description text - should be really simple. I was told it was Futura, but I checked and it doesn’t seem to be as the “s” and capital “G” are different at least. Please can someone set me straight with this easy one?\n\nAlso, the blue episode titles: I’ve seen that font before. For the life of me however, I cannot find any fonts on my computer with that type of capital “E”. I’m sure someone knows what it is though.\n\nThanks in advance for your help, gurus. :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423212931im_/http:/typophile.com/files/simple_huh_4689.jpg)\n\n [‹ Roman-ish italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423212931/http:/typophile.com/node/44386 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font ID for word vanilla, Thanks ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423212931/http:/typophile.com/node/44381 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

A friend wants a cover that will match up with the retail covers for all the season releases.\n\nThanks for identifying these for me so quickly! I’ll be able to get this done now. :D\n\nInteresting shirt there. Truly geeky to mix sci-fi, typeface names and put the result on a shirt. :)\n\n"
