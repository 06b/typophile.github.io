  "content": "Hello everybody.\n\nAs beeing a student in Graphic Design, one of my teachers gave me the \"Haas Unica\" typeface to study, but i can't really find a lot of informations about it. I've only found the promotionnal publication from the 80's on flickr and that it has been used in a stadium in Berlin.\n\nI would like to know a bit more about it, like what is exactly the Team 77, why did they worked together on that 'Haas Unica\" typeface, what are they working on now, if they're still working together and in which context has been used that \"lost\" typeface...\n\nThanks,\n\nAlex\n\n",
