Even Journal is quite goofy, and it is the one Emigre face I like a lot. Apparently, if you can't draw or punchcut a typeface, letterpress technology will just show you for what you are.

Doesn’t it depend too much on personal preferences?</cite>\n\nIt’s usually a personal thing, but in some cases fonts are just bad from practical or functional standpoints. Arial is a bad font because it tries to be a Helvetica knockoff, but inconsistently blends features of Helvetica and MT Grot to create something truly ugly. Comic sans fails because it doesn’t actually look like comic book lettering.\n\nOf course, this sort of reasoning can break down pretty quickly. For example, many of the Emigre fonts often fail at being useful outside the context of Emigre, or even being legible at all. But they did succeed at creating a dialog about type and type design that had a huge impact on design and has survived the magazine itself, so they succeeded conceptually as a catalyst for furthering creativity.\n\n"
