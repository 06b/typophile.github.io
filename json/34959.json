      "content": "IF the “o” was turned red to indicate an open contour when you first generated the font, and you have corrected the problem, you will have to manually change the red indicator by selecting the glyph and choosing “Mark” from the contextual menu (right click or control click on a mac with a one button mouse) and selecting “None” from that menu.\n\nThe red indicator can also mean an incorrect Unicode assignment, but that red warning looks different than the one in your example.\n\nSlash and backslash always have to be typed twice, since typing them once is a prelude to other actions in FontLab.\n\nJames\n\n"

In the Metrics Panel you can check that each left & right sidebearing is -5.  \nIt may be that in some apps still a white line appears on screen, but in print it should be ok.\n\n"

The amount of 70 units will allow for at least the width of the character to be maintained during the rasterization process at all PPEM sizes.”\n\nref: [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/CursiveScriptGuidelines.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907152145/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/CursiveScriptGuidelines.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/CursiveScriptGuidelines.mspx\")\n\nBest regards,  \nAtif\n\n"
