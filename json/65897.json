These brush capitals are very similar to the [Sin City](http://web.archive.org/web/20100108184734/http:/www.impawards.com/2005/sin_city_ver9.html) logo, originally designed by Frank Miller’s brother. This could be a fan font, but I hope it’s a quality design.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100108184734im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lucky-luke_unknown_5059.jpg)\n\n",

He lived in France for a few years before I was born and built up quite a collection of Asterix comics. Tintin too. And yes, I can’t believe how well they were translated into English. The names – Getafix, Unhygenix, Fulliautomatix, Vitalstatistix, etc, etc – are particularly memorable.\n\nRiccardo, so they have. The TV show was shown here in Australia many years ago (I remember the theme: Bang, bang a Luke-y Luke!), but I’ve never heard of any of the films.\n\n"
