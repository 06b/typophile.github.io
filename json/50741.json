I’m trying to do something 70s-ish, with a modern feel. I guess Bello by Underware is somewhat similar to my goal. It’s not good yet, I know. This is my first go at a handwritten script ever. If you have a minute, please give your opinion.\n\n [‹ Luxury Brand typographic Logo / Please comment](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203347/http:/typophile.com/node/50492 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help me please! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203347/http:/typophile.com/node/50726 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

To be honest, I could absolutely not read it until I read your explanation, and even knowing what letters are supposed to be there, it’s really hard. I see FJa, or maybe FSa or FHl or FHe, but mostly just a nice scripty “thing” (sorry). The d is not a d, and the u looks like it wants to be an a or maybe an o or a couple of e’s or something.\n\nAlso, have you checked if an “Fdu” (instead of “FDU”) treatment may be confusing?\n\nFWIW, your letters reminded me just a bit of [Pivo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203347/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-72-pivo) – might be worth checking out.\n\n"
