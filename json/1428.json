It was in line with their hardware, and still simple enough to accommodate the different colors (for cases and product lines).   \n   \nI think apple strove and continues to strive for 1) sleek, different, elegant hardware 2) friendly, simple print design. Their interface design is trying to reflect both of these and, unfortunately, sometimes forgets its place in the process. However, I think that ITC Garamond Tall 'n' Fat and Myriad match(ed) Apple's desires. I'm sure that they aren't the most typo-rigorous choices, but they have other concerns. At least they didn't use Gill Sans, which is \\_everywhere\\_ in the US for corporations whose creative directors don't want to actually make a decision concerning their identity/ branding.   \n   \nBelieve me, Apple is in the upper echelons compared to some of the obscene 'style guides' I've seen. One major medical company actually stipulates \"san serif\" for headlines and \"serif\" for body copy!   \n   \nPS: The packaging for the old iPod was brilliant, and is a great example of what keeps a lot of people loyal.

What I want to know is why do people seem so eager to devote their mind and spirit to a corporation or corporations they know very little about? Believe me, if your opinion of a company is based on its website and its products, you have a _very_ incomplete picture.   \n   \nTo swerve back to the topic (sort of): What's so wrong about a given company using a chrome look to their mark, particularly Apple, if it also works in B/W, etc.? Is there something _inherently_ wrong about it? Again, I think that Apple has a pretty distinct look (as a whole) and some very strong brand management. They _are_ a consumer-oriented, image-conscious electronics manufacturer/ software developer. Why would they keep their image (which I consider to be a subset of their brand) static?   \n   \nLook at Nike. Their logo gets used in all sorts of materials and colors, but the Swoosh is still the Swoosh. I think the same goes for the Apple. The surface changes, but the mark endures. I understand the disdain for shiny, swooshy crap, but most of those low-grade redesigns often accompany a total brand overhaul and a total re-shaping of their mark. Apple has remained very controlled compared to many corporations. I think that's probably why we freak out every time they tweak (redress) the logo or change the typeface (What is it, _once_ so far?.   \n   \nIt's hard to be innovative and consistent at the same time. Most of the objections I've read are high-minded design concerns that ignore the practicalities of business and focus on a conceptual level, or are a general reaction to sheep-like actions of large corporations (which is hardly shocking). Consumers still know Apple, still recognize the mark, and Apple still looks contemporary. What other visual brand concerns should they, as a corporation, have?\n\n"

But why are you all acting surprised?   \nThis isn't news, it's their status quo.   \n   \nThe fact that Apple is going with a chrome logo is nothing   \nnew. It is true to what they've always done on both their   \nhardware and software sides.   \n   \nHardware: Beige boxes had the rainbow. The blue and white   \nboxes got a transparent blue plastic apple. The recent   \nPowerBooks have solid white ones.   \n   \nSoftware: Mac OS 7 had a rainbow \"Apple Menu\" logo. Mac   \nOS X has a blue plastic looking logo. The new one   \napparently will look like chrome instead of plastic.   \n   \n\\_\\_\\_   \nRe: The logo changes in general. Does Burton still change   \ntheirs annually? That's something IBM and FedEx can't do.   \nKudos to them for knowing how to break the rules.\n\n"
