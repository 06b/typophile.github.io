Here's an alphabet I put together from hand painted signage in and around my stomping grounds of Green Bay, WI. Thought you type nerds (like me) would enjoy this.   \n   \nInspired by both a collection of lettering in Vegas I saw in Veer, and a trip down Route 66, I took last summer.   \n   \nI've got some more pix of the signs themselves over at [my photoblog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017121059/http:/www.bradknapp.com/blog).\n\n",
