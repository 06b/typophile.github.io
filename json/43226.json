  "content": "I have seen a few threads on this but am looking for some more recommendations for serif fonts to pair with Ministry Script on a wedding invitation. The wedding won't be overly formal but I am looking for something that is classy and elegant to contrast Ministry Script. I've been testing Warnock Pro and Minion. Preferably something with an expert character set (small caps, etc.).\n\nAny ideas? Thanks for any help that you provide.\n\n",

Are you saying that Ministry does not meet your definition of classy and elegant? I just want to clarify your definition so I can give appropriate recommendations.\n\nIdeas:  \n [Eason](http://web.archive.org/web/20110513090031/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/eason/)  \n [Farnham](http://web.archive.org/web/20110513090031/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/farnham_text/)  \n [ITC Bodoni](http://web.archive.org/web/20110513090031/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_bodoni_twelve/)  \n [FF Reminga](http://web.archive.org/web/20110513090031/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_reminga/)  \n [Descendiaan](http://web.archive.org/web/20110513090031/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/descendiaan/)\n\n"
