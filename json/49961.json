Be very, very careful there TweakingKnobs - that doesn't sound like a good client.\n\nBut as to your question: maybe try [Gentium](http://web.archive.org/web/20141014165513/http:/scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium) - it's a relatively nice, \"classical\" looking serif.\n\n"

      "content": "TK, you might want to start by asking yourself \"is anything that's free have any quality?\" The same question could be asked about your services to them as a client. (Edit: Yes, there are many free typefaces out there that have lots of quality!)\n\nIf they're serious about investing (and business in general), then they'll surely understand that investing in a quality typeface will get them much further than a free one.\n\nAs far as suggestions go: It would be hard for anyone to know what typeface is suitable for their company, without having a deep understand for their business goals and their customers goals.\n\nGet to know them, and get to know type. I recommend reading Ellen Lupton's Thinking with Type: [http://www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141014165513/http:/www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/ \"http://www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/\") You can probably grab a copy from your local library (which would be free). It's an easy read, with plenty of food for thought.\n\n"

      "content": "TK,\n\nPerhaps you should see what other investment groups use for their identity. Think about what kind of message their type choices communicate and use this research as a baseline for exploring what typeface would work best for your mother's company.\n\nI don't really have any suggestions because right now the design problem is fairly vague - an investment company that doesn't appear to have a niche (what are they focused on investing in? who are they trying to serve?), I don't know what kind of audience they're looking for (who's going to use them? and why?), and I certainly don't know the people behind this company.\n\nDefining or answering these questions may help you have a better idea of what kind of typeface you're looking for - and then I might be able to help you more.\n\n"

As well reading up on the history of typography. A brief background would do you a lot of good at this point.\n\nBest,  \nJason R.  \n [www.jasonrobb.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20141014165513/http:/www.jasonrobb.com/ \"www.jasonrobb.com\")\n\n"

You cannot pick a typeface with no understanding of what it is for except \"investing\". Even if by chance, we happened to give you the perfect typeface, without any knowledge of typography you will probably put it to poor use.\n\nYou cannot build a house from the roof down my friend.\n\n"

      "content": "TK, the advice to do some homework so that you are equipped to make these types of decisions on your own is sound. It's what will make you a serviceable designer, leave alone great for the time being.\n\nHaving said that, here is a little (general) advice based on experience:  \nInvestment firms and law firms are two of the most conservative categories of client you will come across. They often look to convey trustworthiness and a penchant for winning with their communications. Friendliness and client focus are secondary elements to these types of brands. Contrast that with a personal banking service, who prefer to appear helpful and approachable. Investment and law firms are hired to be bulldogs. Typically, you want austere, conservative and traditional imagery that doesn't shout.\n\nBut only your mother and her partner can say if the above is appropriate to their business.\n\nAs for free fonts, have a look at Fontin Sans by Jos Buivenga.\n\n"
