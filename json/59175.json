Bring your sketchbook.\n\nPaul Shaw has indicated that he may do a typographic walking tour in Atlanta (free). We're thinking it might be Wednesday morning. But he's not arriving until Tuesday, and we probably won't have a commitment before boots-on-the-ground. So this will be ad hoc.\n\nPre-conference workshops start on Wednesday (all this info is up).\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, all us volunteers will be busily landing and putting things together. If you're around and want to pitch in, come find me or Michelle Hill, introduce yourself, and we'll see what we can do to plug you in.\n\nOfficial conference registration won't start until sometime on Wednesday.\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\n"

But I think James over-states the case a bit. To attend ATypI in the historic center of Mexico City, and to be in the streets in groups, and to pay attention to your surroundings will keep almost all risk at bay.\n\nI'm not well-traveled, so I cannot offer any comparisons with other big cities. Outside the USA the only big cities I've been to are Halifax [not all that big], Montreal, Vancouver, and Mexico City. I do not like cities, but in Mexico City I feel relaxed and calm; and safe. My wife and I walk all over the city or take the metro and busses. Very late at night we have friends or a maitre d' call us a safe cab.\n\nI've never met Cristobal, but after a side comment I made in a thread somewhere a while ago about a long walk we took across Mexico City on a Sunday morning, he must think my wife & I are gringos locos. In October I'll tell him about our late-night walk from Tlalpan to our hotel on Periferco Sur. Then he'll know I'm loco.\n\nHell, James: I even worry about being in Minneapolis at times.
