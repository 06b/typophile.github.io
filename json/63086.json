All of the students were surprised that this feature existed, so I thought maybe others were unaware of its existence.\n\nWhile viewing a glyph string in the metrics window, on a Mac, shift command P will unfill the glyph shapes and render them in their outline form. Very helpful if you are spacing a connecting script. Shift command N will give reveal the control nodes as well.\n\nJust thought this might be of interest. If it is old news my apologies for wasting your time.\n\nJames\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203132153im_/http:/typophile.com/files/outline_metrics_5124.jpg)\n\n",

It was done as an experiment, but I realized that it will require too much changes in internal data structures and UI, so we decided to leave it for next versions (where GW and MW will certainly be integrated).\n\n"
