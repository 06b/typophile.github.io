  "content": "Hello, Its my first time here very exciting. I was making this logo personally I dont like it but I am not sure if I dont like it because its for me considering we are our worst critics so I was wondering what you thought about it or if you can make any modifications of ideas youve, feel free. I was thinking in making it a lil stronger...   \n   \n ![Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013015518im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/34336.gif)   \n   \n   \nIts for a Wireless Internet Service Provider Red means Network in spanish and the W stands for Wireless.\n\n",

Seems like a nice place.   \n   \nI think the logo has potential, I like how the connected cells make up a W, perhaps the strokes should be slightly thicker as it could cause problems at low resolutions. Also I'm not keen on the typeface, I think it needs something stronger to go with that logo, maybe a really simple sans serif?\n\n"

      "content": "Benjamin -   \n   \nI like the icon form you have created - but it seems to be working against the typeface you have chosen. Perhaps something that compliments the round shapes in the icon a bit more? I do appreciate the fact that the word \"Red\" is presented in the color blue.   \n   \n:: :: :: :: :: :: ::   \n   \nJeff Fisher :: Engineer of Creative Identity   \nJeff Fisher LogoMotives   \n [http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013015518/http:/www.jfisherlogomotives.com/)   \n   \n:: :: :: :: :: :: ::   \n   \nUpcoming Speaking Engagements   \n   \n   \n2004 HOW Design Conference   \n [http://www.howconference.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013015518/http:/www.howconference.com/)   \nMay 16-19, 2004 :: San Diego, CA   \n   \n:: :: :: :: :: :: ::\n\n"
