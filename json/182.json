      "content": "Peter, is that list off the top of your head? If so, it's still helpful, thanks, but could you possibly find something official/methodical for Swedish? That would be great. And even more important than pairs would be word frequencies. All my own data comes from cryptographic and linguistic analysis, which I have access to thanks to UCLA. Except for the Polish data which I can thank Adam Twardoch for. I've been wanting to put it all up on my site, but...   \n   \nBTW, here's an idea: Could we have some kind of repository here on Typophile, where people submit frequency lists (with info about the source)? That would be killer. I'd contribute whatever I had (as long as I find the time to type it in... Or maybe I can do OCR).   \n   \nLigature Style:   \nThe difference comes from the fact that Thierry is an accomplished calligrapher. And although I'm not a big fan of calligraphy in type design, if tempered it results in some great ligatures, that's for sure. Yeah, some of them are pretty crazy, but remember that you never \\*have\\* to use a given ligature, but in any case each one is aesthetically superb. If you look at the \"AA\" in Mrs Eaves, for example, you can see it doesn't really \"sit\" very well. In terms of functionality, however, we could argue about which is better: constructed or painted ligatures. And of course that applies to type in general. I happen to think paint is for walls.   \n   \nLinguistic Hierarchy:   \nIn terms of Latinate writing systems, the main ones would be, in ~order: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Italian, and after that I wouldn't try to guess. But note that you might consider this order to be somewhat moot, because, for example: there's less piracy in Germany than in general; on the web Dutch has a disproportionate presence; and other factors.   \n   \nBTW, concerning \"customizing\" for languages, more important than ligatures would be spacing/kerning: it can have a very large effect on setting. For example, round-round shape-pairs have a very different frequency in English and French. And in English the word \"the\" is more common than fully \\*half\\* the letters of the alphabet, whereas since it's not as common in Spanish, you might sacrifice its spacing in favor of the \"ate\" string, for example.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
