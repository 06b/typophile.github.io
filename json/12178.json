Basically, it means \"a regular meeting at a bar, during which typography will be discussed.\" Currently, there are several Typostammtische in Germany.\n\nAlthough various chapters of German Forum Typografie may have informally used in the term for some of their meetings, it is held that the first regular Typostammtisch was established in Offenbach, a Hessian city near Frankfurt. The Offenbach Typostammtisch was founded by [TypeOff](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230613/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TypeOff) in the aftermath of TYPO Berlin 2004, and has been meeting regularly since June 2004. Since 2007, the Offenbach Typostammtisch has been organized by the Offenbach design studio TYPOSITION. Dates and locations are published on the _spatium Magazin_ blog, [http://www.spatium-magazin.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230613/http:/www.spatium-magazin.de/ \"http://www.spatium-magazin.de\")\n\nThe Offenbach Typostammtisch has inspired additional Typostammtische in Germany. For several years, a Berlin Typostammtisch, organized by Fontwerk ( [http://www.fontwerk.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230613/http:/www.fontwerk.com/ \"http://www.fontwerk.com\")), has met every other month. The Berlin Typostammtisch has the highest attendance of any Typostammtisch in the country.\n\nIn 2008, a Typostammtisch was founded in Saarbrücken. This Typostammtisch meets irregularly. In 2010, a monthly Typostammtisch was founded in Hamburg. There are additional Typostammtische in Cologne and Hannover, the later of which is run by a chapter of the Forum Typografie.\n\nTypostammtische on Flickr:  \n [Typostammtisch ‘The Original’ Offenbach](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230613/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/typostammtisch/)  \n [Typostammtisch ‘The Capital One’ Berlin](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230613/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/typostammtisch-berlin/)  \n [Typostammtisch ‘Close to little else’ Saarbrücken](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230613/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/typostammtisch-saar/)\n\n",
