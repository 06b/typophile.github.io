But there was no reasoning to it, we just started with a, and started with a. it sounded odd, but was kinda fun - my point is however it was completely impractical and imparted no feeling or meaning from the book at all, except you could see patterns from common letters like 'e's and'a's.\n\n"

And how does Kromofons do anything to change it? The fact that you enhance (as you claim, though this is highly doubtful to begin with) the connection between the shape/colour of an individual letter and the sound it represents on its own doesn’t change the fact that individual letters frequently lose or change their inherent sound when used in conjunction with other sounds. You’d have to apply Kromofons to pure IPA for it to make any kind of sense, and even then, it would present no actual improvement, since two people will usually pronounce the same word differently.\n\nAnd yes, _o_ is a fairly good graphic depiction of the sound the letter represents.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA bit silly, perhaps, to be responding to (and even asking questions to) someone who most likely just signed up and disappeared again those 11 months ago. Best consider this a rant, I guess.\n\n"
