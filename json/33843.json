      "content": "I have explored this kind of thing and I found that the only way to get a reasonble idea of what a color would look like would be to print a huge sheet or many smaller ones - the reason being that you need about an inch x and inch of color to see what your getting ( okay maybe a bit smaller...); and you need steps of 5%. Sometimes you need to dial things more tightly still. That adds up to a hell of a lot of squares.\n\nThere are companies that specialize in color management that sell sheets that are meant to help in a process that callibrates your documents to a given printing response. I actually built one for a VERY screwy color laser. It was a nightmare but an interesting one.\n\nWhy do you want this one sheet to rule them all anyway?\n\n"

I have to be honest that it took me quite a while to figure out a system in which you can immediately identify each percentage without having any doubles.

What a pleasant surprise, and very useful. Not only does it help with exact measurements for layouts, has colors for swatches - and for blends. Lets you get an idea for a color overprint - as opposed to knockout. It may be several years late in the coming, but still a gem.\n\nYou can read about it here: [http://www.code-line.com/software/artdirectorstoolkit.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012103650/http:/www.code-line.com/software/artdirectorstoolkit.html \"http://www.code-line.com/software/artdirectorstoolkit.html\")\n\nbut I'm probably late to the party, and all of you knew about this already - right?\n\n"

They were for calibration not for general reference.  \nI also found my old files they are overly precise, taking steps in 1% increments. Perhaps I should release them.... maybe one day. I also have a book called \"Process Color Manual, 24,000 CMYK Combinations for Design, Prepress, and Printing\" by Pat Rogondino & Michael Rogondino. It has maybe 50 pages or so and I think it uses the 5% jumps and covers the whole range from 0 to 100 in a fairly sequential manner.\n\nThinking about what you have described I am puzzled. Jumps of 25% seem awfully big to me. So how does it go? 0, 25, 50, 100? Have I understood you? It seems like 5 or 10% jumps would have far more utility.\n\nStill, I am interested to see what you made. I can send you some of the files I have if you are interested.\n\n"

As I already said earlier, it took me quite a while to make a userfriendly (I can't stress this enough) diagram in which all possible varations are shown without repeating a single one. Obviously, there's a lot of black, but that's because every combination with 100% black & the 100% CM&Y all make black. I haven't checked Jackie's link yet, but until now I haven't found any CMYK colour chart that covers everything in one scheme unless maybe it just \"sums them up\" with the percentages printed in the colours themselves, but in that case it's not really a diagram & can not be used as such.  \nIf anyone has any links to companies that make colour charts, please post them here.

      "content": "Thanks for the links everyone, but I'm afraid some of you are not quite getting my point. Jackie, your CMYK charts are the ones I've seen before (as mentioned in my original post), but it's really about getting àll possible combinations in òne (supersized obviously) chart that allows you to read 4 different values (the percentages of CMYK) without having any doubles. It's the idea behind the diagram what it's really about. In every CMYK chart I've seen so far, there's always one fixed percentage (usually Y), but in my chart all percentages of all colours are variable. I have found a way to unfold a 3D-model to a userfriendly 2D-diagram & I'm just trying to find out if this kind of thing has been done before. It may seem implausible & even quite arrogant of me to think that I might be the first one to come up with this diagram, but until now all Google sessions & links here seem to imply that indeed this kind of thing hasn't been made yet. Maybe nobody ever bothered to do so & everybody was quite happy with the colour charts spread over several pages & diagrams or maybe -and I might come off a little arrogant again here- I'm the first one to succesfully do it.  \nIt started off as a colour chart, but it is now really about the diagram and not the colours. All diagrams that I've seen so far have two axes (X & Y) & only display two values for each element. Mine displays 4 different values for each element & that's what I'm hoping is something new. It's very hard to explain without the diagram itself to illustrate what I'm talking about, but since I'm hoping this might be a discovery, I'm trying to \"protect\" my copyrights and what not before giving it away. As soon as my rights have been assured, I'll post an example here to illustrate my point with a brief explanation of how it came about.\n\n"

I wanted to put it all in one oversized chart WITH all percentages of black & WITHOUT any doubles (except for every combination with 100% K or the ones where all 3 C, M & Y percentages are 100%). I haven't really been doing anything with it lately, but I still have plans to post my idea in a iDepot online to assure my rights & then I'll post it here. But just to be on the safe side, don't hold your breath ;-) I've been working on too many things lately to even be bothered to pick this one up. More news will follow some day... probably.  \nBTW, I still haven't had any chance on the RGB-model, but again, I haven't been trying lately ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "I have to be honest & admit that I got bored with trying to find where to go to with this idea & kind of forgot about the whole thing until I was recently going through my archives. Since I don't really see myself picking up on that search I figured I might as well let you all in on my 'secret' (you've been patient enough ;-)).\n\nHere's what the Quadrigram looks like with percentages of 25:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012103650im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quadrigram_4687.gif)\n\nAs you can (hopefully) see in the quadrigram the values for black, cyan, magenta & yellow are read respectively on the left, top, bottom & right side.\n\nHere's how it's done:\n\nTo put 4 variables into one chart you need to create 4 axes to read your values from. Average diagrams use only one X-axis & one Y-axis making no use of the top & right space as far as value input goes.  \nHaving 2 horizontal (X1 & X2) & 2 vertical (Y1 & Y2) axes creates the need for different calibrations. This can be achieved by making use of small & big 'squares' for values for both axes (horizontally as well as vertically). The first thing you need to do is figure out the top value of one of your axes (for percentages it's obvious, but in this example I will use a top value of 4).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012103650im_/http:/typophile.com/files/figure1_6163.gif)\n\nFor the second axis we need to divide each seperate value into these 4 steps; in this case creating 5 blocks (0,1,2,3 & 4) of paired values 0-4.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012103650im_/http:/typophile.com/files/figure2_4071.gif)\n\nNow we do the same with the vertical axes to create a raster of big squares & one of small squares merged together & we'll thus be able to read 4 different values for each point (in the example the values for the coloured square are 3 for X1, 1 for X2, 3 for Y1 & 2 for Y2).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012103650im_/http:/typophile.com/files/figure3_5133.gif)\n\nThis method can be used for any kind of chart that needs to combine 4 different variables although for other charts it will lose the 'flowing' line that gives a first good impression of what to expect when reading the chart. Still it can be used to compress all information into one userfriendly chart.\n\n"
