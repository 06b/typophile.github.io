      "content": "The shape reminds me of a piece of paper. Therefore, I would think that the logo would match a company that deals with a lot of paper, like a copy shop, or an actual paper company. If that’s what your going for, then fine. But if I understand your Portuguese correctly (I am fluent in Spanish and Italian, and can read Latin), then mycorp is an “image and communication consultancy”? As a result, I don’t think your logo suggests a wider array of services besides paper based media.\n\n"

      "content": "@ nvhladek: you’re quite close to the meaning I guess. We will work with corporate id and webdesign, mostly.\n\n@ Haley:  \nThe idea behind this logo is the following:\n\n- Companies often show their corporate id on papers or on the web, and most times the logo of the company is on the top of the paper; here it would be represented on the right side, in the green triangle.\n- The white paper represents the old corporate id of a company, and the green triangle represents a new id behind the old one. Our job is to give the company a new corporate id., so the white paper represents the old “skin” of the company, being teared off, to show the new “skin” of the company.\n- The green triangle is an arrow pointing forward and top, showing the progress we want for our customers.\n- The triangle is also intended to be used in our branding stuff. In portuguese there is a word with two meanings: “destacar” means “detach” (or “tear off”, like a coupon we can tear off a paper); it also means “highlight” or “stand out”.  \nSo there there should be a play with this word, since the idea is to have some detachable corner in our papers, meaning also our customer can stand out off the crowd as well.\n\nMy English is not good, but I hope you understand what I mean.  \nAlso, the green color is not definitive, we are thinking about something different. Maybe a hot pink or so.\n\n"

Shake it a bit and see what falls out.  \nThe symbol as it is now is nice, but I’m afraid it has been used to death ever since it was possible to make a rectangle on a computer.\n\n"
