I want to revive the images to the exact standard we received them for our memory book. I am having issues determining what fonts are used.\n\nI appreciate all help and assistance greatly.\n\nUnfortunately mine is pretty ineligible, which I am distraught about! I have included various images which aren't copyrighted which use the same font as displayed in mine as it's from the same ultrasound machine.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417102504im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FONT-1_6262.PNG)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [NUMBERS.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417102504/http:/typophile.com/files/NUMBERS.PNG) | 4.7 KB |\n| [NAME.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417102504/http:/typophile.com/files/NAME.PNG) | 2.1 KB |\n\n",

However, I was looking for pictures of NASA Mission Control, and didn't see anything like that there, only much smaller printing.\n\nThat the machine was from Toshiba, however, is _very_ useful information; at least a web search might turn up more images of the same kind of print, even if the font has no name.\n\n"
