If anyone has any idea of what any fonts to any popular magazines are, I'd greatly appreciate it. I'd rather not scan as the quality won't be as good.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Most magazines use custom typefaces or typefaces which are going to cost money. I don't understand why a teacher would assign this project. Did they tell you to match the typefaces?\n\nThis is nothing against you Tami.\n\n"

      "content": "I have a similar issue, our instructor wants us to use found body copies that work for our assignments. I have developed a sweet spot for the serif typefaces used in W magazine... I might be crazy but I like the feel of their bold and regular serifs on my resume... I just can't figure out what they are. I don't think they are the same font either. Every time I get close on a font finder, it's still not quite right. They remind me of Bembo, and a search I came up with was Hoeffler Text or versions of garamond but, I just dont think they are quite right. I am also wondering exactly what the san serif font they use in the inside is for body and subheads.\n\nI'm just so frusterated in this search. If anyone could help me, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n"
