  "content": "Thanks to all for your expertise. I'm a graphic designer; my focus was always more on illustration, but I've learned a LOT that I needed to learn about typography by lurking here.\n\nHere's a question:  \nA while back I bought Body Copy Sans Pro by Bergsland.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/body-copy-sans-pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720135056/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/body-copy-sans-pro)  \nIt filled a gap in my text font collection; I had no \"elegant\" formal sans for such things as an invitation to a classy event; all were more utilitarian.\n\nI use the font way less than I expected, because I'm uncertain what display or headline font to use with it. I'm concerned I'll choose something that clashes; contemporary display fonts don't look right at all.\n\nWhat harmonizing headline font would you use with this body font if you wanted a distinctive, elegant look? What about Sigvar Bold?  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/sigvar-serial](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720135056/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/sigvar-serial)\n\nOr something like Bernhard Bold, even with the swash capitals?  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bernhard-modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720135056/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bernhard-modern)\n\nI was also considering one somewhat decorative with an Art Nouveau flavor, Letterhead Fancy Caps or Beaumarchais...Am I completely off base?  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720135056/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead)  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/beaumarchais](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720135056/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/beaumarchais)\n\nWhat about an upright script like Adore or Serena or even Pendulum?  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/adore](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720135056/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/adore)  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/serena/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720135056/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/serena/)  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/pendulum/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720135056/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/pendulum/)\n\nThanks in advance for your help! ~ Dina\n\n",
