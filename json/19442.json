I realy like the forms, but I’m not interested in purchasing the entire family, maybe just 2 or 3 weights. Does anyone know of a typeface that would give the same mood thats available à la carte?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n [‹ San-serif font for magazine redesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104233048/http:/typophile.com/node/19420 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font ID and organic/handcrafted font recommendations ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104233048/http:/typophile.com/node/18873 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
