As you said, font selection depends on audience. Older people hire. But maybe I'm tooo old.\n\nSeriously, My real problem with all this is I wouldn't use Sabon. It was one of the few text fonts that worked well on the Linotron 202, but somehow never survived the transition to PostScript. The PostScript italic is dreadful.\n\nNow if I were hiring a book interior desiger and they used Sabon on their CV, they would start pretty far down the list. Things may well be different for people hiring another kind of designer, which is what makes your \"audience\" remark so very perceptive and appropriate.\n\nThe only thing I disagree with is the '80s look. Wasn't that the \"me first\" and \"disco\" decade? I think Syntax rather better than that.\n\n"

A lot of Sans have a much larger x-height than Sabon and I was trying to narrow it down to the best matches.\n\n"
