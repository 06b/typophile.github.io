Wulf Barsch showed up to a class and noticed a case of Staedtler Lumograph pencils. <cite>\"Did you know that these were created for the purpose of drawing on foil?\"</cite> No I didn't know that. It was worth a try. It was only after writing in foil though that I began to take seriously the idea of making type from my handwriting—an idea I had kept for a long time. There comes with writing on foil a remarkable feeling of the medium pushing back; have you ever noticed that?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312053148im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0139_5615.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312053148im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0138_3558.JPG)\n\n",

      "content": "It's a different medium, that's all. What I like best about it is the foil's reaction to a soft pencil. It's slick, so it's similar to writing or drawing on photo paper with a wet permanent marker; but because it gives just a little, it lends some control to the curves. That helps a lot—both to achieve the look you want first—and later if you're doing something like overlaying bezier curves.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312053148im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0164a_5157.jpg)\n\n"
