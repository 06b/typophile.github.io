Does anyone know a good rule af thumb for how much the text length will increase once the translation into German occurs?   \n   \nA colleague of mine remembers an increase of around 30% in overall length. Can anyone confirm this figure or offer a more educated answer?   \n   \nThanks in advance...\n\n",
