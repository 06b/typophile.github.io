  "content": "Hello everybody.   \n   \nMaito Recordings is an upcoming   \non-line based music label, which   \nreleases music free, downloadable   \ndirectly from our main website.   \nThe Maito Recordings focuses in   \nexperimental sound landscapes and   \nambient music, electronic and acous-   \ntic.   \n   \n(note: the word \"maito\" is finnish   \nand means milk)   \n   \nHaving some hint on graphic design,   \nI decided to try out and make the   \nlogo all by myself.   \n   \nThe emblem resembles a milk stain,   \nfrom a glass of milk, which somehow   \ntries to represent the idea of aeste-   \nthics in chaos and randomness. The   \nway the music is created (ambient,   \nnoise, drones etc.) what i've   \ndiscovered, is quite often based on   \nrandomness. Well.. that's the basic   \nidea behind the emblem.\n\n<!--attachment: maito_logo-35511.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*58.1*Maito+Recordings+%2dlogo*maito_logo%2epdf --><!--attachment: maito_logo-35511.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*58.1*Maito+Recordings+%2dlogo*maito_logo%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130821231341im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">Maito Recordings -logo<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130821231341/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/maito_logo-35511.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>maito_logo.pdf</b></a> (58.1 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n\nNow comes the hard part. Typography.   \n   \n 1. Kerning. How can I improving it?   \n 2. Composition between logotype and emblem?   \n 3. Alignment between \"maito\" and \"recordings\"?   \n   \nIn the logotype sans is Univers Thin Ultra Condenced and serif is Bembo.   \n   \nAll advice is warmly welcome.\n\n",
