Do you like it? What impression do you have seeing it for the first time?  \nI'd appreciate any comments on it.\n\nKind regards,\n\nPiotr\n\n",

Your work should be the primary focus. Right now, when the page loads, it's all the 'meta' info that has the primary focus, with your actual work way down at the bottom of the scrollbar.\n\n"

      "content": "@ **fontplayer** I actually removed all the unnecessary graphic elements. It looks better indeed. So thanks for that!\n\n@ **laCour** Removing some useless text is not idea actually, note that this is a one-page portfolio and there are pros to this (like all the info is in one place—and that's why you may feel like there is too much stuff).. However I'll try minimizing the content, so comment more than appreciated :-)\n\n@ **aluminum** I'm afraid I didn't understand the first point. Is removing the pattern background what you meant? I'd disagree then. About the block-structure reorganization.. I guess It's worth a shot.. I might move the right column and put it under 'What I do section' so I could put the selected work above the fold.\n\nThanks guys! I knew it was a good place to ask for help.\n\nKind regards,\n\nPiotr\n\n"

I'll do some testing though. Sometimes it's just better to try so you could see the difference. Thanks for pointing it out then!\n\n"

It can cause people to not register that there might be more content below.

      "content": "It is refreshing to see Roman lettering used well on a web-page. I feel the overall effect is pleasing and the javascript opening captions under the figures is fun. Perhaps the page needs a bit more contrast in size between the large and small images and fonts. The colors are too cool: gray lettering on a gray background with that pale blue gives a cold feeling. I wish Typophile will change that combination too. Let in some of that famous Tuscan sunshine. When you are finally happy with the result why not submit your css concepts to [http://www.csszengarden.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310021859/http:/www.csszengarden.com/ \"http://www.csszengarden.com/\") ?
