  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI am a third year Graphic Design student currently working on a project in which I'm trying to mimic gravestone typography.\n\nI've recently been reading Robert Bringhurst's \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" which has detailed the use of fonts such as Mantinia and Augustea as classic stone engraving typefaces (whether designed specifically for that use or inspired by it).\n\nHowever, from my own research, there seems to be a lot more use of Caslon, Bodoni and Bembo in the modern day due to changing technologies in the way that the text is applied to the stone/granite/marble memorial.\n\nI was wondering peoples opinions on which is more relevant to communicating gravestone typography? And also, with the same question in mind, whether there are any specific layout styles synonymous with these memorials?\n\nThanks for any advice you can offer.\n\n",
