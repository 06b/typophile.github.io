I believe that Linotype should have the rights to it but I can't find it on there website.\n\nI can't even find a highres sample online.\n\nAny high quality fonts that might be an adequate substitute?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

In use the type would soon be stressed and the wedges would be pushed into the main stroke, or pushed outwards. Where digital versions are based on different impressions, this should account for the variation in appearance. As for the R, I don't know if it's a redesign or a font size difference.  \nA proper digital version would be a real treat!  \nDon\n\n"
