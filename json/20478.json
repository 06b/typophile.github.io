Here's the rundown (my opinion only)\n\n- Escrow - Not quite curly enough (old looking)\n- Precosia - Very nice, might be a bit hard to read at smaller  \n sizes, lightbox material\n- American West - Close, but a bit too cliche western looking\n- Maverick's Luck - Close, add that one to the lightbox\n- Kilkenny - might be a bit too light\n- Missionary - I couldn't have asked for a more exact font for what  \n I asked, but it's too thin, too\n- Calliope - getting really close here, add this one to the  \n lightbox too\n- Eccentric - I didn't even think of something like that, could  \n work\n- Berolina - Again, a direction I didn't even think of, I love this  \n board!\n- Cafe Corina - VERY CLOSE! In fact, I plugged away in that site a  \n bit, Billhead and Tyler are almost perfect. Added all three to the lightbox\n\nOkay, I just got some further direction. The logo type will read \"Neverthelesser\" and it is to be a short animated film set in 1906 San Francisco on the day of the big quake. I think we have the typefaces here to work with, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to maybe mix & match them to make an interesting logotype for a short animated film?\n\nI would love you thoughts and thank you so very much for these suggestions. Huh, education can be fun! I guess my teachers were right all along. Who'd a thought?\n\n"

But they don't have a typesetter so it's a bit annoying.\n\n"
