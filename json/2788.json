I guess your question was not very clear, that is why you got no feedback.   \n   \n... so what is your question?   \n   \nIf it's about logotype tuning, I have a favorite: Miles Newlyn's 2002 Honda tuning. And while Matthew Carter's MoMA is not an exciting update, I still think he's a great type designer (I love his work for Walker Art Center - [www.walkerart.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018225054/http:/www.walkerart.org/))   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nMarius\n\n"

Huge difference. And if the MoMA people like using a text font for their logo that's their problem.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "In the case of the MoMA logo, this is simply replacing one typeface by another. Often finetuning of a logo becomes necessary because the original has been physically degraded, e.g. during transfer of the image from one technology to another, or because people implementing the identity have not strictly followed guidelines or used original source versions. This is particularly true for large organisations that have multiple offices in different cities or countries working with local design agencies to produce material that uses the logo.\n\n"
