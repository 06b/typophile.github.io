It’s easier to kern letters you can’t read, and youre so used to seeing not only these letters, but these words, that you often over-look the spacing even when you’re trying to.\n\nSimple Solution: turn the type upside down. The gaps will jump out at you instantly.\n\nHope this trick helps if you didn’t already know it, I know it’s saved me more times than I wish to admit...\n\n"
