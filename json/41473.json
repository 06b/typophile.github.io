      "content": "It is very similar to the exclusive type of Porsche, and may even be by the same person. Both Volkswagen and Porsche have paid for exclusivity on their fonts - not for the general public. I understand that an old Volkswagen (that look like Frankfurter) was released, but I still haven’t seen it. Don’t know if this is a help to you or not, sorry for rambling. Hope you find it. If you are just looking for something similar - check out Science Fiction/Techno categories. If this were a typeshop, those would be the first volumes I’d have the guys pick up to start their search in.\n\n"
