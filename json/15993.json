I feel that a font file, like a piece of film type or a hot-metal matrix is just one instance of a typeface design, so calling a particular digital instance \"software\" doesn't seem to reflect negatively on the typeface design itself, but I'd be interested in the forum’s thoughts on this issue.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n",

Maybe it isn't _necessary_ to use them both at the same time. Maybe, depending upon context, you will use them in different order. But, I think because the legal is so deeply ingrained into it, it will always be necessary.\n\nFor those of us whom appreciate -- as David does, and myself for that matter -- the hours that really go into _creating_ a typeface we only need think of them as **creative works** that also happen to be a tool that runs like **software**.\n\n"

And definitely typography contains some coding, but that does not make it software. A car has an engine, but a car is not an engine. You may choose to speak about, or use, or midify the engine part of the car, which may affect the whole appearance and/or functioning of the car, but it still remains a car not an engine.\n\nSimilarly, a font is a font, even if some part of it may be software, it cannot be identified as softwarfe alone. The other side is also true: you cannot say that a font is only a set of letter drawings.\n\n"

There are other ways to slice it, but fonts (as software), are the key dividing line between design of the type, and design of the typography. So we, founders, (Font Software Developers if I'm talking to Another Audience), work in our many ways along the lines given to us by the dumb mechanism folk, (dumb being good in this context), to give the best experience possible for everyone from the \"not much\" things-people-do-with-type people to the too much things-people-do-with-type people, all with a single product.\n\n(...or does he mean that this particular industry has so many shining facets that he can't quite get a grasp on the sheer brilliance of it all? or is it too hard to be on the inside as one of those facets and have to change the context of his discription of what he is, every time he has to describe it in each new context that he meets?...)\n\n"

The word technology here never stops at computers!.. You can make the font and print it without using computer at all! It is like Chess board you can craft it using gold, craft it using silver and make it an antique. You can code chess board by computer also, and you name it chessmaster or Fritz, but no body can say \"chess\" is a software!  \nAnother point here.. Do you name a design done in photoshop a software? Say you made a poster and you have put pictures ( done by camera ), fonts, some textures done on papers by pencils, and some photo proces done by photoshop. Then you seperate colors and print it . Do we say it is all a software? I disagree.. it is a \"design process\" for me, and the designer used art, and scince to make his final product. This is my own opinion.\n\n"

It seems that when something is regarded as such, the public's right to access is considered a greater good than the rights of originators. There is also this idea that \"the alphabet\" is in the public domain and that fonts are simply instances of \"the alphabet\" It all falls down when you consider that some fonts are more in demand than others.
