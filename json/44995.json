Then, I will be able to write proper English, I hope.\n\nI completely agree with your comments. Another optional font I am thinking to use is Edward Johnston´s P22 Underground; he designed it to be used in London Underground. Do you think that it would be wrong to use it?\n\nThank you once again\n\n"

Colours are not specify though the university plays with white and dark blue. However, I consider that Ruskin Gallery should be independent and have its own identity.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705161629im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/B%20(4)_6653.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705161629im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/IMG_0787_4863.JPG)\n\nWell, as you can see. They use New Gothic Font. The Wayfinding for Ruskin Gallery is just...really bad. The whole university started as “School of Art” in 1858 but, just recently has changed its name to Anglia Ruskin University.\n\nThis is one of the reasons for what I thought to give it a more personal look to the signage would be appropiate it.\n\nAt the moment, I´m trying to simplify this idea, make it more contemporary but with a hint of the Arts & Crafts Movement.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705161629im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Signage%201-A%C2%B73_3906.png)\n\nThanks for your time :)\n\n"

But I do hope you have licensed the weight of P22 Underground that you are using.\n\nIf you put the mark in a box you are creating constraints that will only cause you problems later. The box you’ve used really doesn’t “fit” the shape of the mark even so it ends up just feeling like a random box. Additionally, because you are doing wayfinding you’ll find that some shapes are already forced upon you in the shape of the signs so you’ll need to be as flexible as possible.\n\nYou might benefit from looking at the work from Pentagram.\n\n[http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/signage/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705161629/http:/pentagram.com/en/portfolio/signage/ \"http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/signage/\")  \n [http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/marks/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705161629/http:/pentagram.com/en/portfolio/marks/ \"http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/marks/\")  \n [http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/identities/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705161629/http:/pentagram.com/en/portfolio/identities/ \"http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/identities/\")\n\n"

I wasn´t 100% happy with the results as my time management has not been really great! I spent a lot of time in a Graphic Installation as well as in a Live proyect. Now, I´m trying to get a placement during summer time.\n\nKind regards,  \nA bite of life\n\n"
