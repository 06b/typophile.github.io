  "content": "Letritas: 2 years\n\nLetritas (Typies) is turning to its second birthday and wishes to invite you to a costume party.\n\nAnd, since the blog is growing up thanks to its audience, it is fair to extend this invitation to everyone who is interested.\n\nSo, this is the right moment to show the world how much we've learnt in the past 2 years and how fearless of typography we've become. We'll play to dress the Letritas line logo any way you want.\n\nEvery work sent will be published in the blog, along with its credits and portfolio URL (and address contact if you wish), as well as a brief comment of the costume's concept.\n\nOn Friday, March 28, lights of colors will glow and our guests will come to show their best dance-steps.\n\nFrom this moment consider yourselves invited.\n\nWishing you all the best, Juan Pablo de Gregorio\n\n",
