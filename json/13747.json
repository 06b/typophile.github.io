Long or short text? Cap sizes larger than 5 inches? Five feet?

Lyons Collection of Wood Types that Letraset originally licensed before Agfa-Compugraphic.\n\n**CORRECTION:** Sans Serif Shaded originally came from the foundry of Stephenson Blake & Co. and NOT T.J. Lyons\n\nThe shaded version became wildly popular in late '60s -- early '70s, making its way onto many bookcovers and record albums (you know, those big black round flat things before CDs).\n\nI remember being amazed that the design originated from an old wood type, since to me it seemed very contemporary. Gee, it was old, but came back in style!\n\nSomeone please correct me if my recollection is wrong, as I wouldn't want to create false history.\n\n-------------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I'm Sans Serifs Shaded!\n\n"
