It`s well balanced and the space betwenn “M” and “a” is right to hold in tension.  \nFor purpose… i would guess it for fashion or singer? :o)\n\n"

      "content": "The problem with digitizing handwriting is that it almost always has the appearance that Streamline gives, antiseptic and ‘cleaned-up’ which is precisely what you don’t need, plus the lack of difference between characters – no-one writes exactly the same character twice.  \nThere are some areas where that feel is reproduced in your logo; the counter of the first a where the loop doesn’t quite lead to the k and the ar ligature has an awkward kink just before the loop of the r. The overall appearance is good but there is room for improvement, I think you should look at making the second a wider (possibly wider than the other two to compensate for the complex joining structures).  \nTim\n\n"
