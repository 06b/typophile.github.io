  "content": "In the process of creating a mark for a new startup, which helps its clients’ in articulating business messages, through appropriate old and new media, rapidly and simply, using technology tools.\n\nI wanted something minimal looking, but at the same time readable, unique and got certain element of recall. Working alone, I felt maybe I should get some help/critique, before I venture fully resolving it as a mark, and thinking of its application elsewhere.\n\nThis has to work well both in print and digital. I am already facing problem with this unit while I am reducing it to smaller sizes, which I feel need tweaking within particular sizes.\n\nI personally like the fact that at the first glance it isn’t decipherable fully but would get after a while (I hope so). Once the visual cue is solved, people would remember it long. Not sure whether—  \n1. I am on the right track, or whether i should completely ditch this idea and go for something else.(since its too abstract)  \n2. Typographically whether the letters and its proportions need to be re–looked? (I already had many iterations on the ’B’ part, also the fact, I do not want the counter spaces to be straight horizontals)  \n3. Will this last long or die faster as a fad?\n\nWill be very happy if someone could throw some light, and help me in decision making. Please feel free to comment everything and anything, even the gut feeling.\n\nThank you - Shalin\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081028162612im_/http:/typophile.com/files/zebu_3931.jpg)\n\n [‹ Verizon Logo Redesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20081028162612/http:/typophile.com/node/50986 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Your thoughts.. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081028162612/http:/typophile.com/node/50850 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’d almost go in the complete opposite direction. Thin, spaced out letters, something very pure and simple.\n\nWhat does ZEBU stand for, is that just another WEB 2.0 nonsense name? Or does it have some roots?\n\n"

As Asvetic suggested initially this logo will produce more problems than positives so go with something different. Start anew. I may also say that these shapes don’t look even anyway and they are not really well done. They could probably be more balanced with each other but try other ideas as well.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
