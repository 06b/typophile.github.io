Open your Word document showing your font, and use the 'Save as PDF' add-in to generate the PDF.\n\nTypophile won't let you attach a PDF to a discussion comment, so you'll need to either upload the PDF to another website and provide a link from Typophile, or send the PDF to someone who can do this for you.\n\n"
