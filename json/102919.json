She wants this one (which I think may have been actually done by hand) but what she likes is the calligraphy, hand drawn look of it, the girly, bubbly script of it and the boldness of the font (she's not a fan of thin calligraphy).\n\nSo I need help either confirming that this is hand drawn (she just sent me a picture of it so I don't have much to investigate) and if it is hand drawn, is there a font that is very similar to this with the characteristics explained above!\n\nThis would be a life saver!!
