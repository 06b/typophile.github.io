  "content": "Hello\n\nI’m working on a women’s fragrance project and the theme is a swinging 1960s mod-girl kind of Carnaby Street look. Twiggy, vibrant colors and patterns, etc. Part of the packaging features Op Art patterns. I’m looking for a typeface that reinforces this theme. The research I’ve done has uncovered surprisingly staid and low-key typography on the actual graphics from the era, at least connected with fashion, and none of it seems right. I’d like something mod and idealy feminine/girly and fun, energetic, that evokes the era and its spirit. Maybe a script. Any ideas? Thanks much for any help you can offer.\n\nRob\n\n [‹ Sans Serif Search](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204536/http:/typophile.com/node/17851 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Doctors Handwriting ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204536/http:/typophile.com/node/17803 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The original practitioners were young and free from convention but soon Madison Avenue found something fresh to mimic. The result was kinda’ almost but did not have the personality of the hand-made originals.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
