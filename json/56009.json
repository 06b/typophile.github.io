  "content": "I'm throwing a house party this weekend and want to make a couple really neat flyers featuring the fonts from my favourite \"quality\" beers. Pabst and Budweiser.\n\nHere is what i was wondering if anyone could identify\n\n1. What font \"Pabst\" is written in? I know it's probably hand rendered, but does anyone know anything similar?  \n2. What font \"Blue Ribbon\" is.  \n3. I like this old style Bud can. Trying to identify the \"Budweiser\" letters as well as the script text that says..\"Brewed by our original...\"\n\nThanks for any help. I heard you folks are the best at identifying ANY font!?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 17.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042747/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2017_6.png) | 706.05 KB |\n\n",
