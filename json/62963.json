The 1 is unlike anything I've found in other versions of Baskerville.\n\nIf it is indeed a version of Baskerville, the biggest question is what digital version would have been available in the early 90s with old style numbers?\n\nThe Adobe version 'BaskervilleBE' from the early 90s came from the Berthold cut and doesn't have the old style numbers. I don't believe the Linotype version has them either.\n\nI found 'Baskerville 353' from Foundry listed on pg. 29 and 30 of 'Type Speciman Book' but aspects of that don't exactly match the sample. I keep looking at the italic \"f\" and regular \"g\" in the print and can't get past how much shorter the tail is on the \"Q\" in comparison with that of Baskerville.\n\nIt might be [ITC New Baskerville](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043422/http:/www.identifont.com/find?font=ITC+new+baskerville&q=Go) but the \"1\" doesn't seem to match. :\\\n\n"
