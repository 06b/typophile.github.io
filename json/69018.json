This is a screen grab of what they are working on right now. A glyph palette! This will be part of the [TypeDNA plugins for Adobe's Creative Suite](http://web.archive.org/web/20150327015058/http:/www.typedna.com/adobe_cs_font_plugins/). So, until Adobe gives us an integrated glyph palette, perhaps this will do the trick!\n\nSee a [larger image](http://web.archive.org/web/20150327015058/http:/farm3.static.flickr.com/2687/4479506188_f7078e30a5_o.png) here.\n\nI'm not sure how many questions Darren will answer at present, but if we can keep the questions here I'll let him know about this thread.\n\n",
