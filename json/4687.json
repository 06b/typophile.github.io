Try thinning   \nthese a bit, or slapping in some traps   \nto balance. I agree with ole about the e,   \nand the R needs something done, looks   \nlike it has steeped in a mince pie and is   \nleaping back. I think the S is a bit wobbly   \nin regards to stroke weight as well.   \n   \nhere is a good link for hints on spacing,   \nwhich will inevitably help with the overall   \ndesign:   \n   \n [http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.01.spacing.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012191333/http:/briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.01.spacing.htm)   \n   \nBy the way, is it sweet to show my stuff to the   \nman?

In the end it is a balancing act. The goal is to make it look like the points are the same width as the stem or smaller, while keeping the joins free of clogging. You have four weapons to fight with:   \n   \n1. The widening the join (as you've done)   \n2. The widening the whole glyph (opens the angles)   \n3. Subtle tapering of stems (opens the angles)   \n4. Trapping   \n   \nIn the following example I've used less of 1 and more of 4. The darker the weight, the more gymnastics will be required for even color. This glyph is pretty light and maybe could survive with no trapping and a bit more #2. How you mix the weapons is part or your thumbprint on the font.\n\n"
