      "content": "Thanks very much for your replies. I had a look at this font to be part of a logo. I found it struggled at small sizes and maybe it was a little too different from what's out there so I passed on it. I though about bello small caps, but wanted something a bit more solid, clean and simple, sans serif or serif, more formal I guess. The logos progress goes on but I still haven't found the right font. i want it to be individual, but simple maybe a contridiction. The fonts i've looked at have been chalet (overused) vag rounded (too playful) bello ( individual) itc serif gothic (looks nice but has copperplate elements that I don't like). I think I would like a geometric sans with some roundness or serif but without the acenders ending in a square like shape. The audience is magazine, below line work, publishers, individuals. I want to avoid looking to technical.\n\nThats nothing to do with bello, but I thought I'd give an explaination of sorts why I haven't gone with it. It is lovely though.\n\nNick I really love your beaufort font and have used it within magazines! thanks\n\n"
