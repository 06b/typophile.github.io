Especially in making notes of ideas or phone numbers etc, but thats probably just because its how I was educated I guess.\n\nMaybe I'll experiment with not using a pen or pencil for a week (except drawing) and just using stickies and notes (though perhaps I should buy some piece of i-phone/blackberry type technology first…)\n\n",

It'll be one of those interesting facets about something that somehow in an elite crowd might make them seem \"more intellectual\" but not much else.\n\nOn the other hand, as a child of the computer age, and having done school projects on computer from third grade on (hard to do handwriting journals on the computer :) ), I find quickly drawing diagrams, taking non-textual notes and other sorts of things nearly impossible on the computer, at least not at the speed needed to keep up in class or a meeting. So barring some new fancy program, I expect to see handwriting live on as a very very niche use.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

      "content": "I think the author of the article is confusing the nature of the problem she and her son are facing, although the first paragraph says it all:\n\n_My son, who is in third grade, spends much of his school day struggling to learn how to form the letter “G.” Sometimes he writes it backwards. Sometimes the tail on his lowercase “T” goes the wrong way. His teachers keep telling him he may fail the state assessment standards._\n\nThe problem isn't handwriting, the problem is schools, teachers and things like state assessment standards. Most schooling is institutional child abuse, and giving up pens and pencils in favour of computers isn't going to change that.\n\nI'd say that making a G backwards and then gradually understanding shape orientation is a pretty important developmental step: probably more important as a step than being able to write the G correctly. Of course, shape orientation can be learned in other ways, but writing letters and numbers is a good way to learn it and comes with other benefits: fine motor skills (which you don't get, for example, learning shape orientation by flipping and rotating shapes on a computer screen), and of course the ability to produce something that someone else can read, even if the only thing you have to hand is a stick of graphite. And contra what the author writes, there is lots of evidence of the importance of manual interaction in intellectual development (and for this reason it is one of the key principles of the Montessori method, which strikes me as pretty much the only humane and sane approach to education for young children).\n\n"

It is NOTHING to be concerned about nor dreaded. Government insistence that standardized testing by means of remembering meaningless dribble has done more to dismantle education than anything. Government officials are seeking ways to \"PROVE\" that children are learning as much as those in other countries and force teachers to waste precious time on test preparation rather than on learning important skills. All of these tests have done is prove that kids learned more before we started testing!  \nExercising the brain is an important thing to do. One of the important ways to do it is by reading and writing. Writing is a developmental process which begins slowly with numerous errors which give students something to examine and learn by doing. No wonder students today have so little initiative, they have it strangled out of them before they are 10 years old!\n\nIt isn't a matter of if we will later in life communicate by our handwriting, it is a case of learning the process of having different segments of our brain work together to do many different tasks.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

I see, and respect, the point that learning which way round to draw a \"G\" has beneficial effects besides actually learning about lettershapes, but shouldn't education also be about preparing kids for the world they live in? Meaning, get them in touch with the tools of the time as well.\n\nFor what it's worth, I learned to write (and read) with my mum's typewriter when I was about four. I don't think this harmed my understanding of words and communication at all. Quite the opposite, actually. \"Look, Ma, I can press these keys here in a different order and it makes a new word!\"\n\nThat said, I'm not sure the idea of trying to immediately and completely abolish handwriting is fruitful, or practicable today (though it might be soon). I'm thinking a small dose of handwriting will remain in our lives as a tool next to other tools for a while; at least as long as we don't have good enough digital tools to enable us to note down say a phone number quickly, handwriting will remain useful\\*. – But definitely, teach kids to type!\n\n\\* And maybe voice recognition will/can be just that.

It also teaches a young brain abstract thinking, hand-eye coördination, etc. I can't really explain it very well in English, but I think you get my point.\n\nI can't imagine why someone would _not_ want to learn how to write well. Just because the 'need' for it is becoming a less important factor? I think that's a pretty weak argument. You also don't 'need' to learn how to play the piano, but alot of people do it anyway.\n\nI can remember I was really proud when I learned how to write somwhat readable. My first school used to teach a non-italic non-connected type of handwriting, when I switched schools the new school tought a connected-italic-like writing method, and I loved it! Now I could write in two different ways, how marvelous! This is also what sparked my interest in typography and type design.\n\n"

This includes its basis in articulatory phonetics, and it's transparency to syllabic componency. However as a system of marks or strokes, according to the wikipedia.org entry on Hangul that I consulted, all Hangul letters follow the rules of Chinese calligraphy.\n\nBy the 1400s, chinese calligraphy had long become an optical-grammatically mature and combinatorially powerful script.\n\nWriting is not the headless horseman Hrant wants to pretend it is. The problem with the latin script is not it's optical-grammatical structure, nor its combinatory arithmetic. It's its wonkiness as a representational system for the articulatorily fluid and linguistically polyglot environment it has to serve, extending it far beyond the Latin of it's birth.\n\nLearning writing is an inculcation of the perceptual psychophysical grammatology of a script.

It was to appease his court, which was of course infested with status-quo Chinese-language bureaucrats, that the Chinese calligraphy angle was spliced in.

They aren't harddrives, for chrissakes!\n\nI cannot prove anything but I think it is essential to learn proper handwriting, because it trains the brain in a unique way (just like drawing does in it's own way). It's not just a matter of being able to decipher glyphs on a screen. Typing is also different than writing, not better or worse but different. I have nothing against teaching kids with modern tools, but this doesn't disqualify old methods. It's not a case of either/or but of and/and.\n\ncheerio Queneau\n\n"

It's comical to picture the not-too-distance past -and the not-too-distant future- where people did -and will do- just fine without authoring visible language by hand.

I don't think it is a skill at moving my fingers on a trackball or cursor keys to edit bezier curves, although there is some basic manual competence involved. The skill is in looking and in understanding what I see. There is a difference of kind between the skill involved in making shapes on a computer and making shapes by hand, which has to do with the directness of the relationship between hand, tool and shape. What this means in terms of working with a pen or working with a computer is not that there is a switch between parallel but different skills -- since in the area of design the core skill, of seeing and understanding, remains the same regardless of the tool --, but whether a separate set of skills -- manual, fine motor skills, controlling a mark-making tool in direct contact with a medium -- is employed or bypassed. Or, in the case of education, whether these skills are developed at all.\n\n"

It's reassuring to hear you say that!  \nFWIW, when I started out designing my font, I spent about two months awkwardly sketching stuff on tracing paper that never looked right; my design process, the search for the shapes I wanted only took off once I put those sketches aside and moved to FontLab.  \nSo I'm always bewildered when people seem to think that analogue drawing skills are some sort of _sine qua non_ for design in general. Especially nowadays.\n\n_\"The skill is in looking and in understanding what I see.\"_  \nThat's a very good point. Of course béziers are a tool to be learned and understood too, but one that definitely favors brainpower over physical dexterity. I hear too many from the \"hand-drawing fraction\" say stuff like \"only the hand can produce smooth curves\". Well mine can't.\n\nWhich reminds me: \"physical dexterity leads to mental dexterity\", as has been stated in this thread, seems… well, let's say oversimplified at the very least, if not somewhat beside the point in the digital age. If I was thinking the way I can draw, I'd have an IQ of about 50.\n\n_\"What this means [is] whether a separate set of skills — manual, fine motor skills, controlling a mark-making tool in direct contact with a medium — is employed or bypassed.
