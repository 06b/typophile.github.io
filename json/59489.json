  "content": "Following [our proposal](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014143948/http:/blog.fontembedding.com/post/2009/06/29/Revised-Web-Fonts-Proposal.aspx) for a Web specific OpenType-based font format (which we named OTW), we received a lot of feedback from type designers, web designers and publishers. Most of the feedback was positive. People saw that differentiating web fonts from desktop fonts, and including licensing information in the font file was a step in the right direction.\n\nMoving the plan forward, we felt that with the support of browser makers we could have OTW standardized within two years, and have the majority of installed browsers supporting it within five to six years, based on current browser upgrade rates.\n\nHowever, web designers want to use commercial fonts today. They don’t want to wait five or six years. This is evident from the use of Flash-based solutions, and the interest in commercial services like TypeKit. So we took a step back and asked ourselves what can we do to accelerate the rate of adoption? With this in mind we decided to take another look at EOT.\n\nMicrosoft’s EOT format has a large installed base and is supported in every version of Internet Explorer since IE version 4. And as IE users are typically the slowest to upgrade, adding EOT support to other browsers would provide a quicker adoption of a single web font standard because the other browsers have much faster upgrade rates. However, we know that the other browser makers don’t like EOT because it includes URL binding, proprietary compression and gives Microsoft a head-start.\n\nWith this in mind we propose “EOT Lite”. Essentially EOT minus URL binding and compression, but with the addition of licensing information. The benefits are obvious, EOT Lite fonts will work with IE4 and above, can be easily supported in other browsers, and with their faster upgrade rates, we could see 90% of installed browsers supporting the format within a year. EOT Lite would still have the benefits of OTW: a font file that is differentiated from desktop fonts and containing license information.\n\nIn summary, and as a result of a significant dialogue with many stakeholders, we believe EOT Lite is the right solution for web fonts. We encourage everyone to support this solution with us.\n\n",

Lighter weights of sans fonts work pretty well on Mac OS, but bold weights render poorly at small sizes. Hinting will be the next big stumbling block for web fonts: designers are going to go up in arms when they realize how bad the fonts look and blame font designers, but they won’t want to pay for well-hinted screen fonts because so few exist that there’s really no baseline for what they should cost.

Actually it would be easier especially for smaller foundries to do without these two options and just add the header.)  \nThat certain browsers only support one flavor but not the other is hard to understand.

As simple as that.\n\nChristopher Fynn -- <cite>Haven’t we lost the plot?</cite>\n\nYes.  \nSince @font-face is not heavily used yet (is it used at all), it is not too late to agree on supporting only EOT rather than also TTF/OTF. It is be a clean solution, and with information given in the EOT header, services like TypeKit were mostly superfluous.  \nDiscussions -- including on www-style and www-font list -- do not make any sense to me. The funny thing is that my own position has changed thanks to said discussions. Before, I was all for plain TTF/OTF. But web guys' \"for free\" and \"-anti\" ideology and fabricated arguments showed me how they tick.  \nThe point is that EOT's header info expressly states who may use the font (by URL info as well as by EOT \"format\" itself which tells a OS \"that's not for you\") -- which additional information prevents abuse in the first place.

TV didn't stop over here in Europe when the Americans went on strike…\n\nMy point is that typeface designers, font developers, and font distributors are a diverse bunch, internationally scattered. Speaking for all of them would be difficult. There isn't a union, in the US or otherwise. The ATypI, which you might be able to call an international trade group, probably cannot speak authoritatively for all of the people who work with type worldwide, even if they would all be members (which is not the case, I suspect).\n\n"

And, if it is at all possible, from a \"political\" and \"public relations\" standpoint, a united front would be highly beneficial.  \nFor one reason only: I think it will help bring a speedier resolution of the \"problem\" of web fonts to the satisfaction of most stakeholders.\n\nLike I said, just my opinion, but it is based on a lot of hours looking at this issue unfold on a daily basis.\n\nThere is a symposium at TypeCon2009 on Sunday the 19th about web fonts. Perhaps some light will be shed there.\n\n"

      "content": "\"the difference between Store A and Store B\"\n\nB&M analogies aren't always ideal, but yours is pretty good. However, if I may, I think to fully equate the analogy to web fonts, we need a C option:\n\nstore A) commercial tools, but easy to shoplift if one desires. It's also very easy to legitimately purchase quickly and efficiently for those that like to buy their products legitimately.\n\nstore B) commercial tools, but difficult to shoplift if one desires. It's also a bit of a pain to purchase products as there are long lines, crowded parking, and that really annoying person that insists that they look in your card and put a smiley face on the receipt before you can leave since they don't trust any of their customers.\n\nfree bin C) commercial tools that have been left in boxes out behind the abandoned warehouse for anyone to take that wants them.\n\nI think those into getting software for free for the sake of getting it for free are fully aware of location C and use that most of the time (.ru sites, any number of newsgroups or bittorrent trackers, private file sharing groups, sendspace/yousendit/megadownload/etc). Some of these folks, if they can't find the tool they want at option C will go into store A and sneak it out in their coat.\n\nWhich leaves the question: What if Store A didn't exist? What would that group of people do if option C didn't have what they want? I see a few scenarios:\n\n1) They'd decide that it's not worth the effort to steal from store B and do nothing.\n\n2) They'd be determined to get it anyways and do what it takes to lift it from store B.\n\n3) They'd decide to pay money legitimately at store B.\n\nWhat percentage of people that rarely if ever pay for fonts would fit into each of those 3 groups? I don't know. Does getting rid of option A turn off some legitimate purchasers who no longer will bother as they don't want to deal with the hassle of store B? I don't know that either.\n\n\"It’s about the difference between having to defeat security using a font ripper browser plugin or just straight downloading from a URL.\"\n\nIMHO, I don't see a real difference there. In fact, I imagine the 'font ripper' plugin would ultimately be easier to use ('STEAL ANY FONTS ON THIS SITE' one click vs. VIEW SOURCE -\\> Find CSS URL -\\> View CSS -\\> find @font-face path -\\> Download font).\n\nAside from all of that, I do agree that a consensus needs to be formed sooner than later. Something that the type community can present to the W3C as their own proposal as a group.\n\n"
