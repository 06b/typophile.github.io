The ampersand could have come from a collection of ampersands like [these two fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124335/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/ampersands/) from Castle Type.\n\n",

But I don't think that means it's not Times. There are so many versions of this face--both authorized and unauthorized. It might also be pre-digital.   \n   \nIn any case, I am convinced that it is some version of Times.\n\n"
