I don't think the new poster is quite as strong, but it's still a refreshing change from the usual batch of headshots + type.\n\n",

      "content": "I really like that, its interesting not seeing a trailer without any scenes from the actual movie for a change. The transitions were really nice and the rework on the WB logo to match the preview looked good. The coordination with the music is also nice.   \n   \nThis is kind of good for inspiration for me at the moment as I have recently started fooling around with after effects.\n\n"

Motion graphics looks like so much fun. I wonder if it really is? I have After Effects and have used it a bit, but haven't done enough of it to tell.\n\n"
