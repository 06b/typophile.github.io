  "content": "Im working on some designs for a club night. One of my Ideas involved an 80's style Michael Jackson 'Thriller' album type font, the kind of text the was quite prominent in the 80's, with a slant on the text - almost hand written, often with a colour gradient and black out line. Does any one know of a font that would match this criteria? Any suggestions would be very welcome, Thanks alot.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215224006im_/http:/typophile.com/files/thriller2_4304.jpg)\n\n",
