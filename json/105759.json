WhatTheFont gave no results, and I tried other font recognition tools to identify it, with no result.  \n So you are my last hope :)  \nImages attached below are a screenshot of the Shutterstock file and the relevant font.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405152214im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-23%20at%2019_3767.03.44.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405152214im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-23%20at%2019_4574.22.35.png)\n\n",
