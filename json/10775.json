I think these are really quite elegant forms.   \n   \nI'm not sure if the little spiky cross strokes are really needed, so you might examine those if you decide to complete the font. At very least you might consider toning them down just a bit.   \n   \nThe overhang of the lc \"a\" might be a bit overprominent, too (or perhaps the bowl of the character is underprominent, considering the overall character width).   \n   \nI can see how some of the other glyphs might be especially fun to work out, based on the ground rules established by these characters.   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
