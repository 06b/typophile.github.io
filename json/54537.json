  "content": "A recent thread here pointed me in the direction of Doyald Young's work, and in an interview he says he does his pencil drawings on tracing paper and then scans them. I was also looking at photos of what I think was a workshop run by Ale Paul and again everyone seemed to be drawing on tracing paper. What are the advantages of this? I'm guessing you can lay a grid under the paper without needing to draw and then erase them on the paper. Also being able to see your design in reverse. Is there something else that I'm missing? I use tracing paper only rarely and that is purely for tracing.\n\nAlthough I was at art school in the late '80s my course was fine art and there weren't any design courses where I might have learnt about such techniques.\n\n",

I realise it is good for revising drawings later on, which is where I use it, but I thought there might have been a specific reason for doing a first draft on tracing paper rather than something more opaque.\n\n"
