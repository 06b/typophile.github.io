What is a good display face that communicates “engineering?” I’ve seen one that was outlined, visible rules for baseline, xheight, etc, and visible circles used to determine the geometry of the typeface. Now I can’t find it and my searches on the font websites is coming up short. Any ides?\n\nThanks,  \nScott\n\n",

The Leonardo I have on my machine is a handwritten font. Maybe I only have one of the family?\n\nSince I am only using two letters, I may just pick a geometric typeface and add the embelishments myself. Thought it’d be simple if I could just use a typeface though.\n\n"
