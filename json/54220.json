  "content": "I was curius what helvetica would look like with some ligatures, and couldn’t find any examples, so I decided to make my own. I made two versions, one is more linear based on the forms of the t and the second is more curvy based on the top of the s. I understand that this is purely ornamental, but I wanted to do some experimenting.\n\n[http://www.typeandglyph.com/2009/01/deservedly-rare/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184224/http:/www.typeandglyph.com/2009/01/deservedly-rare/ \"http://www.typeandglyph.com/2009/01/deservedly-rare/\")\n\nHas anyone else seen any good examples of helvetica ligatures.\n\n",
