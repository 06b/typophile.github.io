The monoline script looks familiar, the roman reminds me a bit of Electra, but of course isn't.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks\n\nRichard\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013163410im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Roman_4041.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013163410im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MonolineScript_5162.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "The serif looks somewhat similar to a typeface called De Vinne No. 11, however the G is quite different. Most of the lower case looks quite similar, although the weight of No. 11 is a bit too heavy and maybe slightly wider than this sample. I saw this in the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\".\n\nMcGrew shows DeVinne Roman done by Frederic Goudy at the end of the 19th century, and except for the G it also seems quite close (and even a better weight match) to this sample.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
