  "content": "Hi. Trying to restore an old coffee Gaggia espresso machine...  \nI'm trying to get as close to the original font of the \"coffee\" part as possible.\n\nMy machine is too worn on the outside (I can barely see where the big \"GAGGIA\" was)\n\nAttached is the best photo I could find and a 400% blow up where I tried to make it more identifiable. (corrected perspective and high contrast) identyfont and whathefont where frustrating to use.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [coffee-400.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714213112/http:/typophile.com/files/coffee-400.jpg) | 54.36 KB |\n\n",

It's made of pure geometry (look at the bad curve-to-line transitions, and the overly small aperture of the \"A\"); the good news is that makes it easy to reproduce.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Mainly because I don't have the original and the images I could find are low resolution.\n\n@defiatone: I tried Franklin Gothic. Franklin Gothic Demi comes surprisingly close. That's one typeface I wouldn't have tried. Thanks! It's not quite right, though\n\nI'm wondering about those cuts at the ends of the \"c\"... Could that be a part of the original font?\n\n"
