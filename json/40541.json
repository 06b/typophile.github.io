I write quite a few forewords for friends featuring font topics (those were six alliterations), like for Rian Hughes’ book or House Industries etc. But now and again I actually write more than a few sentences. Sorry about the sloppy editing on my part, but these things normally get sent out in an email late at night without sleeping on it and going back to clean up both typos and style in the morning.\n\n"
