Or is it something you have to solve by yourself using PHP, etc?\n\nOn top of that... any suggestion for a particular company?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nR.\n\n",

      "content": "There are all-in-one services for Electronic Software Distribution (ESD) that do the credit card thing as well as providing the download (link). They charge a bit more than services that do just the credit card transaction, though.\n\nI am using PayPal, where it is called \"Instant Payment Notification\" (IPN). You have to implement the ESD yourself with PHP but it's not too difficult. Have a look at their documentation and sample PHP code.\n\n"

      "content": "Ramiro,\n\nWhatever is your final CC processing solution, may I suggest that you incorporate some sort of e-mail verification before allowing the download. Our payment gateway is set up to send a verification e-mail to the purchaser. The purchaser then has to follow an activation link and re-enter their username and password. Since installing this system, we have had no cases of CC fraud.\n\nIf you allow a direct download after processing the CC you are asking for trouble.\n\nJames\n\n"
