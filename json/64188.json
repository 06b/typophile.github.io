To kick this off, I would like to post my absolute favorite site, [Font squirrel.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131141552/http:/www.fontsquirrel.com/). Check it out and post what you think are great free sites. Also, post what licenses this site primarily deals with (commercial, CreativeCommons, Demo, etc.). Looking forward to see what shows up.\n\n",
