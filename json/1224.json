Here's a look at these numbers in the Medium weight: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-humana-serif/humana-serif-itc-medium/testdrive.html?s=261-7711&p=48](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518050956/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-humana-serif/humana-serif-itc-medium/testdrive.html?s=261-7711&p=48)   \n   \nSee the resemblance in the basic letterforms?\n\n"

      "content": "I would like to suggest that this scoring system overlooks the difficulty factor. I think the points should be based only on the number of guesses made, not on the time it takes. That factor is already considered when you award points to the first one who names the font correctly, but if three or four tries are needed then it seems more points should be awarded, because of the difficulty in making the correct identification.   \nOtherwise you are favoring the person with the fastest server, or the most time to just sit and wait for new posts. By the time I see the first e-mail that there is a new font posted for ID, there are already three posts with it to ID the thing, so of course I would like a system that puts a bit less emphasis on speed.   \nJust my two cents. :-)\n\n"
