The Golden Bus Company typeface is the first I've transfered from sketches to screen (still need to transfer the lowercase sketches).   \n   \nI was reading a book called 'The Wrong Way Home' by Peter Moore which covers his travels from London to Sydney overland (along the old hippy trail), and one part of the journey involves travelling across Pakistan on colourful buses, the pictures this put in my head were the starting point for the font.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017061537im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15132.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "I'm partial to the second or fourth A.   \n   \nI like the beginnings of the lowercase, particularly a and k. r and c stick out, though; r has a huge gap underneath it (maybe you can tweak your fishtail terminals to alleviate that - retracting the upper portion and extending the lower) and the serifs in c break the counter into two. Also, in f and t the repetition of terminals creates this confusing sawtooth effect (I suspect that you could preserve your feel while alleviating this by using single-lobed terminals with the same characteristic 'fin' shape). e also catches my eye for its thin strokes - how would a more open variant, with a diagonal crossbar perhaps, work out? It seems to be a very linear character for a distinctly circular face.   \n   \nQuibble: The P is inconsistent with B and R. Deliberate?\n\n"
