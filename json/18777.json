  "content": "Hi,\n\nI recently started selling fonts on the myfonts.com website and after a month the owner of the site asked me if I could change some values of the truetype versions of my fonts: \"...the TrueType versions of your fonts will need to be updated. For this the value of fsType in the OS/2 table needs to be set to 4.\"  \nI use Fontlab 5 and I searched for a spot/field where I could change these values, but I cant find them at all. I have no experience with these things so I would really appreciate someone telling me where I can make these changes.\n\nThanks,  \nJoe\n\n",

Caution: note that for Restricted License embedding to take effect, it must be the only level of embedding selected (as noted in the previous paragraph).\n\nPreview & Print embedding (0x0004): Fonts with this bit set indicate that they may be embedded within documents but must only be installed temporarily on the remote system. Any document which includes a Preview & Print embedded font must be opened “read-only;” the application must not allow the user to edit the document; it can only be viewed and/or printed.\n\nEditable embedding (0x0008): Fonts with this bit set indicate that they may be embedded in documents, but must only be installed temporarily on the remote system. In contrast to Preview & Print fonts, documents containing Editable fonts may be opened “read-write;” editing is permitted, and changes may be saved.\n\nInstallable embedding (0x0000): Fonts with this setting indicate that they may be embedded and permanently installed on the remote system by an application. The user of the remote system acquires the identical rights, obligations and licenses for that font as the original purchaser of the font, and is subject to the same end-user license agreement, copyright, design patent, and/or trademark as was the original purchaser\n\n"
