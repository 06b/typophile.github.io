  "content": "Hi everyone my name is Neil, Graphic designer in Australia. I have been reading the forum for a while and it is nice to meet you all\n\nI am doing some research for a design blog. “Oh not another one!” you say. Well it won’t be, it will not be covering the same rehashed crap that is on a lot of design blogs at the moment. I can’t stress this enough.\n\nI would like to find out what YOU would like to read on a design blog. What would benefit you?\n\nHere are some of my ideas so far . . .\n\n\\* Interviews with real world designers  \n \\* Reviews on hardware from a designer’s perspective  \n \\* Reviews on games/software from a designer’s perspective  \n \\* Design Process of my work and others  \n \\* In-depth articles with good examples  \n \\* A source for upcoming design events/conferences around the world  \n \\* Humour added into articles, e.g. funny captions, comics  \n \\* Design related tutorials e.g. getting a design job to software (video, audio, article)  \n \\* Writing about a topic from a different angle (if beneficial)\n\nI want quality over quantity, articles that will truly benefit the design community.  \nLet me know what you like, what you don’t like and any other ideas you were hoping to read.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

There are more than enough boring new design blogs, I assume most of the started with a very similar list.
