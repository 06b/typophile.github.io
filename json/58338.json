  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm finishing up a large font family and will make instances from my multiple master font of the weights inbetween my masters. This works just fine, but... it doesn't interpolate the kerning pairs. More than that, there are NO kerning pairs in my new MM font.  \nI've got about 900 kerning pairs in my masters. I did a class based kerning which looks just fine to me.  \nPeter Bruhn told me that the both masters should have exactly the same kerning pairs, otherwise no kerning is interpolated? Is this true?\n\nDoes anyone know why the kerning date isn't interpolated and how to correct this?\n\nthnx,  \n®ené\n\n",

Otherwise the odd pairs will not be interpolated.\n\nWhen you say there are NO kerning pairs in your new MM font, what do you mean? Were you not taking out instances FROM an MM-font?\n\n"

Fixing those little things can add up to a good deal of wasted time. As someone who still has a lot to learn about type design this is especially irritating because I really need to focus on problems with my type and not problems with my software. But I have never had problems with Superpolator as long as my paths and nodes match up, which is pretty easy to do with the compare script that Erik provides.\n\n_James, does Superpolator do the job correctly even if the kerning pairs and/or kerning classes don’t match?_\n\nSuperpolator assumes all missing pairs to be zero, so values still get interpolated.\n\n"
