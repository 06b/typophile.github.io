  "content": "Some friends and I plan on watching _Helvetica_ (again!) this Friday and eating typographic foods. So far, we plan on making alphabet soup with alphabet crackers, followed by alphabet cookies.\n\nThere is [chocolate type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023193829/http:/typolade.de/), but I don't think we have the time or funds for that unless we cast it ourselves.\n\nTypographic fluids will be one issue. The only solution I can find is [ice](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023193829/http:/www.google.com/products?q=letter+ice+tray&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=68rQSceBGurplQeXg4zyCQ&sa=X&oi=product_result_group&resnum=1&ct=title).\n\nI'd love to see what other typographic foods are available.\n\n",
