I made a logo for a dude about a year ago, and since then I've restructured my entire font library and I can't seem to recall which font I used here:\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120249im_/http:/i.imgur.com/Zn311Dv.png)\n\nI know it was an opentype \"small caps\" set, so it's relatively modern.
