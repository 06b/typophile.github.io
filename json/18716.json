  "content": "Pardon this newcomer if this is a question that has been asked all too many times, but what do you all think will be the next big thing in typography?\n\n..and maybe more interestingly, what would you WANT to be the next big thing in typography?\n\nOh, and it doesn’t have to be related to any one specific aspect of typography either. It can be about technology, tools, specific design styles, printing techniques, etc. etc. Anything you can think of relating to the world of typography, really.\n\nLooking forward to some interesting answers!\n\n [‹ InDesign Tip - Forgot to save a document?

Something like “contextual” adjustments to glyph shape, kerning, letterspacing, etc., to the point that, say, whole words or phrases could be helped into line “just so.” Not to “automate” the art of the typographer, but to help and to open up possibilities (that’s what technology is for, right?).\n\nIn any case, hasn’t the whole “randomness” thing been done?

But I think that many of the typefaces done for newspapers and magazines now have these capacities. Look at the catalogues of Font Bureau and Hoefler & Frere-Jones—leading suppliers of these fonts—for many, many examples. The Fontfont catalogue has many also, like Meta.\n\nWhen you say ’multi-purpose’ are you saying that Helvetica is a good text font for extended text in small sizes in print? I really don’t think it is. Where did I read that Paul Rand told an employee of his not to set text in Helvetica? When the employee asked ’Why?’ he said, ’Because it looks like dog sh\\*t in text.’\n\nI know I have repeated too many times that the combination of wide counters and tight spacing hurts readablility, but I haven’t seen any counter-examples yet.\n\n"

They’re worth it.\n\nOne more thought from a different view point: I personally have found that with the hobbies I have, once I start taking money for doing something, it takes a lot of the fun out if it, and puts more pressure on me. For free I can simply do my best and the people have got their money’s worth. I am flute player (with electronic effects) and play for the fun of it. But I am able to fool people into thinking I am pretty good. And was recently making $8,000 a year playing a couple nights a week (coincidentally this was about the last time I could regularly afford to buy fonts). But I noticed that I was never satisfied with how I did, whereas \\*before\\* money was involved I’d do just as well and think: Yeah! That was fun!\n\nBut when I play for free there are musicians that get mad at me for taking the job away from a “pro” musician. Fact is I have never seen another musician do what I do anyway. Should I never get to do what I love to do because I don’t want money for it?\n\nSame thing happens when someone asks me to help them with a graphics kind of thing. I am never satisfied and fiddle with it for so long there is no way anyone could possibly pay me for my time.\n\nPerhaps if I felt I knew what I was doing, it would help, but I am almost always winging it. It is, perhaps, the story of my life.\n\n"

Reading through this thread I see some asking for typographers and type designers to be recognised as quality professionals and asking for more money and yet supporting the use of stock houses.  \nWhat is wrong with stock photography?\n\nPerhaps the following article written by world respected illustrator Brad Holland can answer that question better than I can.\n\nGive Us Your Work and We’ll Take Your Clients  \nby Brad Holland\n\nThe Gospel according to stock is that the bulk of stock house business comes from sales to clients who have previously used photography. There’s no proof for this. We’re supposed to take their word for it. But it’s crucial to the stockman that illustrators believe it. We all know they’re getting clients from somewhere. And if they’re not taking them from photographers, they’re taking them from us. That’s why they claim they’re “expanding” the market for illustration. How many of us would pay them to take pictures on consignment if they said, “Give us your work and we’ll take your clients?”\n\nBut read an interview published in the September 1997 issue of Photo District News. There, you’ll get a frank explanation of how a stockman works. In it, the CEO of a major stock photo house explains how they successfully lured clients away from freelancers. According to Henry Scanlon of the Comstock photo agency, their “goal” was to convince art directors to use stock for commercial assignments. To do this they had to persuade them to call the stock house instead of photographers when they needed work.\n\nUsing direct mail, they “hammered away at the market.” They flooded clients with catalogues. And, “after a long struggle,” they created a “position” for stock that, he frankly admits, “decimated” the ranks of assignment photographers.\n\nThis particular CEO can afford to be blunt now. He’s branched out from stock into clip photos. And like other clip art sellers, he knows he’s no longer dependent on photographers. A clip-art-man, he says, will “have no trouble” finding hungry photographers willing to “flood the market with cliches.”\n\nAnd what about the photographers he lured out of assignment work?  \nWell, now he can say it: They were hacks, “mere technicians,” in his words, willing to do nothing more than copy the work of other photographers. And just as stock “decimated” assignment photography, now royalty free photos will “decimate” them.  \nAs for stock photographers, he suggests they “go to night school” and find a new line of work. And good riddance, too. Disposing of the hacks, he says, will open up room at the top for “real photographers”. The stockman sees himself as a cat that is ridding the house of mice.  \nThe stockmeisters of illustration will say this happened in stock photography. They’ll say it won’t happen here. You’re welcome to believe them if you like. But can you doubt they’re following a similar strategy?\n\nIf stock illustration houses “decimate” the ranks of artists, it will surely leave room at the top for “real illustrators.” Those with superior talent, and resourcefulness and those who enjoy name recognition will no doubt continue as elite craftsmen. But what business can consider itself healthy that has room at the top for only a handful of well-paid professionals and room at the bottom for a gypsy workforce of grunt laborers, desperate enough to do whatever work a stockman doles out.\n\nWe can’t presume to read the minds of the stock merchants who are now soliciting work from artists. We can’t know how sincere they are when they contact you to say that they’ve been following your career and they think you’re ready for stock. Credit them, if you like, with the best of intentions. But remember that when you give a stock house your pictures, you give them your clients. And there’s nothing in the contract you sign that says they ever have to give your clients back.\n\n"
