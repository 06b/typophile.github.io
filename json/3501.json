      "content": "bj, I'm almost positive that the titles for seven were done on film. There's a variety of techniques to do this, but I would guess that the copy (both type and handwritten) was printed negative on photo-composition film, a strong source of light projected on the back, and filmed (16 or likely 35 mm) from the front; using any kind of transparent distorting device (a loupe, a drinking glass, a piece of plastic,...) in front of the lens to achieve the light distortion look.   \n   \nFilming at different speeds will give you also a variety of effects.   \n   \nThe final touches, I'm sure, will be added in After Effects, where you can composite the filmed stuff whith the digital photoshop rendering of the same type if you want to, and then with the actual footage that, in seven's case, was shot specifically for the open.   \n   \nYou can, of course, do all this in the computer, but there's nothing that can compare to the richness and the randomness of using real film.\n\n"

      "content": "As I remember from the article I read, the whole sequence was optically composited, the way it would have been done 20+ years ago. Film positives, negatives, etc were all put together and filmed by the title designer. It may have been color timed on an Avid, but certainly there was no use of After Effects.   \n   \nI'm sure you could come close to duplicating the effect now in AE, but I still think it's cooler that it was done by hand.\n\n"
