Could we set it up so that after login I’m redirected back to the page I came from so I can then comment?\n\n [‹ indesign clipping path](http://web.archive.org/web/20080404214343/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17702 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Learning Adobe Creative Suite 2 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080404214343/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17712 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
