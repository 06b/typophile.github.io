      "content": " **The Aftermath**\n\nThe evening started out quietly enough. We slowly assembled at the only round table in the north room, but it quickly overflowed. So we moved to a larger assemblage of tables, leaving our little round table for a group of pirates. (I tried to engage their leader in hearty pirate-talk but I mustn't have had the accent right...all I got was vague eye-rolling.) (And further, I didn't espy a jug o rum amongst the group of em, so I don't think they were real pirates anyway.)\n\nAs Linda indicated, 10 people participated and at times there were 5 different conversations going! We were loud. And unabashedly type-oriented. We drowned out those pirates in the corner, celebrating our own Talk-Like-A-Type-Geek evening. There are no photos so you'll have to take my word for it.\n\nFirst (serious) bit of business was to continue the debate about picking a name for our group. Our short-list from the previous meeting immediately got thrown out and a whole new list was drawn up. Dan Reynolds suggests we adopt the venerable \"Typostammtisch\" used by Berlin and Frankfurt. Other suggestions include some variation of \"Type Club\" or \"Calgary Typographic Society\". The debate still continues and will be a part of our next meeting. Whatever the name, we all like the idea of referring to ourselves as \"Typos\".\n\nShow & Tell was hugely successful. Most people brought something typographic to share and pass around the table.\n\nMike Kerr showed us work he has been doing illustrating letters. His presentation included painted originals of individual letters, a finished piece with assembled words, and his sketchbook showing the evolution of many forms. Boisterous conversation changed to ooohs and aaahs. His work can be seen on his website.\n\n[http://www.wronghand.com/mike/mikesite.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017020827/http:/www.wronghand.com/mike/mikesite.html \"http://www.wronghand.com/mike/mikesite.html\")\n\nMostly, we were too busily engaged in type-talk to follow any meeting-like formality. So we continued our conversations and enjoyed the evening.\n\n"
