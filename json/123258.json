  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've taken on a menu design project for a semi-formal Chinese restaurant and am in need of some suggestions.\n\nI'm trying to stray away from obvious Asian-stereotypical fonts, but rather something classic and clean with a slight hint of Asian influence.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Right now I am pairing Century Gothic with Palatino italic and while they are quite nice together, they're giving a much more western (perhaps an Italian restaurant) vibe.\n\n",
