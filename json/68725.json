  "content": "This is from an essay by Firmin Didot published in 1783 and set in his Cicero italic (12 point) - a text where, supposedly, Firmin shows his mother the peculiarities of the typeface. There's an interesting treatment of the lowercase v - when paired with a, like in the word \"avez\", it gets a different shape. Like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111216182535im_/http:/typophile.com/files/didot_italic01_5394.jpg)\n\nThe v in \"vous\" is the standard shape; the one in \"avez\" is the contextual glyph, narrower and without the left top tail. The reason seems to be having an homogeneous kerning. I wonder if other typographers ever applied such a trick. Below is attached the full page from the Italic essay.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [didot\\_italic02.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111216182535/http:/typophile.com/files/didot_italic02_0.jpg) | 349.47 KB |\n\n",

So in Didot's intention the \"contextual\" lowercase v glyph was probably the first letter in a word; indeed, the narrow v is also used in other words:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111216182535im_/http:/typophile.com/files/didot_italic03_6028.jpg)\n\n"

I have yet to do this but I expect that she is right about this. However I will be looking at them quite soon to see if they bear on my work.\n\nIn the meantime here are my contextual v shapes from my not yet released Reading MATD type - Arrotino.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111216182535im_/http:/typophile.com/files/v_4203.gif)\n\nThe blue portion at the serifs is the portion contextually removed. The middle one has a bit of both sides removed because it has two diagonal neighbors and the ones on the left and right just the the side next to a diagonal letter. All the diagonals in Arrotino roman have this behaviour when set against a fellow diagonal (y, v, w and x). The idea is to be able to present the letter optimally in all contexts. The example shown is unlikely to be a final solution for this letter as it was put together fairly quickly - more in order to test the code to control it than as a matter of highly deliberate letter design. Still, could a little thing like that make a difference? I think it can - yes.\n\n"

The style is derived -- more directly than most types -- from 18th century formal cursive writing, but I'm forced to make a pointed rather than a rounded _v_ because the rounded form is a separate letter in IPA and some orthographies. My default _v_ is quite similar to the Didot initial form, which of course causes spacing or collision problems when following some other letters. I probably won't use the variant form after every letter, though, only after those in which problems occur.\n\n"
