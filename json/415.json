This includes electronic forms.   \n   \nThere is an provision to the copyright law known as the \"fair use\" exception which allows for some copying without permission for cases of criticism, reporting, teaching, and scholarship. These exceptions, however, do not generally allow for the copying and distribution of an entire work.   \n   \nSo if you wanted to create and distribute a digital \"reprint\" of Moye's book, you'd need to get permission first.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

      "content": "I had a discussion with a big wig at the publishing company that bought MIS Press. They have no intention of reprinting the book and they have no intention to allow permission to copy the books contents in any format even though a copy of the book cannot be located.   \n   \nWhat's frustrating is that the book is very very good and as relevant today as it was when it was written due to Fontographer not seeing an update in lo these many years.   \n   \nI wrote several e-mails to Stephen with no reply and I'm not sure if there is any way to share the fantastic information that is contained within this book. Any ideas? It's as good as you think it is.   \n   \nFunny side note, I found a copy of the book on eBay right after as the auction ended and the seller was thrilled to get $15 for what he felt was \"dry and bording\"   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

Hopefully, Mr. Moye will negotiate a better contract next time.   \n   \nStuart: The information in the book is not copyrightable -- that is, the ideas are not protected, just the actual expression of them. You can share the same ideas in your own words with your own examples. Mr. Moye could re-express the same ideas in new ways and possibly publish a new book on the same topic (with another publisher, undoubtedly).   \n   \nThere is, of course, a gray area where new expression of old ideas and plagiarism meet. My point is, just because a bull-headed publisher refuses to reprint (which I can understand) or to give permission (which I can't necessarily agree with) doesn't mean that the information is lost or trapped.   \n   \nDisclaimer: I'm not a copyright attorney, nor have I ever played one on TV.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

For example, re-publish the work on a site of a political entity that doesn't have a copyright agreement with the US. Failing that, on a site of a country that does have a treaty, but also happens to have enough bigger problems that they would never come after you. This includes most countries on this planet.   \n   \nThe letter of the law must not be allowed to overpower decent behavior.   \n   \nHOWEVER, you need to make sure that:   \n1. Your guerilla action is motivated by unreasonable behavior on their part, and not simply because you don't have the mettle to do things legitimately.   \n2.
