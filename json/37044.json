I love the clean simple look - love the ’u’.\n\nThanks in advance  \n~Andy\n\n [‹ care to suggest a typeface?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071227152901/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37051 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font too small for screen? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071227152901/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36957 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The source code on similicio.us references a css style sheet in this line:\n\n_link href=”sim.css” rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css”_\n\nSo, simply add sim.css to the end of the url, like this:\n\n_http://similicio.us/sim.css_\n\nThen, find the “h1” style attributed to the font you’re looking for.\n\nViola!\n\n[Eileen Burke Graphic Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20071227152901/http:/www.eileenburke.org/)\n\n"
