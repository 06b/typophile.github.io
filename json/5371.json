(Autotechnica for one)... it's on the back of many GM cars in Australia, ranging from 1987-1997 (possibly later), I've seen about 6 different models, all with the same lettering...   \n   \nI'm hoping it wasn't made exclusively for them, but god knows... here is the image... any help would be greatly appreciated,\n\n<center> <br> &lt;img&gt; <br>\n</center>   \n   \nThanks guys, and Cheers, Glen. \n",

That said, there may well be a font that looks something like this, but I think it's unlikely that they used a font to create this particular nameplate.\n\n"

I was dreading that it was a custom creation, but if anyone could give suggestions on a similar design, I'd be more than greatful.   \n   \nthere are about 6-7 models of car, with this lettering on each, so i guess it could come down to scanning the badges, and creating a font out of it. while I don't have access to all of the letters, I have most, so i guess it's better than nothing.   \n   \nCheers,   \nGlen.\n\n"
