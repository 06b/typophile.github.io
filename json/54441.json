      "content": "I am pretty sure I searched for this when it was first posted. It was not in the ClickArt Handwritten fonts collection, which often has a lot of these amateur-looking printed fonts. One distinctive aspect of this font is that it was made to include Swedish accents, which most such fonts rarely have. It also has what I consider to be a distinctly European J. So I suspect either a European freebie font (I believe I checked Dafont already in February), or a custom font made for the magazine. As I have said hundreds of times, this style of font can be made by anyone, and very cheaply, so custom is not a big deal.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

No luck.\n\nIt's possible it is a commercial font, but it seems less likely to me than a free one, because frankly, there's not much reason for people to pay for something when so many free fonts would be so close they would be hard to tell apart.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
