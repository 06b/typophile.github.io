It’s very common with packaging like this to see a brand mark that starts out from an off-the-shelf font (in this case Caxton), and then gets modified, sometimes before it hits the shelves, sometimes over a period of years. Part of the reason is so that the brand has a unique identity, something that can’t be easily replicated with an off-the-shelf font. I don’t think you will find a closer match than Caxton.\n\n"
