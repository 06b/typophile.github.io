I don't know whether it's the same font as used in title-bars etc. in Mac OSX, but I just need the one from the buttons ;).\n\nIn case someone's reading this thread and doesn't have a Mac, here's a screenshot: [http://www.robinkanters.nl/macosx-buttons.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015132020/http:/www.robinkanters.nl/macosx-buttons.png \"http://www.robinkanters.nl/macosx-buttons.png\")\n\nThanks in advance!  \nRobin Kanters\n\n",
