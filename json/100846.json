  "content": "So I have this idea for a font, but I don't know if it's already been done before. I want to atach some scans of some of the rough sketches of the alphabet for it, but I'm paranoid that someone will steal my idea. How would I find out if my idea has been done already? I try to search for keywords regarding the font, but I dont think its good enough. Should I just make the font anyway?\n\n",

      "content": "Such risks come with the territory. And anyway people can copy your idea and do a better job selling it, so it's sort of moot... Plus if you make your idea public you have a weapon against plagiarism, since you can establish a date (although you won't really have Proof).\n\nWhat you might do is develop the idea enough to have a big head start, then show it to get feedback.\n\nhhp\n\n"
