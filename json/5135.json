      "content": "Something related to this just came up on the TYPO-L list. Somebody wanted to know what typeface was used in the Strand Magazine where Arthur Conan Doyle's stories first ran. You can look at the discussion [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524123150/http:/listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0406&L=typo-l&T=0&F=&S=&P=1571). The conclusion was that best modern equivalent of the Strand type would be either [Old Style 7](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524123150/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/old-style-7/) or [Monotype Old Style](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524123150/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205352). Of course, this is just one idea.\n\n"
