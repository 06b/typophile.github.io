I have done a font for a company and it doesn't work in InDesign..   \nHere's what he's saying:   \n   \n\"The font problems seem mostly to be occurring when printing from   \nAdobe InDesign. They are post script errors which cause the documents   \nnot to print at all from our rip. To get a printable result we are   \nforced to create a pdf from the document and then print from that. We   \nsuspect that there may be loose ends and/or open paths in some of the   \ncharacters\"   \n   \nSo now I wonder what shall I do to make it work?   \nI have made the font in Default Encoding (and also tried Adobe Encoding), Kerning & Metrics. TTF\n\n",
