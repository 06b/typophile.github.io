      "content": "Hi Billy\n\nStephen's right. There ain't no magic number.\n\nThe closest you might come to a pre-set formula is the (factory set) default value for auto leading in Adobe InDesign and Quark XPress – 120% of the type size. In other words if you set 10pt type the leading will measure 12pt from baseline to baseline. That's only two points extra to the body size – almost certainly too tight for sans serif faces, and not necessarily ideal for the majority of the serif faces either; I advise my students NOT to use auto leading.\n\n"

X-heights, ascenders, descenders, style of the typeface, weight of the typeface, and the personality of the typeface are all factors. The secret is optical adjusting.\n\n"

For example, what should the suggested leading be for:  \n_Adobe Garamond_  \n \\* at 8-point with 52 chars/line?  \n \\* at 10-point with 52 chars/line?  \n \\* at 12-point with 52 chars/line?  \n \\* at 8-point with 26 chars/line?  \n \\* at 10-point with 26 chars/line?  \n \\* at 12-point with 26 chars/line?  \n_Gill Sans_  \n \\* at 8-point with 52 chars/line?  \n \\* at 10-point with 52 chars/line?  \n \\* at 12-point with 52 chars/line?  \n \\* at 8-point with 26 chars/line?  \n \\* at 10-point with 26 chars/line?  \n \\* at 12-point with 26 chars/line?\n\nOuch, my nerdliness is REALLY showing.\n\n--Michael.\n\n------------------------------------------------------  \n// love what you do or do something else. //  \nMichael Ebert -- graphic designer, jazz saxophonist, horror movie devotee  \n------------------------------------------------------\n\n"

How loosely or tightly the letter and word spacing is also has an effect.\n\nGenerally, there are too many variables and with computers and laser printers it is easy to test different samples. So I agree with Stephen. Just test it.\n\nOh, and leading is a critical factor in readablity, so all the more reason to test it in each case.\n\n"

Also we have to consider the specific typeface's rythm and weight (for example didones requiring greater leading than garaldes) and also letterspacing as William pointed.\n\nI think that a list for a specific typeface like the one that Michael suggests or a loose formula for specific type styles (garalde, didone, modern, grotesque sans, etc) are the most feasible.\n\nHéctor\n\n"

I'm sure that most of you have a method that you use in order to find the best leading. „It has to look right.” Of course, but what does right look like. What should you look for? I would really appreciate if someone took the time to describe a method like this and really exemplify how the leading should be modified on different criteria. How to achieve that balance between the lines of letters and the lines of space.\n\nThere are guidelines that tell you to have the linespace grater than the wordspace, but not having it too big or the lines will fall apart. But how does this translate in relation to the inner spacing and such? When is the leading too small? When is it to big? I would like to be able to answer these questions just by looking at the way that the different spacings relate to one another, but I don't know how to check this.\n\n"

It still wouldn't yield perfect results in all circumstances, but as a rule-of-thumb for a first cut at typical body copy, with all the usual qualifications, it might work.\n\nI suppose the idea would be that Caslon and Jenson don't need leading, and other typefaces need as much leading as makes up for the missing height in their ascenders and descenders.\n\nHowever, if the x-height is given as a ratio between x-height and cap height, you still need the ratio between cap height and point size.\n\n"
