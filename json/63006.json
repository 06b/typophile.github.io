As soon as the kerning and autospacing are being finished, it will hopefully find its place on the market.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo1_4933.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo2_5802.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo3_4736.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo9_3827.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo5_5360.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo4_6323.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo55_5531.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo6_4005.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo7_4773.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo8_6477.jpg)\n\nHope you like it.

      "content": "- Do the rounds have any overshoot? \"o\", \"e\" and such look small to me.  \n- The caps seem more unfinished than the lc, also in terms of divergent curve character and widths (doesn't that \"QUARED\" look a bit strange?)  \n- I see some clogging issues in joins, especially in the Thin version, but also the Regular. You might try to compensate/thin/taper more.  \n- The spacing needs a lot of work. :-\\ Your glyphs can be as pretty as they want – the spacing really makes or breaks a font.\n\nI'd say if you spend some more time polishing this, you can make it \\*really\\* nice (as opposed to quite interesting for a first/early one).&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)\n\n"

      "content": "Really interesting!  \nI really like the lc. nuy are too large though. u has too be less wide than n too (on average over 40 fonts I surveyed it is 2%) ; f and t are too narrow as almost always with a first font. m & w look too similar and w is too empty at the top.  \nThere are many spacing issues. The rounds may need to overshoot slightly more.  \nJ is really strange. The bar of the A could be lower. The R is a bit out of proportion with the rest. M is too narrow. Check the width of each stem and joints, they seem to vary too much.\n\nHTH, let me know if it does not or if you think that I am wrong.\n\n"
