  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis is a logo that I'm working on for my church (translated from Romanian as Independent Baptist Church). I’d greatly appreciate your input in this design.\n\nSome additional information: the church is conservative, yet friendly. The “tagline” to go with the logo is “Building on the Word” (a reference to the Bible, obviously). The font I’m currently using is Amerigo BT.\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nDan\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019095001im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_abib_6310.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_abib.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019095001/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_abib.jpg) | 59.1 KB |\n\n",

Since all the letters are connected,my eyes want to see the letters spaced a little further apart. I had to read it twice before I actually figured out what it said. Something about the N and A forms an M to me\n\n"

      "content": "Andrew,\n\nThank you for your comment. Do you think Amerigo is not a suitable choice for the logo? If so, what would you recommend? I will try to space out the letters a bit and repost the image. It’s interesting that you were unable to figure out what it said at first glance. Of course, you don’t know the language, but this gives me valuable insight.\n\nDan\n\n"

This is a \"quick fix\".\n\nJonathan, thank you for pointing that also.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019095001im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_abib_4139.jpg)\n\nI'd say the most important thing in the logo is the open book - I'd like to keep that concept. If it creates too many problems around the N and the A next to it, I'd rather try to find a different face, than scrap the book idea.\n\n"
