  "content": "Hello,\n\nI've lurked here for a looong time and finally decided to set-up my account. I'm looking for fonts that have round O's and \"stiff\" capitals as seen in the logo of [http://www.fhoke.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301011612/http:/www.fhoke.com/ \"http://www.fhoke.com\").\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301011612im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logoFhoke_5531.gif)\n\nI've been scouring my small collection and MyFonts for a bit and I can't seem to find any. Suggestions? Thanks! FF\n\nP.S I know the correct term is not \"stiff\", what kind of font is that considered?\n\n",
