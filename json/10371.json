  "content": "These are scans from a book called _The Problem of the Media_, by Robert McChesney, published 2004. I tried Identifont to no avail. It seems very familiar but I can't put my finger on it. I don't know if it has small caps, but they aren't used in the book. OsFs are, but they are a little darker than the rest of the text, which I thought was strange. Anyway, here goes...   \n   \n ![McChesney1](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018043125im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69958.jpg)   \n   \n ![McChesney2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018043125im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69959.jpg)   \n   \n ![McChesney3](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018043125im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69960.jpg)   \n   \nIt isn't as noticeable on screen, but in the actual physical book the figures appear much darker than everything else, almost as if it's a bold weight. My wife is trying to go to sleep and is not well pleased with my noise-making, so good night.\n\n",
