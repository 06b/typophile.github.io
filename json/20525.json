I know Tony Stan gets ripped here every now and then (mainly for ITC Garamond) but this looks nice if you prefer a more sedate Goudy font. Has anyone else tried this out?\n\n [‹ wich typeface is this one?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813163212/http:/typophile.com/node/20634 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typophile: Feature request / wish list ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813163212/http:/typophile.com/node/19295 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I had a client once who’s identity guidelines required Berkeley Old Style set at 85% width with -40 tracking. It was beyond painful to read. By contrast, the regualar setting of started to look really nice. They also used Avenir with 115% width. Anyway, the “Pro” version just looks like they bundled it up into opentype format.\n\nDoes Tony Stan remind anyone else of Iron Man?\n\n"

And I use the word “sedate” because it’s much more homogenized than the real Goudy font — not nearly as unique.\n\nThis is the first time it’s had small caps and osf, right?\n\n"

If you want something with that Goudy warmth but less assertive—with the slanted ’e’—then Berkeley is good. It is well drawn and sets very smoothly.\n\nBy the way, the slanted crossbar is not Victorian, but Renaissance—Jenson.\n\n"
