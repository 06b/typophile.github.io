  "content": "Hi there!\n\nFirst off, this is my first foray into attempting to create a font or toying with fonts in general. I’ve been interested in how all this works for some time, but never really delved into it until recently.\n\nI have been asked to create a custom handwriting font for one of my clients so that they can use it for custom graphics and other things I will be creating for a new site and some album artwork I will be designing.\n\nMy basic problem is that the fonts like B’s and P’s and D’s are being filled in by ‘black globs’ and I am not sure how to fix this problem.\n\nI have the following screenshots so you can see what I am dealing with:  \n [Overall Font as it looks in FontExpert font viewer](http://web.archive.org/web/20051001072136/http:/www.mbstia.com/testing/fontexpert.jpg)\n\n[Font outline in Fontographer](http://web.archive.org/web/20051001072136/http:/www.mbstia.com/testing/boutline.jpg)\n\n[Font ‘Preview’ in Fontographer](http://web.archive.org/web/20051001072136/http:/www.mbstia.com/testing/bpreview.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, in the outline it looks as it should with the ‘holes’ in the  \n“B” where the should be. But then if you view the preview the entire B is filled in and solid.\n\nI am working with the following programs:  \nPhotoshop CS2  \nAdobe Streamline 4  \nMacromedia Fontographer 4.1\n\nWhat I did to make the font was:  \n1.) Had the person give me a handwriting sample  \n2.) Cut out each letter and made it a TIFF file  \n3.) Batch Converted all the TIFF files to EPS files in Streamline  \n3.) Imported each glyph into Fontographer  \n4.) Created a TrueType Font\n\nIf anyone can give me some hints or tell me how to fix this issue, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nRegards,  \nMichelle\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Matterson,\n\nAh! That did the trick! Thanks so much for pointing that out to me.\n\nI was wondering if there are some good books on creating fonts or some places online that would help me learn?\n\nRight now I am wondering how to get the Large letters (Caps) to look larger than the small letters. I have no idea how to control the size of these when outputting. For some reason when I bring the EPS files into Fontographer it reads the sizes strange and some small letters are bigger than Capitals and things like the \\* symbol are really small compated to the - or \\_. I tried to fix these things by changing the weight but that doesn’t always work. Also is there a way to make a comma ‘sit’ in the right place, and things like that.  \nHere is an example of what things look like now:  \n [irregular font sizes](http://web.archive.org/web/20051001072136/http:/www.mbstia.com/testing/irregsize.jpg)\n\nThanks,  \nMichelle\n\n"

Very readable.\n\nWhile I haven’t come across the size problem (I’ve used Fontlab in my initial font dabbling) I think the answer to the size issue is mentioned in this book — haven’t got it to hand — and involves importing each glyph along with a consistently sized reference bounding rectangle - but I’m sure someone else knows the definitive answer.\n\n"

      "content": "http://www.fontifier.com/  \nI think Dan is referring to this website.  \nThe size issue is to do with the way you import the streamline drawings into Fontographer as Elliot mention the best way to do this is to open all the streamline files in Illustrator (or similar vector graphics software) and create a box the same height (or slightly more) as the combined height of your ascender and descender and position each glyph in it on separate layers, adjusting the width to suit each glyph. Then cut and paste the glyph and the box into Fontographer then delete the box, which leaves the glyphs at the same scale, a rather long job but ultimately satisfactory. You might decide that speed dictates you spend the $9 to get it done by Fontifier, but it is worth doing to learn the basics of Fontographer.  \nTim\n\n"

I know there are many who swear by Fontographer, but I’d recommend that if you can get your hands on FontLab, to do so. Cabarga also has a book called Learn FontLab Fast which is great as well.\n\nI would also go the next step and say that in the future it can be much easier if you take vector art straight into your font application. Since you’re using Photoshop CS, why not use Illustrator CS’s Pathfinder tools? That’ll save you some time on your filled in forms if you like working with other programs before Fontographer or FontLab.\n\n"
