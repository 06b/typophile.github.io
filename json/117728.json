It is a great read but I am having some trouble finding a couple of the faces that he mentions.\n\non page 133 of the book the typefaces 'Kristal' and 'Vogue' are mentioned in a roundup of faces 'paying homage to Futura'  \nMy google skills may be lacking but I thought I would throw it out there.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nBest.\n\n",
