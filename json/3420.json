I find the entire article absurd and even a bit offensive. I especially like how they put selecting a typeface\" in the same category as \"turn on your computer\".   \n   \nI don't think the process described is anywhere near the kind of process logo designers use. What do you think?\n\n",

You could follow the instructions and still come up with the bad logo.   \n   \nPick a typeface. - Aachen is the first one on the list.   \nDo random stuff with it. - \"Loosely spaced type feels panoramic, like the powerful, horizon-spanning vistas of the movies.\"   \nChoose a \"space\" to put it in. - Yep, there it is, a rectangle with round corners.   \nChoose where in the space it goes. - \"Modern, buoyant, light; type at or near the top suggests growth.\"   \nAlign the subhead with something. - Yay, we're done!   \n   \nSometimes, writing for the novice can mean failing to teach the novice anything.\n\n"

But the basic principles it teaches, like the value of contrast, finding points of alignment, etc., are sound.   \n   \n(You need only look at some of the logo work in Typophile's critique forums to find designers who ought to revisit the basics.)   \n   \nThe printed version of B&A is scrupulous about identifying the typefaces used in its examples, lauding their beauty, and generally encouraging sensitivity to type. This is a good thing, in my view.\n\n"

A logo will still 'work' visually in almost every case.

      "content": "Marc,   \n   \nWhat offends me most about this article is that it purports to be all you need to design a good logo. A good beginning article should make clear that it is just that, a place to begin. The article fails to cover considerations about reproduction methods, legibility at small and large sizes and fonts in historic context, or indeed let you know that there are any other considerations. A good beginning article might also include a list of logo design books and encourage further study.   \n   \nMy attempt at humor was based on the vertical type example being labeled \"Radical - makes you work to read it; decorative, rebellious.\" Sorry, but the word I think of when I see vertical Helvetica is dated. (Sombody please let me know when it becomes retro. OK?)   \n   \nAnd, it may be reality, but do we really think it is a good idea for the marketing person to be designing the company newsletter or updating the Web site? He was talking about fonts, but I agree with Yves in this [post](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124006/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27493.html?1078437075) that you get what you pay for. If you want a quality logo, you must be prepared to pay for it. By failing to mention graphic design professionals this article places no value on the years of study and work experience that go into becoming a knowledgeable logo designer.\n\n"
