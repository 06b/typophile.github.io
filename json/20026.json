  "content": "The Western New York Book Arts Collaborative exists to promote, encourage and develop the Printing Arts through education and access for individual artists and underserved communities. Through active programs such as lectures, workshops and exhibitions of all facets of the printed word and image — printmaking, papermaking, illustration, design, writing, binding — the long history of multiple editions from stone carving to the e-books can be explored and made accessible to the public as viewer and participant.\n\nOn the web: [WNYBAC](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010233316/http:/wnybookarts.org/)\n\n",
