One of the faces looks similar to Futura and Century Gothic and the other I'm not sure may be closer to an Optima style.\n\nCan anyone figure these out?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [WBC-1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424023258/http:/typophile.com/files/WBC-1.jpg) | 43.58 KB |\n| [WBC-2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424023258/http:/typophile.com/files/WBC-2.jpg) | 18.15 KB |\n\n",
