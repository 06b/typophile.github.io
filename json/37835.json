Never remove them. Doing so will prevent the system from starting up and will likely require reinstallation of the operating system. They are:  \n• Geneva  \n• Helvetica\\*  \n• Lucida Grande  \n• Monaco_\n\n\\* For optimal performance, leave the version of Helvetica that shipped with the system. However, you can replace it with another version if necessary. In doing so, some application layouts may be affected.\n\n"

      "content": "Here's how I personally set up my Mac....\n\n/System/Library/Fonts/  \nI never touch these, they're core fonts for Mac OS X. Application developers generally expect these fonts to be present and active. The system will still function for some people if they remove some of these, but weird, hard-to-diagnose problems can result.\n\n/System Folder/Fonts/  \nThis will only exist if you have a PowerPC based Mac with a OS 9 System Folder. When OS 9 runs within OS X it is referred to as \"Classic\". The minimal fonts for Classic are Charcoal, Chicago, Geneva and Monaco. I remove everything else. Intel Macs never have this, so people are quickly forgetting about it.\n\n/Library/Fonts/  \nThese fonts are technically optional. Personally, I remove most of them. Here are the fonts I leave behind: Times New Roman, Arial, Georgia, Verdana, Webdings. These fonts are commonly used on the web, and some applications seem to assume they will be present. If a website specifies Impact or Trebuchet, the browser will have to fall back to something else. The same thing will happen in other apps as well.\n\n/Users/\\*your username\\*/Library/Fonts/  \nThis folder is empty by default. I keep it empty, although MS Office will install fonts here.\n\nOn Helvetica: Mac OS X comes with a font called Helvetica, which resides in /System/Library/Fonts. If you need to use Helvetica, in my opinion the best thing to do on Mac OS X is to uses Helvetica LT Std from Linotype. It has an internal PS font name that is different from previous releases, so theres no chance that the system or any application will get the fonts confused.\n\n"

      "content": "With CS 3, Adobe changed their font install procedure--and for the better in my opinion. They now install the design fonts into /Library/Fonts/ so they will be available to all apps. This is better than hiding them in Application Support. Secondly, it appears that the fonts that used to be in /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/Reqrd/, the \"required\" fonts, are now hidden inside the app bundle. So, they put the optional fonts in a standard, expected location and they hid the fonts you shouldn't mess with. This is good from a support/usability perspective.\n\nAFAIK, you can take the fonts out of /Library/Fonts/ and add them to your font manager if you wish. Some font managers will do this for you, but it's always nice to know where they come from and where they're going. They're wonderful fonts though, so some people like to keep some or all of them active at all times.\n\n"

On that basis, you leave it alone and move on. This is what happens when you try to mess with Lucida Grande, for example.\n\nYou can safely deactivate the Helvetica and Times .dfonts in Font Book, and enable alternate Postscript or OT versions, that's what I did. No sweat.\n\nOnce all the system-installed .dfonts that CAN be deactivated have been, you have the \"minimal\" system configuration. For those .dfonts that have been deactivated, there's no reason to trash them--just leave them in the system/library/fonts directory \"just-in-case.\" The few megabytes of storage they take up won't kill anybody in this age of monstrous hard drives.\n\n"
