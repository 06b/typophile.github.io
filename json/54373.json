      "content": "Normally, when I look at book covers from a far (at bookstore racks, for example), I focus on the visual/image/logo first. As I get closer, my eyes definitely scans from top-left to bottom-right.\n\nYou could try putting the book's title below the logo, IMHO.  \nWithout aligning it to the image's curve.\n\nYour logo's outmost outline is bolder than the book title.  \nI found that a bit distracting.  \nTry blurring your eye while looking at your attached image. :)\n\n"
