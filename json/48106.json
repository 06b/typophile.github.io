Every so often, i get to design logos, identities, stationery, etc. from scratch for clients of said print shop, who then get the printing done here.\n\nMy main question would be: who owns the copyright on the artwork i create? Me? The print shop i work for?\n\nOur client orders have never included contracts (i’ve been here for over 8 years), and only once have i signed an agreement giving up legal ownership of the logo i created.\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated!  \nThanks for your time.\n\n [‹ Looking for Software to create a font specimen book?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122032418/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47982 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [I am stunned! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122032418/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47921 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "There is so much confusion between trademark and copyright here. A creator automatically has copyright to his creation unless it is explicitly signed away, which means, as the artist, you can reproduce it to say “look what I did” and nobody can stop you. The customer, implicitly if not explicitly, has paid for the non-exclusive right to copy it as well, and the right to register it as a trademark. When they own it as a trademark, that means they own its association with a certain trade. If you’ve done a logo for Whizzo Cookie Company, you have the right to use it to sell yourself as a designer, but you don’t have the right to use it to sell your own cookies. Arguably, you don’t have the right to make money off the brand in any way they potentially could, like Whizzo Cookies T-shirts. This doesn’t mean you can’t still make money off it, like by putting it in a design book as an instructional example, and selling that book. Putting it on the cover, though, is when you start treading on the blurry line where lawyers just have to fight it out.\n\nCopyright isn’t like a ball that you have to stop holding to hand to someone else; it can be in multiple places at once. If you designed something under employ of a design business, both they and you can use it as a portfolio example, and neither of you can to stop the other from doing so, unless you explicitly gave it up that right in the employment contract. If you didn’t sign anything that actually says what you do is “work-for-hire”, then it isn’t. But reminding your employer that you know this is inadvisable unless you have a good reason to play with that fire.\n\n"
