      "content": "Chesterfield was designed by Alan Meeks for Letraset in 1977. The glyphs in the digital Chesterfield, including \\_T\\_ and \\_F\\_, seem to match the original, as shown in my Letraset product catalog from 1985.  \nChesterfield was also digitizatized by Uwe Borchert as Mops Antiqua (Pug Serif) [http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-56498.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114954/http:/luc.devroye.org/fonts-56498.html \"http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-56498.html\") It does not have the modified \\_T\\_ and \\_F\\_. So I agree with Fivos that the letters in\\_FOUNDATION\\_ are customized.  \nDon\n\n"
