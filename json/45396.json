  "content": "Well, I'm in the market for a new iMac.\n\nI did some cursory searching for a great deal on one of the newest iMacs.  \nI'd like to get this setup:\n\nSpecifications:  \n \\* 3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo  \n \\* 2GB 800MHz DDR2 SDRAM - 2x1GB  \n \\* NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GS w/512MB GDDR3  \n \\* 500GB Serial ATA Drive  \n \\* Apple Mighty Mouse  \n \\* Apple Keyboard (English) + User's Guide  \n \\* Accessory kit  \n \\* SuperDrive 8x (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW)  \n \\* 24-inch glossy widescreen LCD  \n \\* AirPort Extreme  \n \\* Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR\n\nI'd also add iWorks '08\n\nAt Apple.com without my employee discount the total is = **$2,414.68** (includes $136.68 for tax) Free Shipping with the discount it's = **$2269.46** (includes $128.46 for tax) Free Shipping.\n\nAt Macmall.com, the same computer with iWorks '08 AND _Extensis Suitcase Fusion for Mac_ = $2396.96 - $224.08 (in a total of 3 mail-in rebates) = **$2172.88**. The website didn't say it includes tax, but if it does it would be $141.77 more = $2314.65 (if you're curious, Extensis Suitcase Fusion is $99.99 - $90 MIR.) The tax for PA is 6% and usually applies to the total before MIRs and S&H are added.\n\nObviously, Macmall is the better deal (unless, of course taxes are included.)\n\nDoes anyone know of any other discounts or sites that are offering bargains right now on the new iMac? I don't mind paying more if there are MIRs or worthwhile add-ons. A new printer is not a worthwhile add-on however.\n\nI've been out of the MAC game for about 6 years now, it's time I get back in it.\n\n",

Google both \"MacMall support\" and \"MacMall rebates\" and then rethink the 'better deal' ;o)\n\nWays to save a few bucks on Macs:\n\n- Amazon and 'forget' to pay sales tax  \n - Apple.com refurbs  \n - find a .gov employee who can sponsor a .gov discount for you (saves about the amount you'd pay on taxes)  \n - Shop around for your own Ram. You can usually save a few bucks that way.  \n - Buy the low-end model of any product line rather than the high end model. In general, the higher end models don't give you the same ROI for the price. IMHO, you save money and have better equipment if you buy low-end, but upgrade more often. Not to mention that upgrading more often allows you to retain more of your resale value of the current box.\n\n"

Unless the machine will be used for video production, 3D, or playing games under Windows, the basic Apple systems still scream through just about everything. Use the money saved to buy gobs of RAM, tho, because it’s easy to max out 2 gigs with just iTunes, a browser, and a few CS3 apps running.\n\n"

I don't know if you can get your exact specs, but I got my iMac and my laptop there and saved approx $1200 total on the two.\n\nAnd I agree, buy the low end machine. The difference is usually ultimately pretty negligable.\n\nThe refurb machines are either machines that were opened and returned or machines that had problems that were fixed. They come packaged just like new machines and with the same guarantees. The guy I spoke to in the Apple Store agreed that refurb was the way to go.\n\n"

Most of the components aren't easily accessible, let alone upgradeable.\n\nI am however upgrading the RAM myself (I've found a 4 GBs for half the price of Apple's).\n\nAnd you're probably right on the ROI. For the small jump in processing speed is it really worth it to go to the 3.06Ghz from the 2.8? Maybe not. But if you factor in the graphic card (the new one has a 512mb card, the refurb has 256mb), then things start to even out a little more. Again, it goes back to what's upgradeable and what isn't.\n\nAnyway, I know what I want, I just want to see if I can find the best deal on it. And I am in the US, and my employee discount is decent (we're a government contractor, so it's probably on par.)\n\n"

Did you know every mac since 2005 comes equipped with optical audio in/out, just in case you need pure digital audio feeds.\n\n2) Bluetooth is amazing. every mac has it, and so does the Nintendo Wii. It's a little pricey, but dorpping 45$ on a Nintendo Wiimote when I don't even have a Wii was one of the best investments I've made this year. using Darwiin remote (free) or RemoteBuddy (40$) you can use the Wiimote as a remote control for your iMac, and if you have a sensor bar, even as a wireless mouse!\n\n3) Quicksilver. It's like a program-launcher, only way way more powerful, and it's now open-source. Forget dragging a million icons into your dock and then having to hunt to find the program you want, now I open any program on my computer with a thought and 3-5 keystrokes (which is faster than you can read the aplication name when it appears on your screen anyway)\n\nBest of luck with your new love,  \ninnovati!\n\n"
