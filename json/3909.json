Here comes their logo:   \n ![SIXTYSIX](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011114254im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/3105.gif)   \nAs you can see, they want a basic \"MOD\" flavor, and I was wondering   \nwhat typefaces are appropriated for this period. Think Lambretta, Quadrophenia....   \n(PS: SixtySix are nice people, not clients with business preoccupations)\n\n",

I might also suggest a classic - frutiger.   \nMaybe the use of a clean and classic heavy serif font such as the clarendon is a great idea too if you are trying to stay \"period\" style. The logo - an awesome logo it is - is busy - so stay clean and clear with the supportive type.\n\n"
