[Harold Lohner](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142530/http:/members.aol.com/fontner/frontpage.html) has a couple of Ben Shahn -inspired fonts on his site called Bens Folk and Bens Folk condensed. They are not identical to this, but you have to compare letters to be sure. The feeling is still the same, but without all the bounce. (You have to select \"Famous Artists\" from the navigation frame to see them, as I can't get a specific link to the fonts).\n\n"
