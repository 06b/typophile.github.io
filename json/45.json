(Hrant approval is gooood ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif))   \n   \nActually, the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height... So I guess I could make them cap height. Haven't tried.   \nThe old-style is one pixel less than the small caps... Hmmm. (Starting to notice a pattern maybe...)   \n   \nWhat about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change, and if I took all in account, it would end up either like regular old-style or lining numerals.   \n   \nMore questions:   \n   \n1. Being a newbie in (serious) type-design, I was wondering how many characters I should make, I don't really know how they all are supposed to look ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)  \n(I know the alphabet, of course, and the letters used in swedish, å,ä,ö, but I'm having trouble with things like the difference in lenght between en dashes and em dashes and various other characters)   \nSo, Is there any standard on how many (and what) characters there should be in a (professional) typeface.   \n   \n2. Distribution.   \nI was thinking of making my bitmap faces (designed mainly for flash use...) available freely.   \nIs this a good/bad idea?   \nI invest quite alot of time in the tiny bitmapped stuff, but it feels like taking money for the typefaces wouldn't work.   \n  \nPlanned for this typeface for example is an extensive set of characters, small caps, different numeral sets and italics...oh yeah, and bitmap ornaments! ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nCould I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a fee for commercial use? Is there any foundries accepting submissions of pixel fonts? Help me out here, please!\n\n"

      "content": "\\> the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height   \n   \n!   \nThey look so much smaller... Maybe the tall \"Z\" next to the short zero exagerates the difference. OK, just ignore what I said. :-/   \n   \n\\> The old-style is one pixel less than the small caps.   \n   \nThat makes sense, since the old-styles are x-height (this time I actually measured to make sure...), and you want smallcaps to be a bit larger.   \n   \n\\> What about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change   \n   \nI don't remember such suggestions... Anyway, here's the best on-line sample that I know of:   \n   \n [http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143545/http:/www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html)   \n   \nI've become conviced that -overall- the Carter numerals (as I [personally] have now decided to call them) offer the best balance in most situations.   \n   \nIn your case I would make the \"x-height\" of the Carter numerals one pixel smaller than what you currently have for your linings, and extend the traditional old-style choices\\* by two pixels.   \n   \n\\* Except maybe make the \"2\" ascend - possibly by one pixel only.   \n   \n\\> I was wondering how many characters I should make   \n   \nStart with ASCII-8 (for both platforms).   \n   \n\\> I don't really know how they all are supposed to look   \n   \nThat's of course a major thing in type design. And sometimes designers will agree quite closely on things, other times not at all. And some designers worry a lot about the quality of such \"extra\" characters, while others just slap them together.   \n   \nObviously, the more you look at precedents (especially of course reputable ones), the better your results will be - as long as you don't \\*mimic\\* anybody - think things through yourself, and apply your conclusions. For example, the en/em issue raises all kinds of opposing opinions, so in that case it's better to simply look at what those characters are supposed to \\*do\\* in text, instead of copying some precedent. Another example: many people make the Florin upright, but I've heard that the authentic form is slanted; this type of thing obviously deals with cultural preferences, so it's much harder to get right, as it can't really be \"thought through\" as much.   \n   \nThen there's this:   \n [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143545/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm)   \n   \n\\> taking money for the typefaces wouldn't work.   \n   \nFor bitmap fonts it only works if you have a stellar reputation - like Matthew Bardram.   \n   \nOtherwise, consider doing this:   \nMake outlines, and have two versions of the font: one bitmap-only, the other with both outlines and bitmaps. You give away the former, get people \"dependent\" on it, and sell the full version.   \n   \n\\> Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a fee for commercial use?   \n   \nThere are various schemes like that, but I think they're generally not flexible enough, and tend to be more complicated than people like.   \n   \nConsider this instead:   \n [http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143545/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082)   \n   \n\\> Is there any foundries accepting submissions of pixel fonts?   \n   \nSome of them are probably here listening, so wait and see.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
