They are a heck of a lot of fun. They are essentially letter fragments, but you can also use them to draw images. We fonted a few extra sets to sell. You should see the zombie prints the Yee Haw guys have done with them!\n\nOur promo print linked above is by Yee Haw alumnus Brian C. Baker.\n\nDGM  \nThe Arm Letterpress/The Cooper Union/The Dale Guild Type Foundry  \nBrooklyn, NY\n\n"
