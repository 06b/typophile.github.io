      "content": "It's a decent logo that incorporates GG into a symmetrical icon but it strikes me as rather dull and corporate, especially after a quick look at the website where the gloves seem colorful and distinctive and so do many of the models. So the logo doesn't seem to match the image the website projects.\n\n"

      "content": "I understand the reasoning behind it, and I think that, given the right treatment, it will not look too corporate (think Fendi). One gripe, though, is that it reminds me a bit of a buckle, so, again, to me, it says more purse or belt than gloves.  \nAnyway, I think the first thing to do should be refining the wordmark: it looks pretty rough for an high end brand.\n\n"

      "content": "A couple of additional thoughts. Rotating the icon 45 degrees within the background square might make it more interesting. You also might try eliminating the background square, or trying other shapes for the background, or maybe even a color gradient (although you'd still need a black-and-white version for xeroxes, etc).\n\n"
