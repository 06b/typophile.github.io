If you look at the 42-line Guttenberg Bible (1455), the colon is on the baseline (except there was no \"baseline\" with metal type.)\n\nPressing on, the Cicero : <cite>Letters,</cite> printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz, Rome, 1470, have a more-or-less \"centered\" colon. However, the <cite>Letters</cite> printed by de Spira, Venice, 1469, show a \"baseline\" colon. Of course, both of these printers were German, but moved to different cities in what is now Italy.\n\nNoinus : Peripatetica, Jensen, Venice, 1476, seems to use a baseline colon.\n\nFroissart : Chroinques, de Tournes (Lyons, 1559) uses the \"centered\" colon.\n\nBy in Large, the vast majority of printers used a \"baseline\" colon. But if you want to find a few instances of the \"centered\" colon, you can.\n\nSo your client is passing strange, but not completely wrong, unless she is using a type where the type designer decreed a baseline colon. The answer is simple: change typefaces.\n\nFWIW\n\n"

Ha!_\n\nIt is abundantly clear from what they say that some commentators on this topic have either never worked in a media agency or not worked in a position within a creative agency that takes its business seriously.\n\nIf the client represented a multi million dollar account they would have already signed the work contract and agreed in advance to pay in full all amounts charged to their account incurred as a result of demands made by them. It says so in the work contract, and their account manager signed it. If the job itself is worth millions the extra $1000 I'd be charging for a custom colon should easily be within their budget.\n\nIf the client is smallfry they need me more than I need them, so they can walk. It's probably gonna work out cheaper for them.\n\n\"What's that? Now you want $1000 for the custom colon. Didn't you say $500 a few days ago?\"\n\nYes, I did. The price has gone up because you keep dicking us around. Are there any more questions? Didn't think so.\n\nSee ya!\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
