The shapes of the letters are very powerful, and the most ungainly are no accident. When you’ve got them on your brain, their ghosts appear everywhere.\n\nThe rest of the time, I think people seem to get sucked into consiously IDing and analyzing the typeface choices of others around them. I was flipping through some CDs, and thinking, “Why don’t the labels use more hand lettering?”\n\n[Choz Cunningham](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120072757/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120072757/http:/www.exclamachine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120072757/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"
