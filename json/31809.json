Look around for Bodoni’s Manuale Tipographico, the specimen book of 1818. There have been a few fascimile versions of it so you should be able to locate one you can see. There was also a digital version of the Manuale but I don’ tknow if it’s still available.\n\nIf you’re near Chicago, the best collection of Bodoni material outside of Parma is at the Newberry Library including an unpublished MS on Bodoni by R. H. Middleton.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n"
