It needs the funky twist to the letters, like the big drop endings to the cap serifs, so the simple black-poster fonts I’ve been trying (Fenice, Bodoni, Didot etc) won’t cut it I’m afraid.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605213804im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/ultra-fat_3544.jpg)\n\nThanks!

I wish I’d taken a picture of it, because it seemed so very appropriate to the venue... The building it was in, got demolished and they moved across the street; now the sign is done in Zapfino, ALL CAPS! =:-o\n\nCheers,  \nJohn the Fontaholic  \n(who never stepped inside the place, just observed its typography from the outside!)\n\n"
