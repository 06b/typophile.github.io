      "content": "I’m glad someone brought this up because there are some serious HOT FONTS coming from Mexico and other latin countries. Although not a requirement, I would start with fonts designed by actually Latin people. There aren’t a lot of Mexican typographic traditions per se, so naturally these fonts are cutting edge to many of us!\n\n[http://www.pampatype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/www.pampatype.com/ \"http://www.pampatype.com\")  \nSeemingly focused on literary types. Rayuela=beauty!\n\n[http://www.kimeratype.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/www.kimeratype.com/ \"http://www.kimeratype.com/\")  \nI think I love everything coming from the guy! Mexica says it all. Artifex is wonderful too. His custom designed types for El Economista really conveys the “super-ellipse” theme prevalent in Mexican design.\n\nI ditto Bohemia, by Argentian Edurdo Manso. I own it. I love it. And it is certainly elegant like a Bodoni. The Bold is scrumptious as is the rest of the family. I’m in the process of working with it now. Relato and Relato Sans might also be of interest to you too.\n\nFunny Patzcuaro is mentioned. I’m of the opinion that many of Storms’ types have a rustic wrought quality seen in Mexican type.\n\n[http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-31-mramor](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-31-mramor \"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-31-mramor\")\n\nSee Patzcuaro in action: [http://www.lospoblanos.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/www.lospoblanos.com/ \"http://www.lospoblanos.com/\") Super beautiful!\n\nGalliard and Mantina are also very Spanish. Even Sophia could work.\n\nRuben Fontana just released some fonts through FontShop- very chiseled.\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neufville/andralis\\_nd\\_regular\\_fa...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neufville/andralis_nd_regular_fa02_ot/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neufville/andralis\\_nd\\_regular\\_fa02\\_ot/\")\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neufville/andralis\\_nd\\_bold\\_fa04\\_...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neufville/andralis_nd_bold_fa04_ot/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neufville/andralis\\_nd\\_bold\\_fa04\\_ot/\")\n\nBut on the other side of the world there is a very special text system by Portuguese designer, Ricardo Santos- not chiseled but lovely.\n\n[http://www.vanarchiv.com/atlantica.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/www.vanarchiv.com/atlantica.html \"http://www.vanarchiv.com/atlantica.html\")\n\nI suggest you browse Luc Devroye page and check out what’s happening in the Mexican font scene.\n\n[http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/fonts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/fonts.html \"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/fonts.html\")\n\n[http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/mexico.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204124135/http:/cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/mexico.html \"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/mexico.html\")\n\nI hope you find what you are looking for,\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"
