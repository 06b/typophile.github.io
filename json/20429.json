I think people rely too much on FontLab's default options and algorithms that fill-in the settings that were not provided by the font developer. In fact, I think FL should have a 'Release mode' that would warn everything that didn't comply with the standards/specifications, or was considered 'suspect'. That would be the only way to make a close-to-rock-solid font file.\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry, to pick an old topic here, but I want to “get down” and learn all this — for real now.\n\nThese are my impression after reading different articles and asking people:\n\n• Regarding the vertical metrics:  \nKnowledge that has to do with the TypoAscender/Descender/hhea.Ascender/Descender/OS/2.winAscender/Descender etc, is not really any “final bank” of knowledge.\n\nWhy? As an example, I read the \"vertical metrics how-to\" and it seems that a little bit of that and a little bit of this, actually works. And if not set optimal – it doesn’t mean that the font will be corrupt or will not work, am I right? The how-to article is updated a lot of times, changing it’s mind so to speak :)\n\nIs it that these things are more of a very advanced expert discussion going on, similar to which sparkling water has the most optimal bubbles :)\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWill, or will not, an OpenType font work fine (for standard users – not extreme typohpiles) in both Windows and OSX even though these OS/2/hhea/win values do not exactly match? Maybe it’s OK if it differs a little bit from plattform to plattform in the total height when used, since the designer for sure anyway will set his optimal values.\n\nBut will it work? What could actually happen if these settings are not \"optimal\"? Will the font be unstabile? What problems will the user have?\n\nThe reason I ask is that I think it's rather strange that the leading program FontLab’s recommended settings (Calculate Values Automatically) actually \\_creates\\_ a problem like this, and also that it doesn’t seem as if there is a straight answer anywhere to be found.\n\nFinally – take the font Zapfino with it’s long swashes going way above the ascender – if I understand correctly: The Bbox size in this font, is WAY to small for the glyphs. So Zapfino is in other words not an optimal font?\n\nOR… are these values “just numbers” that have to be set correctly — and then we don’t think more about it? :)\n\n(Phew…)\n\nPS. Sorry for a long post, but I’m having problems understanding all this, especially the more I read.\n\n"

      "content": "_But will it work? What could actually happen if these settings are not “optimal”? Will the font be unstabile? What problems will the user have?_\n\nLets say I have a carefully formatted Word document (or an Excel spreadsheet, or a Powerpoint presentation...) that I have created on Windows and which uses default linespacing as determined by the font metrics. I send it to a colleague who will add a couple of graphics in the spaces I have left for him to do so, and then print the document for distribution. He receives the file, opens it in Word on the Mac, and because the font has incompatible OS/2 and hhea table metrics, the linespacing is completely different from my original. All the formatting is messed up. The spaces for the graphics are no longer the correct size. The page breaks are in the wrong places, etc.\n\nNow a smart user will control the formatting in such a way that it will not be screwed up by an incompatibility in font metrics, but as you specified, we're talking about 'standard users'.\n\nThat's the compatibility issue.\n\nThe other issue is clipping. If the OS/2 Win values are too small, any part of a glyph that extends beyond those values will be clipped in many apps and on some printers.\n\n_Finally – take the font Zapfino with it’s long swashes going way above the ascender – if I understand correctly: The Bbox size in this font, is WAY to small for the glyphs. So Zapfino is in other words not an optimal font?_\n\nThe Apple version of Zapfino is an unusual font in a number of ways, but those long extenders actually do fit within the vertical metrics. I can't remember the exact values, and Apple fiddled with the font after delivery (setting a low upm value to increase the relative size of the font).\n\n"

E.g., if your font has <cite>a few</cite> glyphs with very large ascenders, then you may accept that these get squashed or clipped in some applications, to make sure that default line distance will not be too much. In some way, it is you who has to set priorities. (In some applications, clipping behavior even seems to differs depending if the font is PS-OTF or TT-OTF ...)\n\n<cite>not really any “final bank” of knowledge</cite>\n\nThis is true for vertical metrics, but also for font family naming and a couple of other issues. There are too many factors involved, like, will you make PS-OTFs or TT-OTFs, will your family follow Microsoft's example and have exactly four styles, or will it have more styles (or less, which can turn out to be as problematic), or do you want to use your PS-OTFs down to OS9 (even more restrictions)? Unfortunately, this contradicts the compatibility claim made for the OpenType font format.  \nThat OpenType is still 'under development' (see the Vertical Metrics How-to: 'Update to the update' near the bottom) doesn't make things easier too. Be prepared to make updates regularly.  \nNever expect definitive answers, or a \"final bank of knowledge\". They don't exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\n\nKarsten\n\n"
