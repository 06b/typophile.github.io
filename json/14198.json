  "content": "Hello,\n\nMy name is David Bailey, I will be a junior at Drexel University in Philadelphia this fall, majoring in Graphic Design. The reason for this post is regarding a two term co-op experience that I will have this coming fall/winter (approx. Sept. 20th to the middle of March). Drexel has counselors that will help us find co-ops next quarter but I'm starting my own search to hopefully land an interesting/good co-op job for the begining of the close approaching academic year. Drexel's Graphic Design program focuses mainly on the print side of the buisness (logo design, branding, page layout, poster/ad design, book cover design and product packaging).\n\nI'm quite in love with my major and the work I do every day in class and for that reason would love to find an opportunity to spend my co-op at a buisness in NYC, a main hub of design these days. My work has been praised and won awards so I'm confident in my abilities, this is why I'm reaching for the best jobs out there. So far I've been in contact with RCA Records but I won't know if I have an interview for another couple weeks, which is cutting it dangerously close. I've attempted contacting a few smaller firms with no response yet. I'm about to just start calling the bigger names in the city (Poulin&Morris, Pentagram, etc.) to either get a yes or no about interns because I don't want to be stuck without a job. I'm quite aware of this being a Typography board but I'm spreading the word however I can. Please respond here if you have any sort of connections or work in the cit or even have your own buisness there! (or shoot me an email through the forums!) Regarding work I've done up to this point in school and on my own you can visit this link: [http://www.dsinelab.net/dave/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075159/http:/www.dsinelab.net/dave/index.html \"http://www.dsinelab.net/dave/index.html\") Best regards and thank you for taking time to read this. I'm aware this is only my second post here, but all the people I met at TypeCon were so friendly and I'm sure there are a plethora of designers here that might be able to help!\n\nAttached are two photos of my latest work to entice some help!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [whole.kit.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075159/http:/typophile.com/files/whole.kit.jpg) | 177.27 KB |\n| [outside.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075159/http:/typophile.com/files/outside.jpg) | 140.45 KB |\n| [inside.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075159/http:/typophile.com/files/inside.jpg) | 125.09 KB |\n\n",

The approach I think you need to take is, research your potential targets and get an e-mail or something in print that arrives just after the Labor Day weekend.

Those big academic / professional conferences that I've worked at - the American Sociological Association's annual meeting and, one year, MLA - realized, I think, that the goodwill and camaraderie generated by allowing friends / kids / spouses into the meetings and not insisting on some kind of badge at the door was far more valuable than the few bucks lost (I mean really, how many of those people are going to buy a badge anyway?). This happened at MLA, of course, where the registration was close to $700, and at regional Sociological association meetings with about 1000 registrants, where most folks paid about $60 registration, so I don't think price is the thing.\n\nFrom what I understood from talking to those kids at the door, it was more Parsons just being very serious about security, and not a SoTA thing anyway. Besides, that's so not the character of the organization, but I could very much see it as being the character of the school.\n\nAnyway, wayyy off topic.

I get very little satisfaction designing and coding webpages, they just don't excite me like say a magazine or a poster orrrr and ad.

      "content": "David, finding an internship in NYC can be as daunting as finding an empty cab on a rainy day. There are many interns from many local schools that get placed through their schools in the better firms. At Pentagram, for example, we have interns lined up for the next six months and we look for them much in advance and we usually do it through schools – also, interns are by \"team\" not as a whole, meaning that each partner is responsible for hiring their own interns, it is not an office wide initiative.\n\nOther firms may be open to getting interns from independent initiatives like yours but it's usually easier when there is backing from a school program.\n\nIn the end, the best thing you can do is to call as many design firms as you can, get them to see you regardless of them having an opening or not (portfolio critiques can be extremely helpful and you will find that they will serve you better than awards or your work being praised). Try going through Workbook's directory, [http://www.workbook.com/phonebook/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075159/http:/www.workbook.com/phonebook/ \"http://www.workbook.com/phonebook/\") it's a great resource for all firms in Manhattan.\n\nIf you don't want to do web design, don't take an internship where you will be asked to do web stuff. You won't enjoy it and your employer will not get the best from you. If you like print, find a print internship, don't settle for anything you are not passionate about.\n\nAnd remember that it's very competitive.\n\nOh, and yes, you will make lots of copies, mount many presentations and stay late working on making more copies and mounting many more presentations. Don't let that deter you, it's a very formative experience.\n\n"

I'll be heading into the city this week to do that. Wish me luck!\n\nArmin:\n\nIt's funny cause Drexel stresses how awesome their co-op program is, yet their out of Philly contacts are limited or none (only surrounding PA really and it's even worse for designers) I heard nothing but mediocre reactions from my classmates who are using the system, two other girls in my major who are ver skilled are working at Comcast and Aetna but I want to find a more diverse/creative company. I guess I'm being picky but I have a vision and I'm doing my damndest to be where I want to be (NYC) and get what I want (some sort of creative print co-op). Understood about Pentagram, I figured that they would already have a system set up. I have a list of more people I would like to contact the beginning of next week from talking with JLT and by doing my own research/talking with John Langdon.\n\nThanks for the link, I'll check that out...the hardest part is going to be finding a place to stay for 6 months in the city, probably by myself.\n\nThe competative nature doesn't bother me, I'm going to talk to a few professors before I go to my interview next week and have them help me out. I'm very confident in my work like stated in my first post, but not overly confident that I'm not open for suggestion (after all I've only been doing this for barely two years!)\n\nI'm not asking to be lead designer or anything but I'd like to get something constructive out of this co-op, paid or not paid, I can afford to work somewhere that isn't paid if the time is worth it! I'm out to learn because I love what I do and if that isn't good enough reason to strive for the best then I don't know what is! One of the seniors who just graduated got me in contact with RCA. She said her experience was awesome, she got real work to do, the people were nice to work with and she got to meet some bands, which can't be complained about!\n\nAnyways I'll let everyone know how it goes at RCA. I'm still going to be contacting other people as backup even though this job is exactly what I'm looking for! I'll go bananas if I get it! :D\n\n-Dave\n\n"

I would only recommend you call first (hopefully you'll get a nice receptionist willing to divulge the information) to find out who to send an e-mail to. It's better than sending an e-mail to [info@companyx.com](mailto:info@companyx.com) and addressing it \"To whom it may concern\".

I've never really gone on one before, but these are my thoughts:\n\n1. Have questions to ask about what the job/internship will entail.  \n2. Research/know information about the respective company and what they do.  \n3. More questions about the actual company.  \n4. Dress appropriately, I don't own a suit or anything but have heard that interviews for design jobs aren't as formal as some other jobs in how you should dress. I figure some nice dressy pants and a matching collared shirt with some decent shoes, not sneakers!  \n5. Be confident and friendly.  \n6.

I interviewed with the Creative and Video Manager then there are 2 ADs, 2 Freelance Designers and interns. The woman who I interviewed with was really laid back and easy to talk to. She asked how many days I wanted to work and told me what I'd be doing for work, 90% design and 10% administrative but that they wouldn't make me do anything that they wouldn't do. No office bitch work ;) I asked questions about what went on in the office, who handled certain tasks, how many jobs they had going at once and about the record label in general. I was told that they would give me as much work as I could handle so that's exciting. If this fails for some odd reason I'll be pursuing your help more in the next week or so!\n\n-Dave\n\n"
