  "content": "as a creative director, it’s an understood that we have to justify to the client, nearly every design decision— especially why **stringent use of typography is an undebatable must**. but, for whatever reason, they are unwilling to allow a design agency to apply their professional thinking without a fight. the client however, on the flip side, will not allow anyone else to downplay their ’professionalism’ in what they do. it’s a circle in which i have yet to find reason. continue to butt heads until they finally see the light i guess— i’m not really sure what else to say.\n\n",

The one between doing what is right for the design and fighting for it to all ends or doing what the client wants and turning a blind eye to what isn’t appropriate for the design. Some designers are graced with the ability to make the client believe that they’re making all the decisions, but in reality the designer is making all the decisions. Alas, we aren’t all blessed with this soothsayer talent.\n\nI feel your pain.\n\n"

For better or worse, that role is often best played by a person with good ’sales’ personality.\n\n"

I haven’t been in a position to yell at her, but I imagine that she’d do a very good job of smoothing things over and calming me down.\n\n"
