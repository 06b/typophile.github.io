  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m new to Typophile (but a huge fan!) and I’d love to join or subscribe. I’m a bit confused by the current state of affairs…the Membership page mentions an apparently upcoming switch to a subscription system, yet a search yielded a 2005 Membership application form.\n\nWhat’s the status of things? How can I join? If a new system is coming, is there a general sort of ETA for it? I’m keen to get a t-shirt too, but all of the links to depictions seem to be dead, so I can’t tell what they look like.\n\nthanks very much,  \nvv  \nJ.O.\n\n",
