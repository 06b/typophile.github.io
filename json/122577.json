  "content": "We are a professional design agency and currently we have a big font-library of thousands of fonts that we gathered of the last 10+ years including all the (valuable) classics.\n\nCurrently we are facing the problem that we can’t verify if we have the licenses for all of these fonts and if they were obtained legally. We are searching for a smart and “budget-friendly” way to license the fonts that we are not sure about or to “refresh” our whole font-library.\n\nWe need a font-library for at least 15 users , web and desktop, and it is very important that they are suitable for making press files by embedding the fonts in certified-pdf’s.\n\nWe can use Typekit by Adobe because of our CC-licenses but we noticed that is doesn’t have most of the classic 'must-have' fonts like Helvetica, Garamond, etc. and we’re not sure if Typekit is suited for certified-pdf.\n\nBuying individual font-licenses or entire font-libraries like Linotype, Monotype or ITC is very costly. We don’t have any experience with subscriptions for online-libraries like font.com. Are these fonts waterproof for embedding in press files?\n\nIn summery: How can we legally and budget-friendly refresh our font-library and do people have experience with online libraries via a monthly subscription via for example fonts.com? Are these types of online-font-libraries suited for online use and desktop by embedding in certified-pdf’s.\n\nYou could help us a lot with your advice. Thanks! :)\n\n",
