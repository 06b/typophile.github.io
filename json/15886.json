With this type of sample it can always be hand lettered, and its certainly not easy to tell with such a small example, but I \\*think\\* the a’s and the e’s look like they are the same… I could definitley be wrong.\n\nDo you (or anyone) have some good substitutes that might work instead? Thanks!\n\n"
