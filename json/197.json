This is the info at linotype   \n   \n\"Over the years, Helvetica was expanded to include many different weights, but these were not coordinated with each other.In 1983, D. Stempel AG redesigned and digitized the \"Neue Helvetica\" typeface for Linotype and made it a self-contained font family. Today, this family consists of 51 different font weights.\"   \n   \nJust curious why there is a nearly $250.00 price difference between the two packages.............\n\n"
