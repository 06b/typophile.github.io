I have read many pages on the school, instructors, and students but am having difficulty narrowing down what exactly the Basel movement is. Any insight to this would be greatly appreciated. thanks\n\n",

      "content": "That's a tricky one, I guess art movements are a little different to design movements? In the 50's karl Gerstner began to contribute to both art and design in Basel. He still lives there as an artist and from then to the present day has been a prolific creator of 'Concrete' art. This is like constrcuctive art but leaning a little more towards suprematism; the work refers to itself only, does not represent anything in the way abstract work does.\n\nWith research I'm sure you would be able to uncover other artist based in Basel mid-late century who's practice was based around this principal. Interestingly Basel lies at the point where Switzerland, France and Germany meet. This made it a very active area, drawing influence from germany and it's early pioners who were at the front of constructive art.\n\nWith little factual knoledge I guess that during and after the second world war Basel was a slightly more attractive place for those artists and designers not wanting to flee as far away as America. It is more than likely that I'm way off the scent but my reflex reaction is to propose the Basel movement in art did revolve around mathematical, systematic, process based work and took place in the 50's and 60's. I believe Switzerland to be a large inspiration to the Minimalist movement that took place in America in the 60's.\n\nFor me this is quite interesting so people with real knoledge would not only be helping Brice.\n\n"

      "content": "What is/was Basel school? It is a visual, tactile, intellectual and strategic way of developing an understanding and knowhow about creating powerful visual messages. Yes there is/was a Basel style, but people who emphasize that miss the point. The school teaches a complex and unique way of approaching--in my case, graphic design--that will propel students forward into communicators who look at the design business as a way to solve problems in new and different ways. Even more impt than that, solutions that are relevant and appropriate, first, to the organizations for whom they are designing. The words to describe this unusually advanced school are: innovation, change, growth. Personally, my three year experience at the Basel school was intense--both emotionally, intellectually, and visually. Hoffman, Hauert, Weingart, and VonArx opened up an enttirely new world for me.. and propelled me into a deeper, more satisfying visual life that I might not otherwise have had. I don't do much designing any more. I paint full time. But I will tell you, in my painting, I am pulling together all the principles I learned in Basel. My approach is complex--but of course it would be. I learned from some of the most remarkable teachers in the design world at that time. I am grateful beyond words. I would not be where I am today without the intensity and diversity of thsiis forward-pushing, intellectually challenging school with its teachers. I also have my classmates to thank as well. They were and still are awesome in their own right. Bill Schorner, April Greiman, Ken Komai, and Dan Friedman coem immediately to mind. I hope this helps. It is not about the Swiss style. That is not the Basel school. It is much deeper. thanks Jack D.\n\n"
