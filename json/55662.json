      "content": "@piccic The term is a bit of a misnomer, as all the typesetting (what really makes letterpress) is done in the program of choice, using whatever digital typefaces are on hand. Graphics can be added, the whole thing is exported to .eps or .pdf and made into photopolymer plates which are then mounted on a type high base and printed using old presses that would otherwise go unused.\n\nMy thinking was: since I own these typefaces, for example News Gothic in 10pts, in their original castings, which all pre-date microcircuitry, I should have some right to digitize it myself provided I don't try to rebrand or sell it. Otherwise I'm just stuck with 15lbs of News Gothic in 10pts.\n\n"

Next week, they brought us a book page each, and untied the string holding the thing together: 2000-odd small pieces of metal, to be sorted into their little compartments in the cases. Thanks gods for the computer!  \nBut I digress, oops.\n\n"

      "content": "Besides, you could end up with a more interesting digital version than the ones around, like what Metallophile by Mark Simonson does to (digital versions of) Spartan.\n\nI'm not saying that irregularity should be the norm, but often digital versions totally lack the warm appearance and consistency of metal ones, especially at small sizes, but this largely depends on the design itself.\n\nPersonally I am not at all satisifed by all current Gill Sans versions on the market: too little spaced, mostly without any optical size versions, disregarding its original conception.  \nEven the Monotype \"Pro\" version of which I licensed a weight is so tightly spaced you should manually space it to set small point sizes.\n\n"
