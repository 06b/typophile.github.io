      "content": "Hi, I thought it would be good to give you all an update on the Dutch Type situation.  \nThe first edition of the book, 3500 copies, is sold out. There may still be copies floating in space, but all in all it's very hard to find. Doing a reprint would be an option. There seems to be a demand, which is flattering, although whether that demand will cover a minimum run of, say, 3000 copies, remains to be seen. Problem with a subsidized book (I suppose you know that 90 percent of Dutch books on cultural matters is subsidized?) is that they're such good value initially that a 2nd printing becomes more tricky to finance. The dollar-euro situation doesn't make it easier: a reasonably prized book from Europe becomes a luxury item in the US.  \nWhat complicates matters is that I'd feel uncomfortable about just reprinting the book without updating it: the last chapters are pretty much a snapshot in time of the situation 5 years ago, and I think a 2009 or 2010 edition should be an updated one. Besides, the book has a number of (minor:-) errors that need to be corrected anyway. Which means work -- most of it unpaid -- that I'm not really looking forward to. But I'm a Dutch pseudo-calvinist and have a strong sense of duty, so who knows.  \nNow you want to know how many copies are sitting on my shelves. Very few. Less than a dozen. Of course I could speculate with them a bit, wait till the market value goes up, auction them at what then would be a fair price, and earn myself a couple of days on a wellness farm. But I guess the last copies will be given away or sold to friends and colleagues before that day comes.  \nBack to the reprint option: I think I'd need a well-informed, well-organized English-language intern with connections in the publishing world to pull it off any time soon.  \nBTW: yes, I do live in Berlin. My Typophile [bio page](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820031555/http:/typophile.com/node/35512) is more or less up to date. And: no, Google hasn't asked me if they could put my book online, and they're not sending me cheques. Should I send an invoice? That might be a good way to finance a 2nd edition. Any help with this is appreciated (seriously).\n\n"

That might be a good way to finance a 2nd edition. Any help with this is appreciated (seriously).</cite>\n\nFirst of all, I'm not a lawyer nor have I any experience on contracts with the print industry other than what I've read through the years, but still, since you asked, I'll voice my view on the matter.\n\nThe Google Book site says that it has the permission of the publisher to display the whole book on the site; as they are a reputable publisher one could presume that the contract you made with the publisher included a clause that gave them the rights to publish the book electronically. You might want to review the contract and see if this is so.\n\nAs for Google sending you any checks; it seems that they do not pay the publisher any money directly due to the publication of the book in the service; they however fund the service with ads displayed while viewing the book. They pay the publisher a certain amount of money (as to what this amount is, I have no idea) for each click a reader makes while viewing the book.\n\nThis would imply that the publisher receives money directly due to the book, which would imply that you would be justified to receive royalties based on that amount. You might want to go through your royalty cheques/letters from the publisher and see if they specify from which sources the royalty is derived.\n\nIf you have not received any royalty cheques in a while, Google Books says it offers the publisher an easy way of tracking the clicks and amount made from ads according to each book. You most probably have a right to view the accounts that relate to your books, so you might want to politely inquire a copy of these statistics from the publisher in a letter. That said, contracts, according to my understanding, quite often state an amount that royalties have to accumulate to before they are paid. It might simply be that your share of the amount the publisher has received from the ads has not yet amounted to this. You might want to check up on this in the contract.\n\nThis all being said, it seems rather impolite for the publisher to release the whole book to be viewed for free as it pretty much takes away any reasonable chance of a reprint, therefore in a sense depriving you of the monetary income from that source. But if the contract states they have the right to do so, then they have that right. You could always see a lawyer for help with the matter, but I couldn't say whether the cost is worth the possible gains.\n\nJust my two cents, hope it's of some help.\n\n"

Their banner ads are also often one of the primary revenue sources for pirate sites: so you can visit a warez site where fonts are being \"shared\" and click on a paid link for fonts.com. Essentially, fonts.com pays per click to the pirate site via Google. The clever Google placement engine specifically targets pirate font sites to place the targeted click though links for font companies that pay Google.\n\n"

The idea is to allow full text searches, but also to entice the visitor to buy the full text. For \"normal\" books this usually means allowing the visitor to see a couple of pages. Since your book is so graphic-rich, I can easily see why allowing full text browsing of low-res scans was allowed. The discussion here actually supports that decision, as the physical books is still highly sought after despite scans being available.\n\n2. Since Google scanned quite a bit of out-of-print (but still copyrighted) books, there was some litigation that ended in settlment [http://techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/google-book-settlement-site-is-up-payin...](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820031555/http:/techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/google-book-settlement-site-is-up-paying-authors-60-per-scanned-book/ \"http://techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/google-book-settlement-site-is-up-paying-authors-60-per-scanned-book/\")  \nUS copyright holders are entitled to one-time compensation and share of the ad revenues from the pages of your book, IF you claim your right to Google. Not sure what the deal is for European copyrights, I guess you can do further research [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\\_Book\\_Search\\_Settlement\\_Agreement](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820031555/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Book_Search_Settlement_Agreement \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\\_Book\\_Search\\_Settlement\\_Agreement\")\n\n3. There is a program underway that will allow proper book sales through Google books. Because of number of parties involved, it is unclear yet exactly what form it takes, but if it comes with print-on-demand option and hi-res download option, funding the second printing might not be a problem. ;)\n\n"
