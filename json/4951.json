My [Sans Serif Font ID Guide (page5)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050816142743/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage05.html) has the sans families I have collected with these kinds of letterforms, and the closest match was Linotype's Freytag (12-57), but there were numerous differences.   \n   \nYou should know that probably about 90% of logos and trademarks are custom work -- to make imitation more difficult, as well as to have an exclusive 'look'.\n\n",
