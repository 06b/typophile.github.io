      "content": "It seems to have a lot of similarities to Bernase Roman, but there are many differences too. The most obvious differences are the e, g, and y. Image Club used to have a version of this, and it was also shown in the 'Homage to the Alphabet' book from Phil's Photo. It had an alternate 'a' like your sample, and many of the other letters are very similar, including the 's' and 'c'. I will scan the sample and post it in a few minutes.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The only digital version of Trooper Roman I could find was ParaType's [Troover](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114035634/http:/www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Troover.htm). The ParaType version does not use all the same alternates that were used in the posted sample, but the full typeface is also shown in the 'Homage to the Alphabet' book. It would take a bit to restart my computer so I can make the scan and then post it again, but I would do that if anyone want's proof (Yves).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114035634im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BernaseRoman_6418.gif)\n\n"

It also mentions FontBank [Talon](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114035634/http:/www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/talon.htm), which I have and that's why it looked so familiar.\n\nOh the designers were not the same, apparently. 'Bernase Roman' was designed for ITC by Tom Carnase and Ron Bonder; 'Trooper Roman' was done by Dave Trooper, according to Mark's information. I have to say somebody was 'inspired' by somebody -- those have too many similarities.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
