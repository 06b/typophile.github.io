The simple fact is that anagrams are easy to solve when their first and last letters are fixed, and a sentence of such anagrams is no problem for fluent readers.   \n   \nBoumas are a marginal phenomenon that has little bearing on the basic process of reading (immersive or otherwise), which is concerned with the identification of letter sequences, not word shapes.   \n ![boumas](http://web.archive.org/web/20130810134145im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/36284.gif)\n\n"

How much have you studied readabilty?   \n   \n\\> parafoveal vision is used to provide a rough set of options   \n   \nHave you been listening to Larson? Too much, it seems.   \nHis view is certainly convenient: it makes type design much easier (and more artsy).   \n   \nLetterwise reading fails in the light of both empirical and anecdotal evidence.   \nIt cannot explain for example how:   \n1) Empirical: saccades span about three times the coverage of the fovea, with the parafovea unable to convey individual letters.   \n2) Anecdotal: Serifs helps readabililty, and loose letterspacing utterly destroys it.   \n   \nAnd there's something even worse about the letterwise model: it goes against the general heuristic mechanism of the brain, which is a fuzzy, guesswork-based system. Reading is like Chinese cuisine: nothing gets wasted - even the chicken feet are consumed. With the aid of linguistic context, the parafovea provides enough clues to identity _clusters_ of letters (which is all it can convey anyway), speeding up reading - why not use the available information?   \n   \nImmersive reading is a liminal, performance-based task: there is no time for separate letters (most of the time).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
