  "content": "Hi,\n\nAs Thomas Phinney mentioned somewhere else on this forum, a lot of typefaces look very similar (~95% similarity).\n\nI am working on a design in which I take inspiration from a couple of existing fonts. After doing a \"What the font\" search on myfonts.com (with my design), it comes up with the inspirational font listed as nr. 1...\n\nDo I need to start worrying on originality / distinctiveness? Did I take too much inspiration, or is the search engine looking for gross indicators (x-height, as/descenders, sidebearing etc.)?\n\nI know you all take originality very serious, so I wonder what opinions are out there.\n\nSebastian\n\n",

If you are making someone else's design over again, it will be glaringly apparent pretty much instantly, so you probably don't have to contemplate it too long.\n\nBearing that in mind, if you find it is too similar, think about why, more than the specifics of what. If you still want it feel inspired, borrow more from the other font. If you wont it to be more your own look, make up a bunch of silly or weird vatiants, like doodles. Go on to another task for a bit.

Whenever you look too close at a some typeface when working on your own, this may result in something more than just 'inspired-by'.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\n\nPersonally, I am not fond of typefaces that want to look as if they were made by Underware or OurType (the way they deal with curves, stem ends and serifs) or, a few years ago, by sanserifs that wanted to be another Thesis (either being a bombastic family of the same genre, or imitating the special way of handling shoulder-to-stem connections: italic construction in an upright type, at worst without even <cite>understanding</cite> what is so special about the imitated one).  \nIn general, there's nothing worse than drawing 'inspiration' from too recent typefaces -- this is plain 'me too' and waste of time.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems only natural that at a particular period of time, very similar typefaces emerge. So after a period of neat and round typefaces in the eighties, designers felt a need for doing rather dark and rough typefaces. It may even happen that around the same time, two or more designers draw inspiration from similar or same historic typefaces. Sometimes some things are in the air.  \nAnd sometimes it can be a funny game to 'compete' with a collegue. Say, both address a special problem by applying a similar solution, and see who will achieve the better result. But this implies that each must follow his/her own design style (mere copying/imitating outlines and tweaking a bit here and there is not allowed), and most of all, it requires a good portion of friendship and open-minded-ness and humor.\n\nKarsten\n\n"

If you are trying to make a \"me too\" font, you know when you have gotten too close. It may be better to just start drawing type without looking for inspiration from type that is already out there. Something must have prompted you to get into designing type to begin with. I can't imagine it was purposely copying something already done. You probably have a personal vision of what a typeface could be from your perspective. As Goudy once said, \"just draw a line around that vision.\"\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Because it's the letter with the most complex history, which has made it most different from its uppercase counterpart, and, in its present state, because it has practically no part in common with any other letter. John Baskerville and Fred Goudy made the best of this - and Pierre Didot jumped to amusing conclusions about how g really ought to be (see JFPorchez' late-Didot revivals).\n\n"

(Not like they let you do that in museums any more!) I think it's one of the best ways to learn.\n\nWith type, I see nothing wrong with trying to create some version of Times Roman for yourself, with some changes that you think make it better for you. Such work, though, should remain forever in your desk drawer. In any case, it's probably not the kind of thing you want to try to profit from.\n\nIt strikes me as pretty common for a designer to find that something he is making turns out to look a lot like something else. If one designs a typeface and finds out later that it resembles something else, then it comes down to just how similar it is, and the designer's intentions. If the similarity was unintentional, then I think there is a lot of leeway -- and that's where we depend on everyone being ethical and considerate. After all, there are _a lot_ of typefaces out there which are similar to others. A lot of applied design, from automobiles to architecture, has always had the same problem. When one designs something that really works well, one will find that others will model their own work on it. I think designers need to have thicker skins about it -- and I certainly think every designer has to do their part by not being evil.\n\n"
