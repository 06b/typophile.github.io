  "content": "Hey! I'm building an artist directory of sorts for my internship and I'm looking for a plugin for InDesign that can create a link from a delimited text file to the document. I've messed around with Smart Catalog by woodwing, but it doesn't seem to be of much convenience except that it can copy and paste. Because each page is exactly the same in layout (just different text or images plugged in) I'm looking for a plugin that can be used on the master page layout to kind of ID the copy so at the click of a button it will automatically generate the document/fill it in with the proper information.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions, I've already perused this page:  \n [http://www.adobe.com/products/plugins/indesign/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100705144823/http:/www.adobe.com/products/plugins/indesign/ \"http://www.adobe.com/products/plugins/indesign/\")\n\n",
