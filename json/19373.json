I know the two S are not the same, but I’d gamble that if you rotated and stretched the second they would be.

I’ll see if the games he has are all from the same company.\n\nOn the one hand the lettershapes could have been filtered. On the other hand Gaming companies are notoriously cheap and will do all they can not to pay for something like this. So it would make sense ... sort of.\n\nEither way I wasn’t thinking it was some award winning obvious typeface, but some cheap, waste of server space, typeface.\n\nThanks.\n\n"

There is so much crap out there now I figured something like this must exist. My friend showed me the samples and they were from two different companies so it has been decided that they used the same artist to create both titles.\n\nCheers.\n\n"
