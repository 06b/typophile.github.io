Or is it a myth?   \n   \nA colleague claims that Web graphics must be saved at 72 DPI. But in my experience, only pixels matter, unless you want more work for yourself. I've tried it with several browsers on Mac and Windows... but 300x200 pixels is 300x200 pixels at 2 dpi and 2000 dpi.   \n   \nThanks,   \nBen\n\n",

Oddly, my 15\" Windows monitor at 800x600 was about 70-75dpi; at 1024x768 it was about 90-95. I imagine my classroom's projector would yield a larger dpi, since it stretches 800x600 pixels four feet wide.   \n   \nBut in all cases, the same 100 square pixel graphic remained 100 square pixels. Next time someone asks, maybe I'll underscore the pixel dimensions -- but ask for 1 dpi just to see how they react.   \n   \nBut does 72dpi have anything to do with 72 points in an inch, as in 12 points to a pica?\n\n"

Are you saying Brazilians are not people? Or some folk in Finland! I care to disagree with you. What makes you think present software will not work. I am sure software could be optimized. Frankly I have my complaints about the optimization of landscape. I would say software does not support them. Always we can complain. I am good at it. _�_ I had used Aldus Pagemaker in 1989 on a portrait monitor with _great preference_. People in those days wanted portrait. Then again in those days we were not speaking of playing games. Those monitors were great, not the resolution, but the flexibility. You could use them either way, they swung.   \n   \nYou could still shoot Aliens. Think about it Chris.

Even for book design -- in which you might point to the fact that pages are portrait -- it is much more useful to see a spread than to see an individual page. Even for tall, narrow folded pieces like brochures, what you really want to see is how it looks when unfolded, not the individual panels. I simply don't see any compelling reason to prefer portrait to landscape for design work.\n\n"

Better yet, hit the print button. After sitting around gawking you have to get your hands out of your pockets and get in there and actually do something.   \n   \nFor instance I have a spread here I would defy you to work on in landscape.

Who HERE wants one other than yourself? I would much rather, and so would several other people here, see spreads than a single page while doing layout...magnifying glass be damned.   \n   \nIf you can't work on the particular spread you mentioned in landscape, that is obviously your deficiency since no one else seems to have a problem. And since a few companies do still sell portrait monitors I suggest you look into buying one.   \n   \nSoftware can be optimised for portrait display. The new Tablet PCs are primarily portrait since they mimic, well, a tablet. But you can't run all applications in tablet mode, despite the fact that the OS supports it.\n\n"
