Now it’s spoiled and I’ll have to change it.\n\n"

I don’t feel uncomfortable at all, and I find it pretty neat that out of all the character that you could use for an ’obscure cool icon’ you chose my name. It just made me do a double-take when I saw it.\n\nAnd I agree that the charaacter is beautiful (if I can say that about my own name). When I was little, I used to write it as 丹丹, and imagined it as two people holding hands. Yes, I was already kind of nuts at a young age.\n\nCinnabon, mmmm, carbs...\n\n"
