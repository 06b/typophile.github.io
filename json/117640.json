Any ideas on a good font for road labels? It has to be readable at small sizes and to follow curves well.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Arnold came to the subject of cartographic typefaces after analyzing many maps and atlases, and discovering that there was no standard typeface for these types of documents.\n\n"

You need large apertures, big x-height, simplified features, clear contrast between various pieces of information and possibly condensed styles, maybe a set of symbols, and all of it has to be hinted to render clearly across all modern browsers.\n\n"

Text in Google Maps sometimes follows curves.\n\n"
