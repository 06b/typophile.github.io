It would be super nice if you would like to add opinions on favorite cuts of Garamond and why this is your favorite.\n\nAny opinions or information on the subject is welcomed.\n\nWhich digitalized Garamond is the one that is closest to the original drawings, anyone know?\n\nAlso do you use Garamond and for what kind of occasions. If you don't use it, any specific reasons?\n\nAre there other typefaces based on the Garamond that you prefer using today?\n\nMany thanx,  \nJenny\n\n",

I really like Sabon but haven't been able to see the Sabon Next properly (don't have it), from what I read it seems to be more true to the original Garamond cut and his wish for neutrality. More heavy and rounded and a more even tone to it. Any other differences?\n\n"

I still remember Tony Russo using Garamond and if not, then Cheltenham for all the blurbs... and sometimes a title of two. Mike Stromberg was always creating title type with Garamond mixed wtih Mistral.\n\nIt served its purpose - but Garamond was always known for a small x-height -- so it wasn't as easy to read as other serif fonts. However, ITC changed all that when they redrew it and called it ITC Garamond - one of the first things you notice is the higher x-height.\n\n"

      "content": "Beatrice Warde’s piece is called ‘The Garamond types: 16th and 17th century sources considered’, and it appeared for not very convincing reasons under a pseudonym, ‘Paul Beaujon’, in the big hard-back journal _Fleuron_ (no. 5, 1925, pp. 131–79). Not easy to get hold of, but there is a complete reprint of _Fleuron_ (7 volumes) and the piece is also included in a _Fleuron anthology_ (1975) edited by Francis Meynell and Herbert Simon.\n\nThe main point to bear in mind (and to answer the implied question) is that everybody did not believe that the types for which there were three sizes of matrices (no punches) at the Imprimerie nationale in Paris were actually made by Claude Garamond. Arthur Christian, the director of the IN in Paris, did. (His revival, cast from the old matrices in 1900 and fitted out with extra sizes cut by professional punchcutters, used the alternative spelling of Garamond’s name, Garamont.) So did ATF, who made a high-profile type called Garamond. And so, to begin with, did Stanley Morison in England, who got the printer he worked with to import the ATF type and persuaded British Monotype to make a ‘Garamond’ based on the IN type. (US Monotype got Goudy to draw one too, a lively type, underappreciated I think.)\n\nBut according to Warde, Henry Lewis Bullen, librarian and publicist at ATF, where she worked before coming to England, told her he was sceptical. The main critic was Jean Paillard (probably Bullen’s source), who tried unsuccessfully to persuade Christian to be more cautious in his claims. He wrote a brilliant and scholarly essay, bringing together most of what was known about the life and work of Garamond, _Claude Garamont, graveur et fondeur de lettres_. It was published by the small typefoundry Ollière in Paris in 1914 with a specimen of their new Garamont type.\n\nShortly afterwards Paillard joined the army and was killed in Northern France within weeks. Not surprisingly, the specimen did not attract much notice. I know of no copy in Britain. The only one I have found in a US library catalogue is in the New York Public Library. After his death, Paillard’s brother gave a copy of the specimen to the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, adding a note critical of Christian. Quite recently the printing museum in Lyon has bought one, only the second known copy in France. Curiously, it was given to the Lyon printer Audin by Stanley Morison.\n\nSo Morison knew Paillard’s essay, and so did Warde (she mentions it, and perhaps read Morison’s copy). She did a lot of hard work, her essay has good illustrations and it is well worth reading. But it owes far more than she is willing to admit to Paillard, whose essay nobody knew, and it also follows some very misleading trails too.\n\nHer one stroke of genius – and luck – was to spot during her work in the British Museum (now British Library) that the so-called ‘Garamond’ types at the IN were in fact look-alikes, the work of Jean Jannon, a typefounder of Sedan. Having made the discovery, she says she rushed to get the overnight train to Paris where the only copy of Jannon’s specimen of 1621 was in the Mazarin library. (She later published a facsimile.) But how did she know it was there? There is no published catalogue. Does her husband Frederic Warde, who had lived in France, and from whom she was becoming increasingly detached, somehow come into the story? It seems quite likely.\n\nOne thing is certain. Morison had an unerring flair for publicity, and without being too cynical one can be sure that this was what helped the story to run, and run, and run.\n\nPaillard’s French text was republished in 1969 by the filmsetting firm Ofmi-Garamont under a title that is not his, _Qui êtes-vous, Monsieur Garamont?_ (‘Who are you Mr Garamond?’) Good question.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for putting so much passion into answering my questions about Garamond. I've found a very nice old specimen from a printer here in Amsterdam. Although it was called Garamont, instead of Garamond. After reading the above posts I still find the Garamond and Garamont a bit confusing... do you know why for example the director of the IN spelled it with a t? The specimen I found here in Amsterdam was also spelled with a t. Where does the t come from?\n\n"

      "content": "\\> Where does the t come from?\n\nWhen Garamond (or Garamont) did some publishing in 1545 he put his name on the title page of a book in French as Claude Garamont (Beatrice Warde showed an illustration of it), which is the best proof we have of his own preference. But most later writers spelt the surname ‘Garamond’, until scholars like Paillard went back to ‘Garamont’, and in France this is now the preferred form. But since ATF and Monotype used the spelling ‘Garamond’ for their types, English-speaking people (I'm one of them) find it difficult to break the habit. Both spellings are right in their way.\n\nIt's irrelevant to the question, but the italic combination _r_ and _a_ in metal type is a problem: normally you can’t kern the r because it would hit the next letter in combinations like _ri_ and _rl_. Even on some of Garamond’s own title pages the _ra_ combination shows too much space between them, but for the little italic on his French title page with ‘Garamont’ on it he shows an _ra_ ligature – or maybe it's specially kerned. It looks better.\n\n"

I've often wondered if and how that played a role in what he did. The Calvinism of Calvin has, of course, a gallic esprit and a debt to italian humanist learning.\n\nPeter Enneson\n\n"

      "content": "Peter, I would quickly get way out of my depth if I tried to spot protestant features in types. But one might note that Jannon's tiny types, like his _Sedanoise_ were celebrated, and that an earlier protestant punchcutter, Pierre Haultin, had made a little _nonpareil_ that was widely used for printing small-format Bibles. Calvinists liked to buy Bibles, in their own language if possible, so perhaps protestant punchcutters tried hard to make types that would be suitable for printing them.\n\nHaving mentioned Garamont's spelling of his name in 1545 and his handling of the _ra_ combination, I ought to show them both (from Warde's article). The _ra_ looks good in _Francoyse_ too (but the _a_ with macron causes trouble in the line above):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202154618im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Garamont%20-%20Thucydides%201545%20-%20500_5055.jpg)\n\n"
