  "content": "I saw this newspaper while in Berlin a while ago and thought the layout was very appealing and unconventional. It’s distributed on a weekly basis, and the content is mainly politics (from a left wing perspective as far as I could understand). There’s one typeface that is used throughout the newspaper, both in display and text, and at first glance I thought it was [Dolly](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907160715/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=roman). But it’s less fluffy and has more serif in it.\n\nThanks,  \nMalte\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907160715im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/14-2008-titel1_5123.gif)\n\n [‹ Print Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907160715/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43928 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [CHICO'S logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907160715/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43930 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

By the way, the brush script nameplate has been designed by de Groot, too.  \nF\n\n"

This typeface has been distracting my mind for quite some time now.. From what I understood of your comments in the quiz-thread, this font can’t be licensed? Too bad.\n\n– _Malte_\n\n"
