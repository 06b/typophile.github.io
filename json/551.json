  "content": "Hello you all,   \n   \nThis is my second posting here and it has to do with the extent to which I see typefaces of the Thesis family (by Luc(as) de Groot - lucasfonts.com) used worldwide today. A customized version of \"The Sans\" is the worldwide corporate typeface for Compaq. I have recently seen The Mix used on the website some four design companies... I have also seen typefaces of the family included in the standards manuals of some big universities and colleges in USA. Well, it seems to me Thesis is becoming more and more trendy, following Rotis and Meta...   \n   \nSo, as a result, I was wondering what apropriate similar typeface could I suggest to one of my clients, who wants to use a dual typographic scheme The Sans/The Mix ( by similar, I mean: modern yet not lacking the \"established\" feel, highly legible on several applications, and still retaining a strong personality of its own...).   \n   \nThe client is a BackStreme, a software company, producing proprietary software algorithms for data routing and data compression.   \n   \nThank you all,   \nGeorge\n\n",

Unfortunaytely, I only have Base12 so this was the only one I could actually try out on package and on the brochure...still I don't feel it as belonging there.Out of all, Fago is the most promising, I like it, just that I don't have it.(to me it looks a lot like Officina, I guess I could try it instead?).   \n   \nP.S. I was perusing my fonts collection and there are two problems raising here:   \nATM displays an error message to some of them: \"font files are invalid or corrupt\" is there anything left to do to fix that?   \nand second: I have 38.000 typefaces so far and only a small percentage of all have eastern european characters. Could I myself add these characters to a T1 font and output it is as a TTF for a client, as long as the client gets a licence for the T1 font? - ITC Binary is not available with EE encoding...\n\n"
