I did a new font based on this recently called [Changeling](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010232913/http:/www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/changeling.html), but it wouldn't really match your sample. I don't know of an official digitization of China, but there are some unofficial versions such as Castcrafters' [Camp Caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010232913/http:/www.castcraft-software.com/cgi-bin/castcraft/dc2.02?135%2C256).\n\n"
