This allowed you to have a line above the first line of copy etc.\n\nDoes anyone know how to do this in Indesign, the only way I can figure is to use underline but this seems a little strange because how would you get the line above a first line of copy???\n\nCan anyone help?\n\nCheers  \nSteve\n\n",
