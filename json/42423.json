      "content": "PLAYSOCCER looks like Helvetica 77, maybe 87, but I can’t really tell because of the low resolution, and if this is the resolution of the logo, I doubt anyone will be able to tell if you change the font slightly. Also, I couldn’t find this logo in use online in the Google searches, so maybe nobody even knows it exists.\n\nI don’t think it really makes sense to do much to the other logo as it’s the official logo. If nobody can figure out the font, you could play with a higher-resolution version of that official logo, like the one [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026093853/http:/www.aysostore.com/)\n\n"
