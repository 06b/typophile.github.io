The showing is incomplete, so I can't see enough letters to confirm it.   \n   \nI cannot find a showing of it online, mainly because Tamil is also a language, with it's own fonts.   \n   \nHowever, closer investigation shows Tamil to be a more square typeface than this. It has very similar serifs though.\n\n"
