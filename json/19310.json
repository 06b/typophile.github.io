I had been using Font Reserve in OS 9 which I basically loved but they don’t seem to be making it anymore for the mac. I think Fontbook (which comes with the system) basically sucks. It has a nasty habit of activating all my fonts without my asking it to, my “collections” get mysteriously deleted, and it won’t activate/deactivate fonts when I open individual jobs. It also has very limited preview options. I’ve heard that Suitcase is good now - I ditched it years ago.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n(forgive me if this topic has come up before - I didn’t do a thorough search before posting this)\n\n [‹ Word into Art at The British Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808125210/http:/typophile.com/node/20656 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [wich typeface is this one? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808125210/http:/typophile.com/node/20634 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

However, this is partly because Mac OS X is the most feature-rich operating system ever in terms of typographic functionality. It supports more font formats than any other platform. Windows doesn’t have any way of isolating font activation per user. Windows also doesn’t have any system-wide API that would make auto-activation possible, and I don’t think Vista is going to be adding it. While these features were present in OS 9 to some extent, the way they were implemented meant that there was a much greater danger of system instability. Also System 9, for practical purposes, never provided much language support.\n\nThis comment, of course, is from the perspective someone using a Latin-based language with an interest in graphic design. John Hudson would be quick to point out that Windows wins in terms of support for complex scripts such as Arabic.\n\n"

You can delete those directly off the computer but I keep them there, they are mostly all at the bottom of the font list in programs anyhow.\n\nI don’t know how you set your fonts up but I create folders for the Foundries and place the respective fonts inside, and you can create sets inside there as well or on their own. That way I never deal with having all fonts in the same massive folder. I use FEX at home, and used to work out of my house. I recently moved to a studio and use it here as well, I love it. The only time it’s gone funky on me was when I tried to preview a corrupt font. Other than that activation and management has been instantaneous between programs.\n\nAlso, on my HD I created a font folder where I keep my fonts and organize my own fonts and have the preference set so FEX does not copy or move anything for me.\n\n"

This way you protect your main library.\n\nBut you’ve gotta admit it’s a little ridiculous. Every time you install something it places fonts wherever and then you have to track them down.

You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, alter, or attempt to discover the source code of the Font Software. If you want to make modifications to the Font Software, you must obtain the prior written consent of FSI.”\n\nSo, if I want to run FontDoctor on a FF font, I need to get a letter! (And of course, there’s no assurance I \\_will\\_ get one.)\n\nI’m really not sure what these no-mod rules are for. I’ve been told that allowing mods increases tech support difficulties, but I wonder, is Adobe flooded with tech calls for font mods? Was Linotype, when their MyFonts EULA allowed mods? It seems that most people who actually read and abide by EULAs would be able to understand a clause indicating that modifications would not be eligible for support.\n\nThese clauses offend a foundry’s most fastidious customers, customers who actually care about type, while leaving the uninterested unaffected! What a strange business approach: we only want customers who aren’t interested in our product. I certainly won’t buy font from outfits with that attitude.\n\nBy way of contrast, look at Village’s EULA:  \n“You may modify the fonts for your own purposes, but the copyright remains with Village, and the number of computers covered by the license remains the same. You may not commission a third party to modify the fonts without first gaining permission from Village. You may not sell or give away modified versions of the fonts.”\n\nThat seems to cover it in a fair way.\n\n"

Some of these things occurred because of the way fonts worked under Mac OS 9 and before. For example, under Mac OS 9, the Finder would actually open fonts in a read/write mode and change font IDs if necessary. The Finder could modify fonts! (This cannot occur in OS X)Also, modification of font suitcases was an accepted practice under OS 9 and before. There is a lot of junk out there.\n\nIn these cases, the ’modification’ by Font Doctor isn’t related to outline shapes, hinting, kerning or other design aspects of the typeface. Typically the fixes are simply repairs to the structure of the font suitcase. In my experience, if table data is bad, FontDoctor lists it as irreperable.\n\nIn some cases font vendors may not be as forthcoming with replacements as Linotype seems to be. Many older vendors have disappeared. Font vendors depend upon selling fonts, and also re-selling the same fonts later. I don’t think it is reasonable to expect Linotype to help peoeple use fonts they already have.\n\n"
