This seems to happen especially when it's  \nthe first time a contest is judged - remember what happened at  \nBukvaraz, when a number of ATypI board members (including  \nthe VP) got a bunch of awards. In the case of first-time awards I  \nhave this suspicion that it's partly due to a fear of not having  \nenough entries, and asking people you personally know to submit.  \nThe categories with \"no winner\" might attest to that, although  \notherwise refusing to grant a first place because you think no  \nentry deserves it is certainly admirable in my book. Morisawa  \nused to do that too.\n\nPersonally, being a pragmatic, I would give the benefit  \nof the doubt that a judge stepped out when it came to  \nhis own entry (I even remember this being a clause in  \none other recent event) and I will reserve judgement  \nuntil I see the fonts in question, to see if there was a  \nstrong chance of undue bias. To me type design is too  \nmuch like \"family\" to be too absolute about preventing  \nsome people from entering at all.\n\nThat said, I certainly am glad I didn't get second place  \nto an entry from a judge! In such a case I would doubt  \nmy OWN objectivity in arriving at a proper reaction...\n\nhhp\n\n"

You hint that \"someone, not me\" suggests that Bukva:raz was improperly run because \"a number of ATypI board members (including the VP) got a bunch of awards\".\n\nWhat you are hinting at is that the judges would compromise their standing by favouring the designs of people they know, over those they could not guess the authorship of. But should not all submissions be judged equally on a level field? Or should we have exercised some form of reverse favouritism, penalising typefaces the provenance of which we recognised? Have another look at the names of the judges, and consider if you would repeat these suggestion to their face.\n\nUsing one competition where you may, probably reasonably, make some pointed remark as a stepping stone to smear another is really lax logic.

I remember at least two people  \non the T-D list, although at least one of them  \nI can dismiss as motivated by vindictiveness.\n\nBut even if nobody complains (in public) I think  \nthere really is a potential problem there - and  \nthat's why the TDC decided to change (see below).\n\n\\> What you are hinting at is that the judges would compromise their  \n\\> standing by favouring the designs of people they know, over those  \n\\> they could not guess the authorship of.\n\nActually, no - in the case of Bukvaraz I was saying that there  \nwere submissions by people who shouldn't have submitted; and  \nyou could say that was the real problem, putting the judges in a  \nposition very difficult to balance. On the other hand, I have a  \nsuspicion that -at least some of them- were encouraged to submit  \nby the organizers, who perhaps panicked in the face of an initially  \nlow submission count (and perhaps entries of low quality). And once  \na submission is made the organizers couldn't ask the person to withdraw  \nit (once the competition did get enough entries), and the person  \nsubmitting would have to be quite exceptionally gracious to withdraw  \nit without being asked, so... What you have is a very human mess.  \nAnd one of my points was that this seems to happen more often with  \nfirst-time competitions.\n\nSo I don't blame the judges of Bukvaraz (or the TDC) for  \nanything (except maybe being human) - especially since  \nsubmissions were anonymous. Mostly I'm trying to explain  \na phenomenon.\n\n\\> But should not all submissions be judged equally on a level field?\n\nYes, but is that 100% possible? All I'm saying is that we  \nshould take the answer to that into account when deciding  \nwhat to think of certain results.\n\n\\> Have another look at the names of the judges, and consider  \n\\> if you would repeat these suggestion to their face.\n\nIf that causes me to be less candid (and it would) then that  \nis my own weakness. Maybe the facelessness of online discussion  \nallows for greater candor? And maybe we should embrace that as  \na means to improve ourselves?\n\n\\> the TDC now prohibits all board members of  \n\\> entering work in the type design competition.\n\nA wise if painful decision.  \nNot everybody is a pragmatist. :-)\n\nI have noticed the TDC paying more attention  \nsince squeaky public wheels started grinding,  \nand that makes the TDC a better organization.\n\n\\> had to be created in 2005.\n\nThe form I filled out said \"any typeface  \ndesigned, first sold or first used between  \nJune 2004 and October 2005\", so I'm good.\n\nBut when Rialto won at the TDC, and I complained that it was outside  \nthe eligibility timeframe, I didn't even get a reply. The good news is  \nthat it's such a great font (by two really good people) that it behooves  \na pragmatist to let it go. Unless of course somebody challenges  \nthat pragmatist's own validity, then it's just a form of self-defense.\n\nBut thanks for providing the opportunity for me to clarify - I'm sure  \nthat certain people were grumbling in the background, and that sort  \nof grumbing can only get louder.\n\n\\> I seem to remember Hrant offering his winning entries for a few years now.\n\nDon't you remember when a certain competition chairman  \nhad to apologize in public for revealing that a certain  \nentry had NOT won? Please don't let your annoyance that I  \nwon something and/or haven't given up complaining in public  \nabout flaws in -otherwise commendable- competitions trigger  \nsuch desperate maneuvers.\n\nEgos get bruised all the time (like when I don't win  \nat a competition, which happens often) but hopefully  \nwe can tame our reactions.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Knowing most of the bukva:raz! judges very well, I find it highly improbable that they were motivated by any desire other than to make the best selection of types from the entries before them. Actually, it is a laughable suggestion. But the question of whether ATypI board members and officers should have been elligible to enter in the first place is a legitimate one. If ATypI were organising a competition now, I would certainly be making to case to the board that we should be excluded from entering. Not because I wouldn't trust the judges to be impartial, but simply because it avoids the kind of insinuation -- unproveable and hence also impossible to defend against -- that Hrant has voiced. The TDC policy that James describes makes a lot of sense to me, and had I been involved in planning bukva:raz! I would have recommended the same.\n\nI've no idea how the judging was conducted for the Creative Review competition, but it can't help but look sleazy when the judges appear to have declared themselves the winners in two categories. That's just stupid, especially since it is the first time this competition has run, and it should be trying to establish credibility. One thing I will note about the Creative Review competition though, is that Fiona Ross was identified as a judge in the call for entries and earlier publicity surrounding the contest, and had been asked to judge non-Latin entries. In the event, this was considered unnecessary as there were not a significant number of non-Latin types entered, so Fiona was not involved in the judging. If the reputation of the competition is tarnished because of the judging, Fiona's certainly should not be.\n\nLike Jean-François, I have judged a couple of competitions, and found it necessary sometimes to abstain from discussion or voting on specific entries because I felt there was a conflict of interest. This seems to me fairer than withdrawing the entry from competition: better to let the other judges make a decision about it.\n\n"

Your own criticism of  \nthe \"implementation\" shall we say of Bukvaraz, and your own  \nsupport of the change at the TDC is part of this.\n\nThat said, the way a given person \"concludes\" what \"probably  \nhappened\" depends more on that person than anything else! :-/  \nThe trick I think is to give people fewer excuses to sling mud.  \nNot that your own mention of Fiona is anything else, John, and  \nin multiple directions no less...

As is made perfectly clear in the current issue of the magazine, no judge was allowed to vote on or to lobby for their own work. A member of Creative Review staff was in the judging room at all times. The reasons for each decision are recorded in the judges’ comments in the issue but, simply put, if a typeface won a category it did so because it was the best entry in that category, pure and simple. To suggest otherwise is a wholly unwarranted slur on the professional reputation of our judges. Regarding the judging panel, Domenic had a diary clash and so couldn’t attend while Nick was delayed in his return from Los Angeles and so also didn’t make it. Fiona kindly agreed to join us and offer her expertise for the non-Latin categories. However, because the entry for those categories was low, we agreed with her some days beforehand that the expertise of the other judges would be adequate to assess those entries.\n\n"

Yet trying to be objective about a person's work when you are going to see that person in 15 minutes and collaborate with him or her for the rest of the day it strikes me is likely to be distinctively more difficult than judging a person's work who is not another judge, and not in the room with you all day.\n\n"

      "content": "OK, as the chairman of the judges I think I should comment, too:\n\nThe type world is small and many people know one another, if not in person then at least via email. We certainly know of each others work. It is therefore near impossible not to be tainted when judging a type competition.\n\nHowever, suggesting that the panel of judges may have behaved with impropriety is insulting to my professionality and integrity. Winning a category with one of our typefaces, or Jason Smith with one of his is because the work stood up against the other entries, not because we were rubbing each others back. It is also grossly insulting to Dave Wakefield, who proved to be an invaluable umpire and neither Jason or I would have dared suggesting that our type should win simply because we were the judges.\n\nIt was unfortunate that both Domenic Lippa and Nick Hayes were not able to participate. Such is life, we have businesses to run. In the end this turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we were able to spend more time on in depth discussion on individual entries. None of our desicions came easy, precisely because we know how much time and effort goes into creating a good typeface. In many cases we compared the quality of drawing of individual characters, compared the quality of spacing, how the font family works etc to finally favour one design over the other.\n\nIt is debatable whether judges should be excluded from entering work. I certainly have come accross my own work when judging D&AD entries and it has not impaired my facilities to be objective. I have been designing type for long enough to recognise that there are others who are better than me, and when comparing my work with theirs I will say so.\n\nIn the end you will have to take my word for it that the judging process was indeed conducted properly. If you think otherwise, I'll see you at dawn...\n\nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag Ltd\n\n"

Any material which helps the jury make its assessment  \nshould be included with the entry.\" on the entry form is one  \nof the big reasons I decided to spend the money and submit.\n\nI think any merit my work has tends to be below the surface  \n(although some people still won't like what they'd see there!)  \nand when people are given 5 seconds to form an opinion they  \nusually think \"this is a mess\" or \"it's unnecessarily complex\".  \nI submitted my essay from Spatium (and now Hyphen) as well  \nas Emily's actual book (it helped that she's in London :-) and if  \nthis were a competition that had taken a fraction of a minute per  \nsubmission to form an initial opinion (and thereby axe most of the  \nentries) I wouldn't have stood a chance. Unfortunately, most com-  \npetitions, including the most prominent one, are exactly like that.\n\nI think the best thing a competition can do is Go Slow.  \nTo me Critique magazine really did it exceptionally well...  \nand I'm not saying that just because I won there too! :-)\n\n--\n\n\\> Why are type design competitions held after all?\n\nI think the core reason is: people like to watch.\n\nhhp\n\n"
