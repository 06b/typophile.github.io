Would it violate anyone's copyrights to post it here as an MPG or MOV file?\n\nBill\n\nOn Friday, August 11th from 11:15 a.m. - 12:15 p.m., York will discuss font management in OS X by participating in a panel session titled \"Demystifying Font Management in OS X.\" The session will be moderated by well-known book designer and typographer Kent Lew; other panelists in this session will include Peter Lofting of Apple Computer, Bruno Steinert of Linotype and Stephen Coles of FontShop/Typographica.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi guys:\n\nOh and while your at it, can someone please ask Apple if they are going to improve their OpenType implementation so that you can use all your \"layout features\" in any application. Not just Adobe and Quark products.  \nIt seems these days that Microsoft is paying a whole lot more attention to typography that Apple. I think Apple needs to be aware that more and more designers are purchasing only OpenType-CFF collections these days and we ACTUALLY use smaller supporting applications. I just think the Apple AAT framework need to be more robust.\n\nMikey\n\n"
