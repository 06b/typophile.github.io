  "content": "I have expanded the [Project Diacritics](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014115411/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Diacritics%20Project) website. Now you can easily attach pictures to particular languages and diacritical marks. We welcome your submissions of fine examples of correct accents. Let's help other designers to create accents for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and other scripts.\n\nDiacritics project is a free on-line database of knowledge and  \nexperience - how to design correct diacritics (what size, shape and position  \nan accent should have). Text concerning the history, use, languages, and  \nalso some technical information is related to each diacritical mark. The  \nproject is on-line at [http://diacritics.typo.cz](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014115411/http:/diacritics.typo.cz/ \"http://diacritics.typo.cz\").\n\nEveryone is invited to check it. If you would like to edit  \nthe text, simply Register and Login - every page can be edited, corrected or  \nenhanced with pictures by anyone (Wikipedia model).\n\nFilip Blažek  \ninfo(at)typo(dot)cz\n\n",
