Later I made do with antique machines for documents that were best not passed to the secretaries -- who had the Selectrics. But I did become familiar with the typefaces on the elements for the Selectrics. I thought then, and I still do, that they were mostly well designed, within the limits of monospace. But I too was happy when my office moved to the Mac and laser printers in the early 1980s.  \nDon\n\n"
