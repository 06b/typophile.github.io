  "content": "Hi All,\n\nThis is probably going to be the most generic question ever, but I’m looking for a typeface for a rebrand of a store I’m going to be working on. The current identity is very similar to ITC’s Edwardian Script (ugh!), and the company doesn’t want to move too far away from it. I’ve always been a bit cautious towards scripts, I rarely use them because I’ve always felt that they’re usually far too fiddly for identity work, have a tendency to fill in and aren’t particularly easy to read, as well as being old-fashioned for my purposes. Can anyone suggest contemporary, script faces that are elegant but are thicker than Edwardian Script? I’m also open to suggestions of italicised serif display faces that look modern.\n\nI know it’s all a bit woolly and I’ve not narrowed things down, but I’m hoping I might discover some fantastic new faces and/or foundries that can get me going in the right direction.\n\nCheers\n\nSi\n\n [‹ Salon Branding](http://web.archive.org/web/20071121083404/http:/typophile.com/node/20183 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Italics style question - help pls. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071121083404/http:/typophile.com/node/20061 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’m a fan of Affair Script, Brisa, Suave Script, I’ll have to develop my ideas more and make my choices.

To me, what he had to say made a lot of sense, applicable to any enterprise.\n\nJust curious.\n\n"

The store is old, with very fragmented, inconsistent branding (that seems to have been amended by different signwriters on the few different branches of the store). As for what it sells, the store is quite upmarket and sells a very diverse range of homewares. The store has heritage but needs to be brought up-to-date considerably.\n\nI’m going to be presenting multiple approaches, so I’m keeping my options open. Really I was using the thread to discover new foundries/faces - If I don’t use them for one option, I can always bring them into play elsewhere. I tend to work on identities frequently, so I like to keep on top of what’s out there.\n\nSi\n\n"
