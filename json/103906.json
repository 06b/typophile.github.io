      "content": "This fancy letter would have been drawn by a monk illuminating a medieval manuscript. The sample image is small but the F seems to include Celtic knots, a common theme in the initial letters used in famous manuscripts such as the Irish [\\_Book of Kells\\_](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016215749/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells).  \nToo fancy for a font, but a vector version of this F may be available. A Google search for [vector Celtic illuminated manuscripts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016215749/https:/www.google.ca/search?q=vector+celtic+illuminated+manuscripts&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=rhK_UZKxJMLVqAGcn4C4CQ&ved=0CCoQsAQ&biw=1074&bih=906) will lead you to similar letters, and with some perseverance you might find a vector of the initial F used on the book cover.  \nA good assortment of old fancy initial capitals, but not including this particular F, can be found at [Aridi initial capitals](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016215749/http:/www.aridi.com/index.php/component/content/article?id=41).  \nDon\n\n"
