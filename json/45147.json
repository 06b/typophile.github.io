I have a huge load of documents to include in it, but some things are still missing, so I might, once in a while, in the next few weeks post a request, asking for some of you to kindly provide me with what’s missing, if you happen to have these docs. As for now, I am desperately in need of a decent picture of Evert Bloemsma.\n\nAny help appreciated, and aknowledged in the book of course.\n\nThanks,  \ndr\n\n [‹ Degree classification...does it REALLY matter?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080515232008/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44938 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Pill Gothic OTF Small Caps won't work in InDesign CS3 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080515232008/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45129 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
