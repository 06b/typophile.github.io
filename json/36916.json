  "content": "I was thinking about the huge amount of work that goes unused after clients refuse to pay, the spec work is not approved, ideas  \nchange, closing deadlines kills more difficult developments, great personal works and explorations student work, etc... in other words lots of great work that is simply parked. Is there any places where people share these files, sell them, trade them, continue collaboration, etc....There is type foundries that sell completed fonts (but not individual characters or wordmarks, there are stock agencies that sell photos and illustrations, but again what about the forementioned type of work.  \nIf not, is there enough designers out there that would be interested in contributing their ideas towards building such a community.  \nNot sure what form it would take but perhaps something like a an e-bay where clients or fellow designers can bid of works in progress, buy fully completed projects or ?. If there was enough work and a good searching tool this could be a good project.\n\nInput please...\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Ken. I agree and disagree. I can not do the work you are talking about for $250 and neither can you. This number is what I could see someone paying for premade logos with the understanding they get what they pay for. Good quality vector work, a clever design, the chance the work needs the be altered (which would cost extra), no research specific to their unique situation, the basics that may or may not be exactly what they would want if money was not a concern. Sure I realize that I could be billing my rate of $85/hr. and starting from scratch and do a great job, but if the funds are not here, that scenario is irrelevant. What I am exploring here is to find out what the consensus is regarding helping poor or for that matter cheap clients. I could offer the experimental/un-used/ or if you like \"failed\" work that is going nowhere at a great discount and helping someone get something they consider in their budget. I would possibly be building a venue that would eventually cause loss of the clients that would pay 10x or 20 or 40x the price for a custom job. I think there will always be people that will pay the going rate and get excellent custom work which will usuallly be better. This is not something to be fearful of unless you can not produce to custom work.\n\n"

I don't think we're talking here about recycling an old, failed, idea whole hog (at least I'm not) but sometimes I have an idea, it doesn't end up working for one particular job, but I can use the same idea or elements of it in another job. I don't think it's cheating, it's all my work. Some jobs take more time and work than others, and the client shouldn't care as long as it suits their needs and is within their budget.\n\n"

No matter how successful your last piece for them has been, you will always be undercutting your costs to do their work. There is no future, as a businessperson, in working for cheap clients.\n\nI understand that you may want to establish a foothold in your marketplace. And undercutting costs is a time-honoured way of doing that. But pick your clients. And make sure they understand why (and for how long) you are offering them cut-rate prices. Dig that trench too deep and you will be stuck in it.\n\nPoor clients are different. Poor clients understand your value, and would pay you a proper wage if only their money wasn't going to some other, more desperate, need. Working for poor clients is honourable. But don't short-change them. Give them good, honest work. And choose not to charge them for the hours you put in.\n\nFor either client, I still don't see where resurrecting something from a previous design project solves your current client's communication problems. In such a case you are merely decorating the page.\n\n"

If something works for a job, it works, no matter how old or new.\n\nI also think, Ken, we must work in different areas of design. I'm not overly concerned with researching my clients communication needs, I do book design, which is, after all, decorating the page. And sometimes old ideas can look new.\n\n"

There are dozens of t-shirt sites these days. Upload a few illustrations to those.\n\n- portfolio. show it as part of the process in any given project. Or, just show it as extra personal work.\n\n- sell it. Upload it to a stock art site like iStockPhoto.com\n\n- Submit it to one of the print design annuals. (I have a hunch a good chunk of the stuff submitted was never used by actual clients ;o)\n\nAs for the discussion of showing unpicked work, note that clients don't always choose the best work. That's not because you didn't provide better solutions, but rather because they weren't sold on the better solutions...which is more telling of yours or your firm's sales techniques moreso than design skills.\n\nThe design profession is 10% and 90% sales IMHO. ;o)\n\n-Darrel\n\n"

If it is legitimate, you'll know.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOne idea for a letter morgue: I am enamored with the openfontlibrary.org, which seems to be getting past some recent growing pains. It is a place where one could possibly set free a handful of promising letter forms that never made it to full typeface status, especially if the type designer is completely certain they won't be completing it.

As Magnus says, they are my own ideas. I don't see it as laziness. I designed a prototype for an American cookbook that never happened.
