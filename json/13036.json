It is common for designers to make some round characters, such as the uppercase S and C slightly smaller than the uppercase O.\n\n'I'm very unsystematic about things like the relative sizes of round characters, I judge them purely by eye. It's my impression that S and C often need to be a bit smaller than the fully-enclosed O because the openings in their forms make them look bigger. This applies equally to the lowercase.'\n\nComments on visual character heights by Matthew Carter, Carter and Cone Type, Inc.\n\n"

      "content": "I wonder if your trouble doesn't come from trying to digitize your drawings? My experience is that drawing the letter with pencil is much easier than discovering the right number and location of bezier points to construct the same shape. If this is part of the problem, try putting the points at different places, more or fewer points. See how few you really need, and when previewing, which points give the best shape. I've done my drawing with points on the left and right extremes, with none along the middle, reflexive curve, which seems to be the trouble area. Hrant's idea is good; if there's a PostScript font with an S you like, open it in your font editor to see how the other designer did it.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitstream used to test type design candidates by giving them paper and pencil and telling them to draw an S, freehand, without correcting anything. The resulting shape brought a thumbs up or thumbs down....\n\n"

      "content": "This is what I do to make an S look good, which is a bit different from the question of making an S. I usually have the shape in my head okay, but the difficulty is managing the curves with a set of bezier curves in such a way that the whole thing hangs together and you don't get odd bulges. I should also note that I generally like my S to flow, so avoid putting straight segments in the middle of the bend unless it is a particularly wide S, e.g. for an extended face, or a real grotesk.\n\nI've found the key for getting the S to look good is to ignore the middle bend completely while positioning most of the nodes: just let it ride free. The really important thing is the positioning of the nodes on the extremes of the vertical curve sections. You have to think of the relationship between these as what really gives the S its form. So you have to ignore the floppy bend in the middle and just concentrate on visualising the relative positions of those four nodes. [[S1.gif]](http://web.archive.org/web/20140606143245/http:/www.tiro.com/John/S1.gif) Getting the two terminals in place helps at this stage, because they define the curves that will lead into the vertical sections, and so into the bend.\n\nOnly when the terminals and the nodes on the vertical sections are looking good do I start paying attention to the bend. I either grab the middle of the bend curves themselves or the control handles off the vertical nodes, and drag them until I have the weight I want _at the middle of the bend_ and an appropriate relationship between the two edges. [[S2.gif]](http://web.archive.org/web/20140606143245/http:/www.tiro.com/John/S2.gif)\n\nNow I draw guidelines (or sometimes just use the knife tool) between the opposing control handles off the verticals. Where these cross the outline defining the bend, I insert a node that I will use to control the middle of the bend. [[S3.gif]](http://web.archive.org/web/20140606143245/http:/www.tiro.com/John/S3.gif)\n\nWhat I have now is a set of bezier curves that produce a very smooth form. I can now adjust the control handle on these to refine the shape. I try to avoid moving the nodes themselves; if a node on one of the vertical needs to be moved, it was probably in the wrong place to begin with, so I might delete those nodes I added on the bend and go back a step to ensure that my shape remains smooth. I may shift the position of the mid-bend nodes up or down a little, if I decide the weight in the middle is too light or too heavy. Usually, to get the final form I want, I only need to move the control handles, being careful to constrain to the tangent. In the final graphic [[S4.gif]](http://web.archive.org/web/20140606143245/http:/www.tiro.com/John/S4.gif), I have put the unrefined S3 form in the background as a mask layer.\n\nI no longer think of S as the most difficult letter. I now have a much harder time with the leg of the R.\n\n"

Mike Parker and Matthew Carter brought this to Bitstream from Linotype, where it was the standard entry test for prospective drawing office staff. The really nasty version involves a model S in a rectangle, and you have to re-draw it by hand in another rectangle of different dimensions, adjusting the shape of the design to the new proportions.\n\n[My favourite story regarding the Linotype drawing office is that of Tim Holloway, who was hired by Walter Tracy for a management role at Linotype. Tracy insisted that all the management have a working knowledge of the different aspects of the business and making of type, so required Tim to spend a couple of weeks in the drawing office, just to learn what went on there. Tim, it turned out, was a natural, much better suited to drawing type than to management. As I've said here before, I think Tim is one of the greatest living type designers, overlooked by most commentators simply because almost all his work has been in non-Latins.]\n\n"

Indeed, one could argue that nationalism is the identification of cultural identity with the idea of the nation state, i.e. that cultural identity = national identity (or would do, if only one had control of the territory!). Historically -- at least within the remarkably brief period of time in which nation states have been the normative form of territorial and social organisation --, the identification of cultural identity with national identity has been a powerful force in the struggle against colonialism and, obviously, in the forging of new countries. But I don't think mere historical efficacy should lead us to uncritically accept the assumption of this identification. We can validly ask whether cultural identity can persist and flourish other than through identification with the nation state. We can also ask whether, in a cost/benefit analysis, the whole idea of the nation state might have done more damage to cultural identities -- especially to that of cultural minorities living within or across the boundaries of nation states -- than it has fostered them. As just one example, the Welsh cultural identity has fared very much better within the framework of the supra-national European Union than it ever did within the merely national framework of the United Kingdom.\n\n"

They are the successors to the \"great\" Italian city-states which arose during the late Middle Ages, and gave the world corporations, stock exchanges, letters of credit and all manner of financial legerdemain that troubles mankind to this day. Nation-states gained ascendancy as the influence of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church declined in the wake of the Renaissance and the Reformation. They proclaim to be secular institutions, but each nation-state also proclaims, in one way or another, that it–and it alone–has been ordained by God (whichever flavor of Whom you choose) to continue His work on earth. All nation-states write their own history, in which they are always the good guys, and each nation-state is, in its own mind and mythology, better than any other nation-state on the earth. So the killing goes on...\n\nTribal or ethnic groups are the same cosmos writ small. The names which the various tribes of Native Americans gave themselves are almost always translated as \"the human beings\" or \"the people,\" and the practice doesn't seem to differ much anywhere else in the world. But whether nation-state or tribal group, one underlying concept remains: the world is divided into Us and Them, and **We are the Good Guys**. We are the human beings; everyone is, well, slightly less than human. This notion even attained the status of the unerring word of God's chosen representative on earth, when in 1452 Pope Nicholas V of the aforementioned UHC&A Church proclaimed in his encyclical _Dum Diversas_ that enslaving infidels and pagans was entirely in accordance with God's will and wishes. Thus, Open Season on People of Color was officially proclaimed, and remained the Western World's official policy for more than four hundred years and, unfortunately, appears to be unofficial policy even today.\n\nWhy does the madness continue? The German philosopher Ernst Cassirer, in his _Philosophy of History_, explained it very simply and very clearly:\n\n\"The past has no why, it _is_ the why of things.\"\n\nThe past is how we got to **now**. But if **now** is somehow less than satisfactory (which seems to be the general consensus), then we aren't going to see a significantly different future until we put the past behind us. The brilliant blaze of sunlight is made up of _all_ colors, and the improbable phenomenon that is mankind (and womankind) is made of _all_ its diverse peoples. No one religion owns the truth; no one tribal or ethnic group embodies all that is good in man; no one nation-state can lead us on an unerring path into the future. It doesn't just take a village; it takes a world...\n\nHmmm, the subject of this forum is presumably the design of the letter S, which I have always considered to be the sexiest letter of the alphabet, but I didn't realize that it could so thought-provoking as well.\n\n"

In case anyone is interested, here's how I typically approach the S problem in CorelDraw:\n\nWith monoline faces, I begin by drawing two elongated ellipses, one beneath the other, the bottom larger than the top. Then I fudge both ellipses until there's some overlap. I then draw a straight line to define a path that is tangent to points on both ellipses. I convert the ellipses to curves, break the contours at the points of intersection, remove extraneous bits of the ellipses, and combine all objects into a single object. I then convert the tangent points to smooth connections and turn the line segments into curves. Then, selecting the newly-smooth connections and using the curve-smoothing slider (by far the most flexible of any that I have encountered in _any_ drawing program), I increase the smoothness of the curve until the connections disappear. In almost all cases–probably nine times of ten–the connecting curve between the top and bottom elliptical elements assumes a pleasing shape all by itself. With the hardest part out of the way, I can then tweak the remaining segments of the ellipses to balance the overall design. Granted, the process of developing outlines for a face with stroke contrast is a little more involved, but the process works pretty much the same.\n\n"
