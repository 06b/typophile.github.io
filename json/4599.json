  "content": "Background   \nThe high level problem I am trying to calculate the width of a line of text for a given font. I am generating a dynamic PDF using fpdf.org's tool. FPDF utilizes PHP files among other things to generate the PDF. I can use this PDF to generate the length of a line of text given the definition. I've provided two sample definitions below, one for Arial and one for Amazon (a script font).   \n   \nQuestion   \nMy problem is I want to make sure I'm understanding what all of these variables are first. I don't understand what the following variables are:   \nflags   \nut   \nup   \nstemV   \nAs you can see from the images below, Arial isn't really caluclating correctly, but Amazon is. The reason I don't think Arial is calculating correctly is because the ration between the EM Square =2692 and the EM Width (width of an U.C. \"M\") =833 be SO far apart. Am I misinterpretting the numbers and/or variables?   \n   \nFOR DETAILS AND IMAGES SEE:   \n [http://www.varigata.com/type/fontsample.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018215917/http:/www.varigata.com/type/fontsample.html)\n\n",
