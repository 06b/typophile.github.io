In which case my chances of getting one of those stickers as a memento -even anonymously- are slim... Speaking of anonymity, why is the AtypI story so?\n\nBTW, the mock shirt could have been done by another party, as a reaction. \"Shram\" is indeed strange; the classic \"Rant\" would have been better. Being called Paparazzi though is quite common - it's the first thing some people (especially those not sufficiently exposed to foreign names) think of; my sister used to be called that all the time by a male coworker - but in that case it was a term of endearment.

Knowing that Hrant is capable looking at it and still being unflappable makes me smile. Hrant has proven that he's capable of being as outspoken as he is and also capable of rolling with the jokes that come with that outspoken territory.\n\nThe Hrant/Jakob Nielsen comparison is right on -- though I've never met Nielsen. Jakob Nielsen is in the same boat. Some love him, others love to hate him and he can be the butt of some jokes. But Nielsen has been there, like the bit of irritating sand that makes a pearl possible. Nielsen's set himself up as an expert in that he has strong opinions on everything and he backs it up. You look at Nielsen's work and it can be pretty ugly and gets designers and other UI professionals in a tizzy (me included at times), but you cannot question the fact that his presence on the scene has elevated the discussion and kept the debate on the table in good and productive ways.\n\n"
