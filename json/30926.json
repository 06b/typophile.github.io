      "content": "In general, the quality of your text justification will be directly proportional to the length of your measure. With a short measure, any typesetting application, Adobe Illustrator included, will be forced to add large amounts of word or letter spacing to justify your text. Assuming that this is not the issue at hand, here are a few of things you could try:\n\n<dl>\n<dt>Advance Justification Options</dt>\n<dd>Thankfully, even Illustrator offers some advanced options for text justification. You could try adjusting the minimum, maximum and desired settings for word, letter and glyph spacing.</dd>\n<dt>Hyphenation</dt>\n<dd> When enabled, hyphenation should improve the quality of text justification. Illustrator offers advanced options here as well.</dd>\n<dt>Single-line vs. Every-line Composer</dt>\n<dd>When the Single-line Composer is enabled, Illustrator will adjust word spacing on a per line basis. Contrastingly, the Every-line Composer will reflow all lines of text in an attempt to normalize word spacing and therefore improve justification.</dd>\n</dl>\n\nAll of these advance settings can be found in the additional options dialog of Illustrator's _Type»Paragraph_ window.\n\n"

I'd argue that thanks to the paragraph composer, both Illustrator and InDesign have better justification than QuarkXPress. (You may choose to think that as an Adobe employee, of course I'd think that. But it's my honest opinion.)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

I'm sorry, but when one is laying out a 40 page brochure -- and page 6 is being moved to page 13, and 21 is half left on 21 and the other half moved to page 30 and followed by page 30 is now 31 and toss 31... one who is aware of production and production time stays within a page layout program.\n\nif you are designing - or doing 1 say, poster, book cover, etc. yes, by all means have fun in Illustrator...\n\nOtherwise, as I wrote before use Quark or Indesign.\n\nAnd I honestly couldn't care less if you were an Adobe employee - glad you have employment. When something works - why fix it. I'm an original Beta and Gamma tester of Quark - and it is like second nature to me. I'm at the stage, I'm an old dog - and sorry I don't want to learn new tricks - I just want the job done right the first time.\n\n"

It hate the way you sometimes get all the word space nicked out of a line when you have APC switched on. Seems better in the long run, maybe because I prefer to trust my eyes.\n\nBy the way, with reference in the movie you linked to, the right hand par wasn't really the best example to use, as the last three lines get progressively shorter. Maybe the word ‘in’ on the second line could have come up (if the measure would allow).\n\nIf not, wouldn't one (if one were a person responsible for setting copy for training videos) just re-write the dummy copy to fit nicely?\n\nAlso, the overhanging double quote shown next seems a nat's too far overhung, don't you think?\n\nChris\n\n"
