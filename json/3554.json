I posted the second image as it had some of the types of corrections, such as spine of S, length of decenders, The 5 and 6 sizes, etc. It was an enquiry to see if this the style of the corrections, as well as the proportions that Randy Jones was suggesting and not some form of attack.   \n   \nWith the 'helpful assistance' you are imparting, it is obvious I will not learn anything. Would you prefer it if I didn't post stuff here, or ask questions ? Would you like me to carry on muddling along, teaching myself ?\n\n"

I think he does want to hear what we think of the font. On the other hand, again: I hope Graham is open to making a fixed one if he comes to feel that there's enough wrong with it as it stands - otherwise it's just Art. But font development/release is a matter of thresholds, not absolutes: there is always a point beyond which it's really not worth fixing a font.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It will still only end up my interpretation of the font, and still carrying errors, but it will end up the best I could do at this time.   \n   \nI am not the best speaker/writer, so any assumptions I may be insulting, or rude, will be incorrect. Mr Rigby, While you probably felt what you said was right, I feel the remark about living designers and critique to be wrong. We do gain insight, well I do. I also believe others posting their work here also gain insight from remarks made about the work. Otherwise why bother posting ?\n\n"

There are still a few lines that need cleaning up. The change to the S seems to give it a slight odd shape.   \n   \nShould I lower the Middle bar in the G a bit ? It seems a bit high.
