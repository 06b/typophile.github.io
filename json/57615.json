  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm new here, you've got a great thing going on! Congrats.  \nI would like to find some fonts that are similar to the following ones. I realized these are not fonts but hand-drawn lettering, but I guessed maybe you could give me a hand.\n\nThese come from a 1950's argentinian melodrama. The most difficult one is the one in which is \"Luis CÃ©sar\" is written.\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DVD\\_PROJECT-6(1).jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100822154825/http:/typophile.com/files/DVD_PROJECT-6(1).jpg) | 32.02 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I searched all the script fonts that might have been like this which I have collected for my Guide and really found nothing that had its blend of casual and formal letters. The most similar (to me) was Jason Walcott's [Shirley Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20100822154825/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000048#flont), and then Mark Simonson's [Lakeside](http://web.archive.org/web/20100822154825/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000346#specimen), which is a bit more monotone in its stroke. Neither is very close, but at least they have the feel of this era, and they use somewhat similar letterforms. I was governed most by the L and C initials, and so the D for \"Direccion\" is not too similar. That D style doesn't seem to go with most scripts that have a similar L & C.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I hope you'll enjoy it just as much as I do!\n\nFYI: All movie posters and titles in Argentina during this period and before the early 1960's, they were all hand-lettered. My former father-in-law, Alfredo Faistman was one of the busiest hand-lettering artist working in downtown Buenos Aires ad agency during the late 40's and early 60's. Alfredo worked mainly in movie titles and posters -- I considered him a genius w/ the brush and pen. I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of his works. I can contact his living wife and ask her if that's the case, she might remember.\n\nAlfredo was my inspiration during my early graphic design career, and for the love I have for typography. I met him in NY in the early 60's while dating his daughter. He used to work for Norcross then, a very famous greeting card company based in NY (similar to the Hallmark company). Alfredo was hand-lettering greeting cards until the early 1970s. That's when the greeting card industry starting to switch to photo-lettering.\n\nWhen I get more information about your movie title... I'll pass that information to you.\n\nsal\n\n"
