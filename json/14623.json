You could insert a regular space on either side of the underscore, then adjust the horizontal scale of those spaces to match your requirements. Once you are satisfied with the results, you could copy and paste the space+underscore combos (beginning and ending) wherever you wanted.\n\n"

      "content": "Ok guys. Now i figured out that I can just insert a space or an em space. That works fine. only thing is that i have a lot of text and it isnt really the most efficient way to manually insert spaces, especially if i need to change the width of my textbox. So i really need to use character / paragraph styles, but i just cant figure out how to include a space into a character style. Any help????\n\nThanks a lot,  \nCo\n\n"

If you want the break to be bigger, you can replace the thin space w/ a regular space, then muck with the word-spacing parameters.\n\nObviously, you want to do this after all editing is done. :0)\n\nJay\n\n"

      "content": "elastik, I don't know if that works with your text flow, or if it's even more complicated than the suggestions made before, but you might as well try using table cells and take the bottom cell border as your (under-)line (with the stroke weight of your choice applied). One cell with a variable width sits in the middle (for your text) and two cells with fixed widths to its right and left. All the other cell borders (above and vertical) are then set to \"none\"/no stroke.\n\n"
