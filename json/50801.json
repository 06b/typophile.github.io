Correcting colour and press prep is obviously accepted, but even amateurs have a right not to have their shots monkeyed with._\n\nWhat crap. This kind of thing depends on the publication’s editorial policy and what the photographers / image owners may have agreed or not agreed to regarding having their images published. No photographer has any kind “right” not to have their shots monkeyed with. Where did you get that idea? Cropping, color correction and so forth go on all day every day in my job. We even do it to costly rights-managed stock photos by way of written contractual agreement we have with the stock agencies we buy from—because we have to be practical\n\nPhotographers and image owners may indeed not appreciate the applying of actions and effects to their photos—but that’s just too bad. It’s what happens. There isn’t much they can do about it, and at the end of the day most of them wize up and accept it as normal and par for the course.

Learn to love the fuzziness. Maybe you need to lwt your design be a little rough around the edges - I dunno, maybe let a bit of dirt creep in... In general, one reason media hire designers to create illusions. The best photographers you can afford take the best photos the can and then they colour correct and crop their hearts out, then designers colour correct and crop their hearts out, and used all their skill and experience to pick just the right type and arrange it all nicely on a page and it’s all a very nice, very slick and manufactured illusion. So, here you are with this project... except the illusion you have to create is that the photos are better than they are.\n\nSounds like fun :o)\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

By amateur I assume you mean that these shots are low resolution/poor lens choice/bad exposure/poor focus/bad composition/&c.; try this. First, see if you can improve the image by applying a ’fix lens distortion’ filter. Then skew the image if additional perspective correction is necessary; this possibly after rotating the image if it’s crooked. There are a number of effects you can produce at this point, such as [Photoshop specific] change to bitmap mode and generate lithograph patterns; multiply a duplicate layer and mask based on the most flattering color channel; change color mode to grayscale and then to monotone/duotone might get you something interesting to look at. Or do something collage-like. I like the suggestions here that move you in a typographic direction, because let’s not forget we are type folks here.  \nI prefer large to small and inconspicuous.\n\n"

I believe there _is_ an inherent “right” to expect your work to be treated respectfully. For instance, I would never think of hiring an illustrator to create a piece for a publication and then dump it into Photoshop and change the colors of the work to suit my own needs. If these sorts of changes need to be made, I would — in _every_ case — consult the artist at the least, and either give them the opportunity to make the changes themselves or sign off on any changes I made to the work. If that agreement couldn’t be secured, I would pay the artist the ’kill’ fee and move to someone else. Of course this is a different situation when dealing with stock images (where the artist signs away all creative rights), but when dealing one-on-one with another creative, I believe there are creative rights involved.\n\n_There isn’t much they can do about it, and at the end of the day most of them wize up and accept it as normal and par for the course. People who can’t accept their images being manipulated or cropped in some way are unrealistic and unprofessional._\n\nAgain, I disagree. There is nothing unprofessional about expecting the designer to preserve the artistic integrity of commissioned work. If I treated the illustrators, photographers and other creative professionals I work with with that attitude, I would find my stable of professionals empty pretty quickly. And I wouldn’t blame them a bit for refusing to work within that atmosphere.\n\nHaving said that, crops and scalings fall pretty much in the realm of ’design considerations,’ and should, in most cases, be professionally acceptable to most commissioned artists.  \nThis gets a little away from your topic of working with unprofessional snapshot work, but I had to voice my difference to the concept of whatever-the-designer-wants approach.\n\n"
