  "content": "Hey guys\n\nI need your opinion. I am currently in the process of completing a booklet. It contains mainly photos and illustrations, with some text explaining the photos and legends for my illustrations.\n\nMost pages contain a headline, which I’ve set in “Bliss Pro Extra Bold”, size: 23pt, leading: 18pt.\n\nThe text is set in “Vista Sans Book”, size: 10pt, leading: 12pt.\n\nAll settings in InDesign.\n\nI’m no professional in type, but you are ;-) - what do you think? I’ve experimented with “Agenda” for my headlines but found it to be too strict and too strong a contrast to my illustrations which mostly consist of natural shapes... I’ve also tried “The Sans” for the text (I guess it’s a faux pas to set small text in TheSans anyway) and although I like the typeface itself, I found it kinda hard to read.\n\nI want the text to look modern and contemporary but not soulless.\n\nWhat do you think - it’s not another Gill/Frutiger booklet ;-)\n\ncheers,  \njan\n\n [‹ Surf mag logo design](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423012508/http:/typophile.com/node/39249 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [News Plantin or Aldine 721? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423012508/http:/typophile.com/node/39281 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
