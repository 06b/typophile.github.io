  "content": "Greetings type enthusiasts. On a recent trip to Europe I was browsing the newsstands and came across these two lovely typefaces. I thought they were great. I'd like to buy them/download them if possible for my own uses and I was hoping someone out there could help me identify them. Much thanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012030147/http:/typophile.com/files/1_32.jpg) | 41.11 KB |\n| [2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012030147/http:/typophile.com/files/2_31.jpg) | 39.16 KB |\n\n",

You might browse Dieter Steffmann’s [collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012030147/http:/moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm) for a start. For the headlines within the paper, FAZ employed a special version of Fette Gotisch called »FAZ Fraktur« made by [URW](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012030147/http:/www.urwpp.de/deutsch/home.html), which unfortunately is not used anymore since about two years.\n\n"
