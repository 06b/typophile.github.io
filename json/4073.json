The photographs have been digitally stripped of all traces of textual information. The text pieces show the removed text in the approximate location and font as it was found in the photograph._\n\n",

      "content": "Thank you, thank you, that's one of the most enlightening displays I've seen. Typography is only part of the problem. It's the total accumulation of mindless and trendy material. In an essay in the Japanese design magazine, Idea for September 1973, I wrote that these bring visual discomfort to our everyday lives and one endures them like the noise and foul air. If I may quote myself: \"One has only to try and fill a shopping list in a supermarket or attempt to get from one part of a major city to another to experience the chaos that is contemporary packaging, promotional material, and signing.\" For what it's worth. I think the situation has gotten even worse in this digital age.\n\n"
