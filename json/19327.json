For example, is the tracking on book variants generally less/more?\n\nThanks for your drips of knowledge.\n\n",

      "content": "To me a book version should be optimized for a optical size of 9pt. So it will work in a range from 7 - 10pt. It should be wider and a bit bolder than the common 12pt Design. But some designers and foundrys use the term book in a very lax way and made minor changes compared to the 12pt design.\n\n— [astype.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20070105024235/http:/www.astype.de/)—\n\n"

      "content": "Most text types are issued without optical sizes, such that a good deal of the type’s structure is determined by the requirement that it work well enough at 9 pt and 96 pt. A book version - not really a weight so much as an optical size - should work better at the normal sizes for immersive reading - 10 to 14 pt, say.\n\n"

More and more you will find DISPLAY, SUBHEAD, TEXT, and CAPTION in PRO versions of fonts. In such typefaces as [Adobe Garamond Premier Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20070105024235/http:/store.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/garamond/garamond.html) and other typefaces, not OT, but their designer’s are aware of the needs of today’s users.\n\n"
