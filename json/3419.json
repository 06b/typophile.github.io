  "content": "ello ello all -   \n   \nI would be very grateful if anyone could point me in the direction of work undertaken by The Foundry, London. I'm aware of all the work shown on their website (if you don't know of them: [http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142802/http:/www.foundrytypes.co.uk/)), and of the work they did in extrapolating wim crouwel's lettering into complete sets, but I'm sure I'm missing out on a whole lot of goodness.\n\n",

I'd kill to get my grubby little paws on any of his custom typefaces for the likes of the Post Office etc.   \n   \nAll the best,   \nColin\n\n"
