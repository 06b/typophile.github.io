  "content": "Hello all.\n\nI’m desperately looking for any high quality examples (actually, any examples at all) of Romane, a font developed at Scriptorium de Toulouse in 1994 by one Séverine Hameau.\n\nSo far I’ve seen it mentioned in passing a half dozen times and there are a couple of pictures – one on [Typofonderie](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181558/http:/www.typofonderie.com/gazette/articles/scriptoriumdetoulouse), and one on a French [cultural directory](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181558/http:/www.culturesfrance.com/adpf-publi/folio/lettres/08.html).\n\nDespite the fact that it was never committed to metal or digital type due to an accident, I can’t help but believe there must be more prints of it about – it won honorary mention for text font in Linotype’s 1st International Design Contest, it can’t have completely disappeared.\n\nSo all in all I’m after any information at all, and would ideally like some URIs to high-res images. I’m completely besotted.\n\nRegards,  \nBarney\n\n [‹ ID CS3 / Word Doc import snafu](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181558/http:/typophile.com/node/37833 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Alphabelt by chance ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181558/http:/typophile.com/node/37840 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
