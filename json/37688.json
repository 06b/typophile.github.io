  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a problem that in my Mac's fontbook, in some Font families, single font files all appear as \"Regular\" instead of Bold, Italic... etc  \nand that makes Illustrator and InDesign only reads one single font from the family and cancels the others since they all are called Regular.\n\nIs there possibly any fix for this? Is there a mean for me to rename them?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
