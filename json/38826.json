  "content": "On the current topic of handling of fonts on the Web (via “@font-face” or .eot files), I have made a blog post and launched two related surveys (one of Web designers, one of font vendors).\n\nThe survey for font vendors is here:  \n [http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=I9LYBFmggGJ8SCTU0u3CtQ\\_3d\\_3d](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063426/http:/www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=I9LYBFmggGJ8SCTU0u3CtQ_3d_3d \"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=I9LYBFmggGJ8SCTU0u3CtQ\\_3d\\_3d\")\n\nThe survey for Web designers/producers is here:  \n [http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wyFVRRqnxAmTypkzThJOkA\\_3d\\_3d](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063426/http:/www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wyFVRRqnxAmTypkzThJOkA_3d_3d \"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wyFVRRqnxAmTypkzThJOkA\\_3d\\_3d\")\n\nMy blog post is here:  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/11/web\\_fonts\\_1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208063426/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/11/web_fonts_1.html \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/11/web\\_fonts\\_1.html\")\n\nComments welcome, and I hope all the font licensors represented here take the survey, as well as the Web designers.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n [‹ Student expressive typography project.
