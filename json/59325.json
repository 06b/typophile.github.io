If only had I Googled it first, I would have found out just how many other people had the same idea. Shoot, I even had a logo.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025220im_/http:/typophile.com/files/reddoor_6611.jpg)\n\nEdit: Is there a way to use curly quotes in the subject?\n\n",

They are both uppercase, use the same typeface and color and are too similar in size.\n\nAlso, I've been there several times when a good idea turns out to be taken, but I've always googled first. It's the silly things, like when famous foreigners have first or second names that sound like something I've thought up in a different language, that annoy me the most.\n\n"

Maybe my eye is off, but I happen to think that having too much contrast within the type itself will detract from the simplicity and stability, and make it look unprofessional, not the other way around. I guess the point is moot though, since I won't be using it anyway.\n\nI tried a few different text treatments to the bottom line to create some more contrast and interest, but nothing really worked out. I didn't want to spend too much time on it. Maybe I need to abandon the Charlemagne font for something with more weights/styles.\n\n"

I agree that too much contrast is distracting, but there's that middle ground between too much and not enough that I feel hasn't quite been reached. So sorry you won't be able to use this; I don't advocate violence, but you should find the other people and threaten physical harm if they don't relinquish control of the name ;)\n\n"

I know it's tricky here to create contrast between \"Red Door\" and \"Design\" cause it's really one big title \"Red Door Design\", but what bothers me the most now is that there is different stroke widths in the two sizes, one way to fix that is to use all caps on one line and \"real\" small caps on the second but then what the \"sloppiness\" reinis is mentioning will still be there.  \nBest solution is to ditch the word \"Design\" altogether or to give it far less importance in the mark.\n\n"
