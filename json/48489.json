Or maybe something totally different?\n\nAt first sight everything looks too bold and dominant, you must be aware of different screen resolutions. Never make the layout wider than 960pixels and remember to keep in mind some people still run 1024\\*768 which means you have to think about the vertical space aswell. The menu can’t be too thick, and the content need to get pushed to towards the top so users on low resolution will be able to see content instantly.\n\n"
