Now. If a [graphic designer](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426200159/http:/typophile.com/wiki/graphic%20designer) should arrange type well, as well, what is the difference between a graphic designer and typographer.\n\nThankyouverymuch\n\nEric\n\n",

Of course I realize that this type of blanket statement can only hold so much truth with such a large context. Iconography is very much graphic design, and it mostly does lack typography. The same could be said for my area of expertise, trademark design -- more specifically designing 'symbols' as trademarks. Although in trademarks we usually have to leverage typography to elevate the symbol to a place where it can exist without it. Example: Playboy Bunny\n\nI also grew up in a heavily wooded area and the existance of deer x-ing signs were much needed. I have acutally been in a car that hit a deer -- and let me tell you -- it is like hitting a truck.\n\nThat said, as a rule of thumb, typography exists as the cornerstone for graphic design.

Typography, illustration, photography, communication strategy, symbol development, etc. are skills required by graphic designers. There is no certification in the field so anyone with a computer and CS Suite can call themselves a graphic designer (or a typographer). The proof is in the pudding. Hrant over-generalizes by unfairly putting his \"Artiste\" label on all designers. There certainly are some out there that deserve that label but there are many who don't. This is true of many professions of course. Design is completely unregulated and good designers take the heat for what the bad ones have done. Regulation would not help any either so the buyer must beware.

Typesetters now worked for type houses (commercial typesetting) and typographers started working in either ad/design agencies, type houses or publishers.\n\nBuying galleys of phototypeset copy was an expensive proposition, so generally, type was \"spec-ed\" by trained individuals. Since so many professionals used to be quite sophisticated in type knowlege, the trade knew Sh\\*t from Shinola. Everyone had their purpose under the sun.\n\nWith the technological explosion of the last twenty years the medical profession (from doctors to technicians) has become highly differentiated into fields of expetise, but somehow the \"Graphic Arts\" workforce had a meltdown.\n\nBasically, business graphic programs began to corrupt the gene pool, and production teams were swept out with \"Desktop Publishing.\"\n\nIf you don't know (and I mean TRULY KNOW) typography, then how the hell can you even fathom the beauty and complexity of type designs.\n\nBut you know what, somehow music still seems to survive and delightfully surprise from time to time.
