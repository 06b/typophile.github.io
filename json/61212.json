  "content": "I’m currently trying to rework my school paper’s nameplate.  \nThis is what I came up with very quickly. I figured some better trained eyes might be able to help me steer in the right direction before I get too far.  \nAt this point I’m looking at the arms of the “E” and “C” and how they compare... I gave the c some added weight on the bottom to maybe compensate for the lack of weight that the e has in the middle? I’m not sure if that’s wise, but I also don’t want them to look cloned. (I’m also not liking that wedge on the e, which I attempted for the same purpose).\n\nTear it apart!\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090903124533im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Echo_3602.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Echo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090903124533/http:/typophile.com/files/Echo.gif) | 6.7 KB |\n\n",

I would actually like to use a fakir for the nameplate, but as a part money-saving method / part learning experience, I decided to try and go manual. The third is the best I think..

See how many fewer bits are involved in the ’E’, for example? This is a good example of how we can learn from signpainters. They rarely do shadows on the right, for just that reason.\n\nGood tip from Tiff. Also, now that you’ve lightened everything the crossbars on the ’H’ and ’E’ are probably a bit too light. From a distance you see TIIC or THC.\n\n"

They rarely do shadows on the right, for just that reason._\n\nAlthough I can understand the reasoning of this (the left sides of the characters are simpler). I’ve always understood is was more ’natural’ to have the light come from the left side. The shadow cast on the right side will then make the characters ’pop’ against the reading direction, towards the viewer (instead of away from the viewer).\n\n"

I’ll try altering the weight of the crossbars, and messing with the e’s.  \nMaybe the double e wouldn’t seem so evident if I stacked the words on top of each other? I’m also not liking that visual effect...  \nOthers who I’ve showed this too feel like it’s too gothic/rockband looking? Do you think that’s an issue?  \nHere’s a mock of the top of a frontpage, just to see it in context. I don’t mind the edge, really.  \nAlso keep in mind I haven’t made changes to the type itself...  \nLet me know!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090903124533im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/EchoWhite_4050.gif)\n\n"
