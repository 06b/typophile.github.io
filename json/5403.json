Warmth, softness, gentleness, human passions with dreams.   \n   \nThis says to me crude and mechanical as a jack hammer, loud and disturbing.

The stensil type so reminds me of the military and this is accross purpose with peace and love. To me it says peace and love are empty words as long as they are stamped over by military might.   \nI don't think it trys to be warm and human. I think it trys to be jarring and reminds us how words can be conscripted into service unwillingly. (Spoken by someone who has been conscripted into service unwillingly).   \n   \nChrisL\n\n"
