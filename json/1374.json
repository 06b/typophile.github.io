An enormous pity, I'm sure, and not very rational, but true as the day is long, all the same.   \n   \n_you're a historian - what field? where?_   \n   \nYou'd make a fiendish inquisitor, David. What? Where? Why? How? Prove it! Prove it!...   \n   \nMy fields are 19th and 20th century nationalist propaganda and Irish book history/typography and I'm attached to the universities of Reims and Paris 7.   \nHave I satisfied your curiosity?
