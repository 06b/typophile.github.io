The ones that are worth keeping, save in an illustrator file that you can then load as a Illustrator brush set for future projects.\n\n"

Another option is to draw unstroked paths in Illustrator, print them, trace them with calligraphy markers, and then scan those to retrace digitally.\n\n"

And while I'm no master swoosh illustrator. I definitely agree that drawing, even a simple rudimentary ornament, is the way to go if possible.\n\nOprion's brush trick is a good one. In addition to drawing shapes by hand, you can also use the spiral tool and the blend tool to create smooth shapes. But if you have difficulty using the pen tool, the only substitute is additive/subtractive combining of paths using Pathfinder.\n\nAlso, if you can draw by hand, you can scan and trace ornaments. A lot of people use this method because it frees you up to try lots of different ornament arrangements.\n\n"
