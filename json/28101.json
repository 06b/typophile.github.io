This is the kind of keener infostuff I was looking for.  \nBy the By: I started this aft looking at ivy leaves and found images and graphics of variegated leaves unlike the fleuron in question. It's designer, looking out his window, doing a line drawing for the woodcut somewhere in the UK back in the day, must have lived on the top floor of his residence: h. helix and h. hibernica have TWO leaf types. They have both palmately lobed juvenile leaves [the kind you mostly see in photos] on creeping and climbing stems, and UNLOBED cordate adult leaves on fertile flowering stems exposed to full sun, usually high in the crowns of trees or the top of rock faces. also called lovestone. OK? Thanks!!\n\n"
