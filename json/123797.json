I have no idea about the age: it's like a business card.\n\n\"_Andantino script_\" seems to be the best match, also if it isn't the exact font.\n\n"

Note the more upright stance is a better match than the inclination of the other scripts mentioned. Clip off some of the flourishing and its fairly close to your card. It even has the crossed \\_z\\_ used in your presumably Italian -- based on the phrase \\_Enza e Franco\\_ and the word \\_Via\\_ -- Business card.  \nDon\n\n"

Typefaces with hairline connections were notoriously fragile and it made sense to omit them whenever possible.  \nDon\n\n"
