However, I'm not quite convinced about Arial (which has been reinforced by this [http://typophile.com/node/119103](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414175417/http:/typophile.com/node/119103) interesting discussion).\n\nWhat I think works pro-Arial is that the font is so neutral that the Brandon headlines are empahised, but that's about it.\n\nFor some specific parts of text I'm using Brandon as well, but the major part will be another font. I've considered a Google workhorse like Open Sans or Source Sans Pro, but as they are less \"clean\" than Arial, the contrast with the headlines is somewhat softened.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",
