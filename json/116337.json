Norms, colours, styles, behaviours and ideals have frequently been reattributed from one side of the supposed gender divide to the other. Rather than positing a historically untenable biological just-so explanation for the different gender associations type has, a much more fruitful path would be to examine how exactly a certain agglomeration of lines and curves has come to be understood as \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" in the discourse about them.\n\n(And what about queer and transsexual type?
