The lowercase and smallcap \"z\", however, seem out of place, probably due to the rounded angles. (I recognize the constraints you face when you get that small.)   \n   \nWhat can you share about your design process? Did you build it directly in a bitmap editor or did you draw it pixel-for-pixel in Photoshop?   \n   \njb\n\n"

      "content": "Mmm, you know, you're probably right about the Z's... I thought they seemed a little \"off\" while I was making them but I didn't think of any other way they could look.   \n   \nFirst step in the design process was Photoshop at 1600% zoom with a one-pixel pencil/eraser, for quick experimentation and such. Then in Fontographer I used the rectangle tool in conjunction with snap-to-grid to recreate the shapes as outlines.   \n   \nDesigning this font, I am constantly beset with fear that I'm unwittingly plagiarizing other people's work, but I suppose when one is designing a five-pixel high \"E\" there are only so many possibilities available. The one character I'm fairly sure is unique is the lowercase Y; but maybe I just haven't done enough reading...   \n   \nAnd yes, this is the first \"draft\" of the typeface.\n\n"

      "content": "Really nice work!   \nI'd like to see how this would look as a normal face (full size scaleable). It sure looks handsome.   \n   \nThere was mentioned the smallcaps and lowercase 'z' falling out in relation to the rest of the typeface, I have the same feeling towards the smallcaps and lowercase 'x'. When looking at the 'x' it seems too wide.   \n   \nIt is by far a richer 8-bit character set i've seen and looks promising.   \n   \n(By the way..im new here and will watch out this space as I'm working on several character sets myself and would like some constructive and qualified critique when I feel the time is right for it.)   \n   \nGood luck!!!   \n   \nYours,   \nSbo\n\n"

      "content": "You've nailed the small caps in relation to the the U&lc. Many fonts out there use a 'unicase' approach for variety (including one of my own), whereas you've created something much richer.   \n   \nI wouldn't be concerned about the \"embarrassment of riches\" in terms the number of bitmap faces out there. The majority of them could only be called alphabets--with no attempt at serious punctuation, let alone international characters. Kudos for that.   \n   \n//joe\n\n"
