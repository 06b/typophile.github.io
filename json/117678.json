  "content": "Greetings! A strange issue in a font created in FontLab:\n\nFrom the same vfb file I have generated both ttf and otf versions of the font. In the otf version there is spurious inter-character kerning within Uniscribe applications; this does not occur in other applications, e.g., TeX.\n\nCompare the screenshots linked below. The second line contains repetitions of the character U+0640, which is exactly the width of a monospaced box. In the ttf shot you see the repetitions form a continuum, whereas in the otf shot they are discrete. Looking at the Latin letters on the first line the spurious kerning is also apparent. (You may ignore the hinting discrepancies).\n\nHas anyone here ever run into anything like this before? Any ideas? Thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809090300im_/http:/typophile.com/files/almfixed-ttf_5778.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809090300im_/http:/typophile.com/files/almfixed-otf_6388.jpg)\n\n",
