  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI was wondering if someone could help me. I used two different fonts for this invitation. I think one of them is “Poetica” (don’t know for sure) and the other? I made this by hand (cutting out the letters and sticking them onto another piece of paper and making a copy of that), so there is no electronic file left too look at.\n\nI want to make a new invitation using the same type, but I want to make it in Indesign at my school so if your looking at this and have an opinion about the (mis)use of these two fonts together feel free to comment.\n\nThanks for reading any help greatly appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [uitnodiging.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830010013/http:/typophile.com/files/uitnodiging.pdf) | 174.95 KB |\n\n [‹ pls help recognize typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830010013/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18331 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [looking for a font for an non-existant language ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830010013/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18304 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
