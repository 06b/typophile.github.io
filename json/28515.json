I was offered [Caracteres](http://web.archive.org/web/20130118043042/http:/simplythebest.net/fonts/fonts/caracteres.html) as a possible match, yet the Mac .sit did not contain any font files. Can anybody help me out?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130118043042im_/http:/typophile.com/files/michelin_signs_3722.jpg)\n\n",
