Does the new auto-activation work as well as Suitcase? What font management would you recommend?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "I have experienced the same frustration with both Suitcase and Font Book. No matter what software you use, it's good to keep in mind that fonts can be very volatile to operating systems, especially in large numbers.\n\nThat being said, you may want to test drive [Font Explorer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219021709/http:/www.fontexplorerx.com/) by Monotype.\n\nI've had to stress test and implement font management to a large team of artists in the past, and everywhere that Suitcase came up short, Font Explorer excelled. It seemed to handle large numbers of activated fonts a little better than Suitcase, and they have auto-activation plug-ins for many of the common Adobe products. As well, you really can't beat the depth of the program. It can even show you broken down character maps by language and the kerning pairs of different fonts. I think they just released the PC version about a year or two ago, so it's for either platform now, and it's well supported/updated (by Monotype).\n\nBest of luck in your search!\n\n"

I find that there's not enough real \"management\" options with FontBook.\n\nI tend to activate groups of fonts temporarily, or on a per-project basis, and Suitcase is well-suited to my way of working (it helps that I've used it for many years and it has nearly always worked this way).\n\nWe use Universal Type Server at my current job, and it's basically Suitcase Lite (from the user's POV).\n\n"

I wish they could include them on **Suitcase Fusion**.\n\n"

      "content": "When I was preparing to leave Extensis a few weeks ago, I test drove font Explorer for a couple of weeks, to decide if I wanted to switch. I had a brand new laptop to configure.\n\nI liked Font Explorer's OpenType support, language info, and character map showings. Both it and Suitcase Fusion have plug-ins for current and recent Creative Suite/Cloud apps. Font Explorer supports more antique versions, though.\n\nIn the end, what drove me nuts about Font Explorer was that its “family groupings” were only the style-linked groupings. No more than four members to a family. So a mega-family like Kepler would show up as 40+ families in Font Explorer, but I could show it as just one in Suitcase Fusion.\n\nSo Font Explorer was just too unwieldy for me, based on that. I switched back to Suitcase Fusion. I may occasionally miss some FEX features, but at least I am not going crazy every single day.\n\n"

For exemple :  \n**Avenir** {Avenir Roman, Avenir Oblique},  \n**Avenir Black** {Avenir Black},  \n**Avenir Black Oblique** {Avenir Black Oblique},  \n**Avenir Book** {Avenir Book Roman, Avenir Book Oblique},  \netc.\n\n"

But I've uninstalled it since, so perhaps I was missing something.\n\nNote however that if the font producer doesn't set up the fonts correctly, the font management app can't really work around that. I have certainly seen fonts from some foundries that did not behave well in this regard, in _any_ font manager.\n\n"
