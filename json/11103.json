Try going to:   \n   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/Search?what=fonts&searchtext=script](http://web.archive.org/web/20120504011442/http:/www.myfonts.com/Search?what=fonts&searchtext=script)   \n   \nand browse through the script options. You may find a suitable substitute. Good luck!   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
