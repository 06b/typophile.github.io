The bold weight was reminiscent of coffee house grotesk typefaces of the 1920s, while the lighter versions were supposed to bridge the gap to contemporary type design. The current [FF Kava](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134046/http:/fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_kava_ot/) family is a carefully revised, more rounded version of the old Kaffeesatz fonts. A [black weight](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134046/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_kava_ot_black/) has been added as well as [small caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134046/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_kava_ot_regular/?&acs_ss=17) and more [figure sets](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134046/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_kava_ot_regular/?&acs_pt=48&acs_ss=11) to form now an attractive modern and soft sans serif type family.\n\nRead the complete story and try it out on [The FontFeed](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134046/http:/fontfeed.com/html/archives/new-fontfonts-ff-kava-with-extra-flavour/).\n\n[\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134046im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FF-Kava-by-LiveSurface_500_4247.jpg)\n](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134046/http:/fontfeed.com/html/archives/new-fontfonts-ff-kava-with-extra-flavour/)  \n_FF Kava: Ideal for packaging [Image: LifeSurface®]_\n\n",
