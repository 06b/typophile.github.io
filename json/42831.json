Now, I cannot find a trace of the thread, in my own trackback or anywhere on Typophile.\n\nI think I might be responsible for the disappearance of the thread, because of a followup post where I unthinkingly used the ’less than’ sign a few times, thereby messing up the html tags of the page. Or it might be a simple database glitch, unless someone has deliberated erased the thread.\n\nFor the record, two equally valid ways to write 100% in Korean are:\n\n백 퍼센트 (_baek peosenteu_; from “percent”) and 백 프로 (_baek peuro_; from “pro”)\n\n [‹ Misuse of 'edit' feature](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042941/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42737 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Malicious TrueType fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042941/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42758 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
