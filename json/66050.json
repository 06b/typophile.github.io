Is there a possibility to implement OpenType in Flash or do I have to do it with Actionscript? And can I somehow use these Contextual Alternates in Flash?  \nI am trying to do something like this in flash:\n\n[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=liza&id2=test](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122201907/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=liza&id2=test \"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=liza&id2=test\")\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n",
