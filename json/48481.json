As you would expect many of these companies don't have the money or knowhow to create a snazzy logo (or website) so we're designing it for them.\n\nRight now I'm working on [Baja by Kayak](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425045337/http:/bajabykayak.com/)\n\nTheir current \"logo\":\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425045337im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gen_643_6540.1.gif)\n\nMy new design (in progress):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425045337im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kayak_6592.gif)\n\nThere's no special reason for the \"A\" to stand out, and I'm not especially attached to the colors. Also I haven't yet figured out how the \"Baja by\" text will be incorporated so feel free to offer an ideas. :)\n\n",

However, if their customers are mostly people _already_ traveling through the area then Kayak's more important.\n\nIf you really felt the need to emphasize one word over the other, you could perhaps create two versions: a Kayak one for all signage and local advertising, and a Baja one for the company website and ads targeting international travelers.\n\n"
