      "content": "Just came across this post in my search for a new typographic poster for my walls. After spending hours and days searching for the right one, I finally found Danish design agency Playtype. Wow, they have done some amazingly simple and minimalistic posters. Just wanted to share with other typo-lovers :-) btw. found them here: [www.theposterclub.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223160125/http:/www.theposterclub.com/ \"www.theposterclub.com\") - ended up buying two and got free shipping. So happy :-)\n\n"
