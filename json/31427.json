For instance, many people don't like [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20141015225122/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura) for body copy because of the long ascenders/low x-height (aside from the sans/serif debate). They say it breaks up the color too much. Same thing for other typefaces with low x-heights like Venetians.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense to me. Presumably, the larger x-height makes the letters appear larger. But that means that you need to increase the leading proportionately to compensate. If you used a typeface with a low x-height at a larger point size, wouldn't you basically have the same results?\n\n",

      "content": "[Edit:This was cross-posted with Nick & Hrant's interesting observations.]\n\nI am also interested in the relationship of readability and economy in type design.\n\nWith a larger x-height, you will generally get higher legibility at smaller sizes. However, from what I've learned so far the x-height is is only one of a number of interrelated factors, and that in fact determining what is the best 'value' in terms of the combination of readability and economy is quite complex.\n\nIf you normalize two faces so that their x-heights are the same on the paper, you will find the following make a difference to the readability-economy issue.\n\n1. Set width.  \nThe length of a lower case alphabet in different fonts will be very different, even when their x-height are made the same. Eg. Baskerville is wider than Times New Roman. The narrower font would be more economical, other things being equal (which they never are).\n\n2. Ascenders and Descenders.  \nIf you use less leading, you can get more letters on the page. The length of the ascenders and descenders will limit how tightly you can lead, as Stephen notes above. However there are other factors that also affect how tightly you can lead with good readability so this may not in fact be an advantage.\n\n3. Darkness of the typeface. I just learned this from Mitchell & Wightman's 'Book Typography'. They compare Quadraat, a dark face with a relatively large x-height and Spectrum, a light face with a relatively smaller x-height. Quadraat requires more leading to look not excessively dark on the page, and Spectrum needs to be relatively tightly leaded not to look too light. In their illustration 11/15 Quadraat and 12/14 Spectrum are about equally readable, and Spectrum ends up being more economical, even though it has a smaller-x-height.\n\n4. Optical Size. What makes this issue particularly tricky is that the trade-offs are different at different optical sizes. For example, if you go down to 9 point, probably Spectrum will be not very readable, and Quadraat will shine.\n\nIn general my feeling is that at smaller text sizes, large x-height becomes a distinct advantage, but at larger text sizes, it can be even a disadvantage. And then at display sizes it can even reverse again. So in fact this issue is really complicated.\n\nI haven't even mentioned letter spacing and sans-serifs, both of which add more wrinkles.\n\nI would be interested in the observations and experience of others in handling this readability-economy issue.\n\n"

      "content": "\"...I began by getting myself a fount of Roman type. And here what I wanted was letter pure in form; severe, without needless excrescences; solid, without the thickening and thinning of the line, which is the essential fault of the ordinary modern type, and which makes it difficult to read; and not compressed laterally, as all later type has grown to be owing to commercial exigencies.\"\n\nAims in founding the Kelmscott Press, William Morris, 1895\n\nInteresting how the original post asked only about readability, but economy immediately crept into the discussion.\n\nIn academic textbook publishing, \"economy\" tilts the other way. Publishers are desperate to produce a physical object that appears worthy of a $125 price tag, with no regard for the future back health of students slinging bookbags over one shoulder. Considerably down-market, technical how-to guides e.g. \"Make Windows Sing\" are bought by the word, sold by the pound. Economy in the sense discussed here isn't at issue.\n\nIf one designs without concern for economy, there's an optimal size and leading that shows each font at its best. Then, and only then, one can ask which font provides the most comfortable long-term reading. I'd say the x-height sweet spot is clearly somewhere in the middle. For example, Lucida Bright is often used in top-drawer technical guides, but to my tastes its x-height is too large.\n\nTo me, a small x-height font like Bernhard Modern screams \"I'm upper crust!\" I can't get past that, I wouldn't want it on anything but a concert invitation. Yet, it's surprisingly readable. Go figure.\n\nRemember that much of the world does just fine reading arabic, which at first glance looks like a flatlining EKG, with barely any x-height at all.\n\nI'd say that what goes on within the x-height strip determines much of readability. The height of that strip may be largely immaterial.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141015225122im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Concert_3827.jpg)\n\n"

You say that there is an x-height 'sweet spot' for reading comfort, but you also say that for readability \"the [x] height may be immaterial\". These seem to me to be saying opposite things.\n\nNick, I find your comments on ITC Garamond and on Newspaper type extremely interesting.\n\nOne of the things that I have admired in metal Caslons is the way they could be set with relatively little leading, and form a lovely woven texture on the page.\n\nYou said wrote that this advantage of longer extenders is important in longer measures, such as in a book. But I am wondering whether the failure of ITC Garamond as a text type is more because of other features.\n\nCarl Crossgrove wrote in an interesting post in another thread that the problem with ITC Garamond is that it has a huge x-height suitable for a very small size, but the tight spacing, fine serifs and other details suitable for a display type. I'm wondering whether its problems in text aren't for these reasons. If Carl's analysis is correct, I would expect ITC Garamond also not to work in narrow columns for extended text.\n\nWhat do you think the other factors are, in addition to extender height, in making a type work for narrow columns on one hand, and broad columns on the other?\n\nMy other question concerns the reducing of cap height that you pointed out in newspaper type. What is the advantage of it in your view? Have you followed this model in your own newspaper types?\n\n"

You have to factor in usage and objective along with the physical determinates such as line length, leading, cap height, and so on.

However, ITC Garamond was great in heads, and for that genre of 1980s ad with 18/16 pt text type wrapped round a close-cropped image. (Yes, it is possible to reverse-lead ITC Garamond! -- although my favorite for that kind of setting was ITC Berkeley).\n\nIt's also the weight of capitals that has been reduced in news text type, as well as their height.\n\nIn general, I think that solid leading has become unacceptable, across the board. It used to be a quite legitimate setting style (Morison's \"Principles\" was set solid in a large Bembo), but no more. Perhaps we can put the blame on Microsoft, and the 20% leading default of word processors, which, now that everyone with a computer is a typesetter, has become the norm.\n\nAlso, now that designers have become typesetters, and are not a s skilled as the pros of yore, an easy way to make your text type look upscale, professional and artful, is to lead it copiously.\n\n"

      "content": "I only have a few observations to add to this fascinating discussion. As usual, largely those of a reader of books.\n\nMy basic point, I think, is that so far as I can see _all_ generalizations about readability are suspect. So much depends on the context: what measure something is set at, how it is printed, what sort of type the reader of that sort of work is used to seeing, how the book is printed. Take even ITC Garamond. Quite close to universally loathed, the acme of unreadability. But I remember having to spend quite a lot of time with the computer books published by O'Reilly, which were set in ITC Garamond, and I don't recall them as unreadable at all. For their purpose, given the overall design and the way you read that sort of book, they worked very well.\n\nSo generalizations are suspect. But, having said that, let me offer one of my own. For extended reading most types that are in any way _extreme_ tend to be difficult. Maybe that's because they are obtrusive. Maybe it's for some other reason. For that reason I would be suspect of statements like \"larger\" (or \"smaller\") X for greater readability ... because I would tend to think that \"very average\" X was likely to make, in general, for good readibility, allowing for a fairly wide variation. (This applies not just to x-height but to other features too: \"very dark for good readability\", \"very light for good readability\", \"very low cap height for good readability\" etc etc: all suspect.)\n\nAnd finally, on the topic of economy, I do think that one tends to find that a saving in one area tends to mean a loss in another. In general (I don't say always), large x-height tends to want more leading, so that the fact you can set in a small nominal point-size does not save so much space as you might at first hope. And compressed type means you can fit more letters in the line, but again tends to call for slightly more leading (or a shorter line) to prevent doubling, etc etc. From that point of view I suspect that large x-height types are most useful from the point of view of economy where neither readability over an extended period nor beauty is really a concern, but where cramming in matters. In other words, where one's concern is not so much _readability_, at least over any extended period, so much as _legibility_ (e.g. dictionaries, tables, . For \"classic\" book-width type intended for extended reading, I suspect that large x-height letters are no great advantage.\n\nAnd I think they're ugly ... but maybe that's just me.\n\n"

Within the actual typeface, I think the most important variables are these (for a general-use book face):\n\nWeight/color; is the type strong on the page, not thin and light?  \nContrast: Not too high (Bodoni), not too low (Futura)  \nDefault spacing: the sweet spot where the words knit together evenly and clearly and word spaces are \"just right\"  \nClear, strong, differentiated character shapes; ambiguity is bad  \nCap/lc/extender proportions: not aboslute numbers but a pleasing relationship\n\nEven with these variables optimized, there are the intangibles; is the type too showy, is there any movement or activity in it, or is it static, regular, dull? Some of the most comfortable, and I might even say inspiring, text faces out there have moderate x-height, low contrast or some other \"flaw\" but so much about them is ideal, we enjoy reading even chemistry textbooks set in them. Because of this, I think it's useless to pursue the discrete ingredients of readability. See Michael Pollan's recent articles on \"nutrition\" in the NYT for a parallel.\n\n"

He found that the print in Le Monde - composed in Times New Roman, which The Times of London itself abandoned in 1971 - was less than ideal compared to the other papers'. The types used nowadays had greater x-heights and smaller capitals and ascenders. Because little of the text is set in capitals, there was no need to make them monumental as Stanley Morison's committee had done for Times New Roman in 1931.\"\n\n"

I believe that it was the application of kerning tables to text setting in the early 1970s phototype, and the tight look that infatuated typographers for a couple of decades, that prompted the abandonment of monumental capital proportions, and the move to more similar stem weight between the cases -- the terrible grayness of photoset text. During the digital era, the balance is somewhere between metal and photo era.\n\n"

Also the Carter font seems lighter than Le Monde Journal, whose color was designed to match the earlier Times New Roman that Le Monde used.\n\nI don't see the relative weight of the caps and lower case as being that different.\n\nIs there a general trend for less extreme shortening of ascenders and caps in Newspapers?\n\n"

But it shouldn't be news to anybody that mathematically slightly heavier caps prevents them from looking too light next to the lc. My point was that visibly darker caps are generally intended to break even color, but this can be useful sometimes.\n\nWilliam, concerning the headline font what would be nice to add to that comparison is what came in between: De Groot's superb Floris; serious but attractive, and very French in my eyes.\n\nhhp\n\n"

There are some quite light strokes in there, and the much improved (less gain) printing of newspapers today also allows for a compact setting, without an overly heavy overall effect. \n"
