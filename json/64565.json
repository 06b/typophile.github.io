  "content": "I just downloaded the latest Office 2010 beta, and the Opentype feature support seems to have expanded more since the Technical Preview. You can get to far more features now. If you have 3.5GB of space lying around, try it out.\n\nSo far (after ten minutes of experimentation with just Gabriola) my only complaint is that the implementation of Stylistic Sets is mutually exclusive, against the spec. You cannot turn on multiple stylistic sets at once. So for example, something like Hypatia Sans, where stylistic sets toggle individual alternates for fine control, is crippled in this application.\n\nI will write feedback requesting that they modify the interface to change ss01-ss20 to checkboxes instead of a pulldown. Has anyone here had direct contact with the specific MS employee interested in this and capable of addressing it?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414044840im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GabriolaWord201050pct_6311.png)\n\n",

My hat is off to Messrs. Hudson &or Mills [edit: I originally called him \"Ross\" implying \"Mr. Ross\" and not \"Mr. Mills.\" --JB] &or whoever wrote that CALT code. I'm wondering if there are also some many-to-one substitutions going on in there.

      "content": "_my only complaint is that the implementation of Stylistic Sets is mutually exclusive_\n\nYes, that is a problem, although not in the case of Gabriola, whose Stylistic Set lookups are designed to be mutually exclusive.\n\nRegarding how Gabriola works: there are just about every kind of GSUB lookup employed. Stylistic Sets 6 and 7 make heavy use of contextual one-to-many substitutions: the big independent swash forms are zero-width glyphs that are inserted into the glyph string according to contextual rules. When I started the project, I wasn't sure there would be any applications in which I could even test these lookups, since MS didn't support the features and Adobe didn't support one-to-many substitutions, but by the time I'd finished the font Adobe had finally implemented that support, and now MS Publisher and Word are going to support the features.\n\nI did all the OTL feature work myself. Ross hinted the font, with advice from Mike Duggan. I can't say I actually understand how it is hinted, but apparently it is a relatively novel approach.\n\n"

      "content": "Oh yes, and I meant \"one-to-many\" when I wrote \"many-to-one.\" I would like to finally attempt a Latin font that employs one-to-many. You can completely redo connecting strokes using modular bits instead of grafting them on to every glyph and amassing hundreds of tedious variants. Of course I suppose in reality it will prove more complex. Does anything on the Apple side support one-to-many in Opentype yet? Aside from CS4 of course. Mellel perhaps?\n\n"

      "content": "I use VOLT.\n\nI believe Mellel should work with one-to-many lookups. And perhaps also Apple's own OT support? Try TextEdit.\n\nI've played with the idea of making a Latin connecting script font that splits letters into left and right side halves. I would use the 'curs' GPOS feature to tie them together -- even though there are no vertical offsets and the attachments would all be 0,0 -- because otherwise you risk the letters being broken apart by tracking (of course, you probably want to discourage users from tracking a script font anyway, but users will do the darndest things).\n\nThe tricky issue would be overlap of joins, ensuring that rounding doesn't produce stem offsets or dropped pixels. This is less of an issue with subpixel rendering than it used to be. For full pixel rendering, you want an overlap of 70 units on 2048 to ensure no drop out.\n\n"
