  "content": "I was trying to replicate the appearance of this portion of the Anglican Missal, and was stymied in trying to identify the main body face. In particular, the lower-case “r” with its slight upward reach, and the “g” (which I know should be a giveaway) elude me. It looks a little like a Clarendon, and little like a Cheltenham, but not exactly like either, to my eye.\n\nI promise I'll moan, smack my forehead, and say “Of course!” if the answer is as obvious as I fear it will be.\n\nMany thanks —\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Gloucester Old Style \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [DPape](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202353/http:/typophile.com/user/3945 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-10-29 at 11.03.03.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202353/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-29%20at%2011.03.03.png) | 95.06 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "That was my observation as well — it should be a giveaway, but I can't spot it in another face.\n\nIt compares interestingly to Berthold Sorbonne and Paratype Academy, but these are slightly higher in contrast, and without the reaching “r” and (I notice, not in the sample) relatively straight lower-case “f”.\n\nThe whole of the Anglican Missal is curious, as it is composed of separate bodies of prayers set in differing faces. The bit I’m looking at now is “Prayers Before Mass,” but each subsequent section employs slightly (or markedly) different type. The “Proper Masses” section uses a face whose “r” is more conventional, and whose “l” upper serifs are angled rather than square.\n\nIf you’re interested, it’s at [Archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202353/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Farchive.org/details/anglicanmissal00churuoft).\n\n"
