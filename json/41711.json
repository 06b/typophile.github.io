Unless you can find other examples of using this 'font' for more than this logo, I think you have to consider that maybe this lettering was done freehand.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I would have been equally pleased to find out that it was freehand, and if that were the case I was hoping that somebody in the community would know who was responsible.\n\nAt any rate, it might inspire to take up arms and draw the rest of the alphabet as a learning experiment.\n\n"
