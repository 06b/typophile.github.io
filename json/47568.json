      "content": "Discussion of this topic is long overdue. Pick up a bone.\n\nReally, HTML syntax is a positively archaic ancestor of the simplified text formatting the rest of the web moved on to years ago. Wiki-style syntax is the future for things like bold and italic. By comparison HTML sytax is not merely \"too complicated\", it's primitive and obsolete. Typing two underscores or two inch marks is much easier, and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nTypophile and Punchcut are clinging to a standard that will soon be redundant. For a community that is supposedly type central, this kind of thing started to get embarrassing several years ago.\n\n_If you find remembering/typing HTML too complicated, you can always use tools like TextExpander, RapidoWrite or Typinator. With them, you can type “\\_\\_” or whatever you have configured, and it will automatically replace that with [strong][/strong], and even place the cursor between those tags, if you want so._\n\nHe shouldn't have to resort to such ludicrous methods and neither should anyone else.\n\n_Can we have some more HTML elements, please? blockquote, first and foremost. The availability of del, ins or abbr would not be amiss either._\n\nI think we should have more elements like that but not in HTML please. Let's move with the times.\n\n_And as this is a typographic forum, I can see quite a few reasonable applications for i and b: Not every italicization is meant to be an emphasis._\n\nThat's an arbitrary and not very meaningful distinction. i tags produce the same formatting as em, and b tags produce the same formatting as strong. What's the point? None that can be discerned, except b and i are to type. Nobody reading it will see any difference. Besides which b and i are ageing, non-standard, non-compliant Mozilla extensions.\n\n_C’mon, give it a break! :D_\n\nC'mon and give users a break, and move with the times. No wonder typophiles and the type industry hang onto outmoded terminology like \"sans serif\".\n\nPick up a bone and throw it into the sky. Watch it spin off into space.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
