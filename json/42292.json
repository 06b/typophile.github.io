      "content": "The radiation symbol looks a bit much like an old fashioned computer tape reel, but I doubt there is much that can be done about that. Maybe lightning the outer circle to the stroke weight of the skull and bones will help, along with lengthening the fan blades.\n\nMaking the ring a little larger in the biohazard symbol might make it read better.\n\nVery nice skull and bones. The teeth are going to be reduced beyond recognition at text sizes but the rest should hold up.\n\nI quite often see a rain cloud (cloud with slashes underneath) on the local weather reports instead of an umbrella. Does Unicode specify “umbrella” for that position or just “rain” (or are you making this set up without regard for established Unicode symbols)? You’ll need a black cloud with a lightning bolt dropping from it for thunderstorms, if you don’t have one already. I’ll have to defer to people who live with snow for an opinion on the snowman vs. snowflake controversy.\n\nBack up to your first two rows, the planetary symbols seem just fine but some of the others seem a touch too light. I’m a bit rusty on which of those is which, though.\n\n"

But it just seems like a symbolic mistake, if what is intended is the meterological conditions “rain” & “snow”. But I am not 100% clear how they are used. Maybe I am grouping unlike things...\n\nMaybe I will reduce the # of teeth on the skull. The radiation symbol is set, as is the biohazard but I think they could be tweaked in the ways you suggest.\n\nThe lighter astronomical symbols are meant to be lighter than the main symbols but my question is “how much is ideal?”. I may be sweating some of this too much but I want to make this as fine as I am able to.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick, I see. You are right that columnar alignment would not be broken. The only place this would matter would be be in programmers code where using a doubled glyph would create an opportunity for a mis-count at a glance. 105 glyphs with one of these would look like 106 spaces were being taken. It is unlikely that a programer would use one of these glyphs to program with. But - I think when you use a mono you expect it to play by certain rules. When/if this ever becomes a regular sans Font I will make the adjustments you suggested.\n\n"
