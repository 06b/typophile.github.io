  "content": "I am doing a \"quick and dirty\" scanning-retouch and fontographer coding of an client's handwriting. So far I made a template for the artist to write in each character. Budget is only allows for 8 hours billable. I know this is properly not enough time, but will be making it up on the site which is the next job. I am used to doing it the long and hard way with letter by letter, but can't afford the time. Any suggestions for short cuts. How about a link to a company that can do this. I want to see what is offered in the current market for this sort of work. I think FontShop used to do it but I can't find it on their site any more.\n\n",
