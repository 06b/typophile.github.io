It is unfortunate that I could not find a higher resolution image. This is a serif font with thick, not round, commas. The second image shows the font in italics as well.\n\nThank you very much!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Stone Serif \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [akira1975](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160713/http:/typophile.com/user/4504 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Captureedir.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160713/http:/typophile.com/files/Captureedir.jpg) | 1.98 KB |\n\n",
