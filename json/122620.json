It shaped the identity and distinction of the Malays in the past. Jawi also acts as a link between culture and religion as the Arabic letters are being used in the Holy Quran.  \nHowever, Jawi has been losing its relevance due to the modernisation of culture and the introduction of the Romanised Bahasa Melayu (Rumi). Thus, let us now take baby steps to recognise Jawi rekindle our love for this art.  \nConducted by brother Hazrin Mohamad, founder and creative director of HAZWORKZ, the Art Of Jawi Workshop aims to explore a more contemporary aspect of Jawi where the idea of Jawi calligraphy will be introduced. Besides that, basic reading and writing of Jawi will be taught as well. You can visit Haz Workz fb page to his works and art. Its Facinating!!!  \nSo, what are you waiting for? Come on down and join us to grab this \"exclusive\" chance towards rediscovering our heritage as well as the revival of Jawi!  \nDetails  \nPROGRAM ITINERARY  \n10.00 am – 11.15 am Introduction of Jawi Alphabets & History  \n11.15 am – 12.00 pm Break (Short Brunch)  \n12.00 pm – 12.45 pm Introduction of Jawi Calligraphy  \n12.45 pm – 13.00 pm Short Break  \n1.00 pm – 2.00 pm Continuation of Calligraphy  \n2.00 pm End of event  \nPURCHASE OF TICKETS  \nRSVP on our event page ( [https://www.facebook.com/events/731627836933067](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317125120/https:/www.facebook.com/events/731627836933067 \"https://www.facebook.com/events/731627836933067\")) and email your details directly (full name and contact number) to [mcms@mymail.sim.edu.sg](mailto:mcms@mymail.sim.edu.sg).
