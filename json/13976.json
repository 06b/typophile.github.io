      "content": "FontShop is like the name says at first a SHOP. Over the past they have expanded their portfolio selling stock photos, books and other goodies like FontShop Germany. So, someone could think, they partly lost their focus on type. Others say they had a different focus all the time. This is the reason for some serious designers and foundries to avoid FontShop as valuable distributer. In fact, FontShop would be a very valuable distributer. They dont like the shopping flair, they dont want to be a needle in heap of hay.\n\n— [astype.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20060504203605/http:/www.astype.de/)—\n\n"
