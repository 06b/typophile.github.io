Is there a difference between clothing you find at Wal-Mart and what you find at boutique shops? yes, they all do the same thing, namely clothe the body, but some with more flair and personality. Some labels are known for high quality workmanship. some are known for quick and dirty digitizations. some people are brand-loyal to certain foundries. I say the market should dictate prices, because if a foundry isn’t paying their bills, they will change their policies so that they can.\n\n"

If I understand the book correctly, Goudy sold his fonts by the pound.\n\nDoes anyone know what the rationale was for pricing by weight? Was that standard practice? Was there a standard price per pound, or did foundaries set their price per pound for a font in accordance with what they considered the quality of the product and the demand for it?\n\nDoes the way that digital type is priced have any similarity to how metal type was priced?\n\n"

      "content": "Some thoughts:\n\nA problem I see with likening type to the motor vehicle or fashion industry is that the perceived differences in quality is very subjective.\n\n’Quality’ type is given its distinction for an almost limitless array of subjective reasons. Whereas the workmanship, physical materials and overall workings of a motor vehicle or fashion item is more easily distinguished. Distinguishing a Mercedes to a Kia, and Prada to a Target is very easy. The higher prices of a Mercedes and Prada are justified, to the reasonable ’average’ person.\n\nFocussing on these subjective qualities, likening type pricing to artistic works, such as paintings also has downfalls. Most obviously paintings are unique, and type is a ’software’ - make once sell many.\n\nAnd continuing on, likening type pricing to software perhaps has its problems. I dont think the ’average’ person respects font EULAs as highly as software packages.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is technology. Improving type technology to enable subscription based font usage (the way software is going these days), and forcing user registrations and respect of EULAs.\n\nPerhaps the currently limited type technologies have left us with this interesting issue of pricing type.\n\n"

Whereas the workmanship, physical materials and overall workings of a motor vehicle or fashion item is more easily distinguished.”\n\nOn the contrary, there are a number of very clear differences in the actual quality (usefulness, versatility, reliability) of different typefaces. Only one of those is design quality. Other measurable ingredients in a font’s quality are performance on screen, completeness or usefulness of character set, outline quality (which affects output performance), thoroughness of design, spacing, and kerning. There are fonts out there worth nothing, and there are fonts out there worth hundreds of dollars. Ask very experienced graphic designers whether they would prefer to rely on Adobe Garamond, for example, or an unkerned freeware student font with no numerals and no punctuation, caps only. One can be used for thousands of uses, and is therefore more valuable to the user. The other may never prove to be useful for anything.\n\nRedge, my initial thought about your thread topic is that due to the radical difference in the market for type, from any previous type market, we’re all making it up as we go along. It would be difficult to model font pricing on any other model, since delivery, storage, generation, design, use, and distribution are all utterly new for us.\n\n"

These are the Ford users, who get their type from Adobe or (shudder, free sites off the net).\n\nBut other companies want a more exclusive image, and choose type that is less common. It may not be better built than Adobe’s but it will have lower exposure. This is the Mercedes buyer, who is willing to pay a bit more for some semi-exclusivity.\n\n(You also have the Lamborgini buyer, who commissions a face and refuses to let the artist sell to anyone else.)\n\nOf course, because the Mercedes type will not be sold as often as the Ford type, it needs to be priced at a higher level.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>Disclaimer</cite>, I’ve just had a bottle of red, so if the following doesn’t make any sense, just disregard this post. ;^)\n\n-\n\nWell, this is called perceived value, if you position your product to the market effectively to the point it is viewed as “prestige” and more “luxurious” like the TEFF and DTL fonts. They’ve succeeded this to some extent that you’re not likely to find fonts of the same quality\\*. But this isn’t always the case, you could price your fonts higher to create a perceived value. This is the problem, experienced graphic designers and typographers can usually pick out the wannabes, others fall to this trap.\n\nI think Paul’s analogy of the type industry to the fashion industry is fairly true, sure you’re bound to find some fluctuation in type, font and/or design quality relative to pricing but reputation and perceived market value is often always established upon quality work. Like fashion, if someone comes out with staggering work <cite>regularly</cite> or even once or twice, they’ve built up a reputation quickly and perceived value comes along with that. The better your reputation, the higher you can price your fonts, this is good business, who wouldn’t take advantage of that? But like any business, you need to retain that value by maintaining the competitive advantage (quality or unique fonts etc.) or you will lose money.\n\nReally, I don’t see anything complicated or unusual about font pricing. Like fashion, <cite>prestige</cite> brands are expensive, <cite>reliable</cite> brands are priced above average and the rest set the standard pricing. If you don’t agree with the pricing, buy something similar that is cheaper, just like you’d buy a cheaper shirt. Free fonts are perceived, often rightly, to be of bad quality. Just like free shirts are crunchy and uncomfortable. ;^)\n\n\\* I recently received printed samples from TEFF and I think the quality of their fonts is astounding, but not incomparable to say some fonts by Font Bureau or Porchez which are more competitively priced. I still think TEFF and DTL are a bit over the top just like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent etc. I don’t buy Gucci shirts... but I want them...\n\n"

(This is assuming a static format, but I’m figuring OpenType is good for 15-20 years which is close enough to forever for the software industry.)\n\nSo, with pricing, you’re not only looking at how many people will buy a given font, but also at the fact that once they’ve bought it, they won’t buy it again. Would lower prices grow the market enough to compensate for that? I don’t know.\n\nI have, however, noted that some of the companies who seem to be doing very well in retail type appear to have raised their prices rather than lowered them.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

Obviously it isn’t _the_ most important thing, but without a EULA that allows for the things you wish to do you might as well give up.\n\nI agree with the idea of exclusivity in regards to font pricing. However, that goes only so far as some of the aforementioned foundries really are pricing themselves out of the general playing field. But, I presume they do this with great thought and consideration. I don’t fault them for the pricing, but also think they are too high for most people who do license type.\n\nFashion is a great comparison as it is more disposable than a car. You can keep the items in your closet well after they have lost their original luster and then dig them out again when the trends comes back around. Also, the idea of building a foundation in your closet of good quality basics and then splurging on some cheap/expensive trendier items.\n\n"
