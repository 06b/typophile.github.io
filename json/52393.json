This is just a flat comp and will eventually be a working site.\n\nVersion 1 (Large jpg 1.2MB)  \n [http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout16.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823182158/http:/www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout16.jpg)\n\nVersion 2 (Earlier version, a few changes, large jpg)  \n [http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout15.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823182158/http:/www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout15.jpg)\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\nJamis\n\n",

      "content": "I'd say spell out \"small to medium\" instead of \"small-medium\". Also, that swash on 'You' does nothing but break up the sentence. Get rid of it.\n\nWhy is the word \"DESIGNED\" in small caps under the pictures? It doesn't stand out enough to be a link, and it stands out too much to be just normal text.\n\nGo with the brown \"Website Design\" at the top right of each picture instead of the orange.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

      "content": "@Lex: Thanks for the feedback. I agree with all of your comments. I've made those changes.  \nI removed the swash from then end of \"you\" but added one at the beginning. Let me know if you like it.\n\nIn response to your question: \"Why is the word “DESIGNED” in small caps under the pictures? It doesn’t stand out enough to be a link, and it stands out too much to be just normal text.\"\n\nAnswer: I wanted highlight what I had done on those projects without having to make bullet points. So I used small caps to make emphasis to those. Do you think this treatment is not accomplishing that effectively?\n\nI've made the changes and re-uploaded the file.  \n [http://www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout16.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823182158/http:/www.jamischarles.com/dev/layout16.jpg)\n\nThanks,\n\nJamis\n\n"

      "content": "I think it's looking better now.\n\nThe small caps in the middle of a sentence like that just doesn't work, at least for a website. Maybe try italics instead, but I really don't think any emphasis is necessary.\n\nAlso, I assume you'll edit your real copy so that every other sentence doesn't begin with \"also\".\n\n- Lex\n\n"
