      "content": "Behrens Antiqua was a Klngspor type.  \nSo it might be possible, that Schriften-Service Gerstenberg, the follow-up of D. Stempel in Frankfurt, Germany, still holds the matrizes. Its not in the current program. This means, officially its only possible to order 6 times 1/2 minimum. So if you would order a, lets say, 28 p (best choice to produce clean prints from) 1/2 minimum’s weight is at about 8 kg. 1 kg = 65 Euro. 8 x 520 Euro. 6 times 1/2 kg ... lot of money. :( - may be, its possible to order just 3 times 1/2 minimum... I don’t know yet.\n\nIf you are interested you can go directly into contact:  \n [http://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/kontakt.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103071531/http:/www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/kontakt.htm \"http://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/kontakt.htm\")\n\nOr, easier,discuss it with me by email.
