Like why was the cap U (the one that looks like a big Latin lc \"y\") left/made into a form different than the Latin cap \"Y\"\\*, while something like the EM was made totally Latin? Was there some system to it?   \n   \n\\* BTW, wassup with the code point 04AE in Unicode?   \n   \nhhp\n\n",

      "content": "Have you read Vladimir Yefimov's essay on the Petrine Civil Type in _Language Culture Type_? It doesn't directly address the capital U question, but it does provide a fairly detailed history of the reform. Of course, at the final stage Peter the Great simply picked up a pen and crossed out a pile of stuff: alphabet reform by royal fiat, and I don't suppose the Tsar felt any need to explain himself.   \n   \nYou might also track down volumes 3:4 (1969) and 4:2 (1970) of the journal _Visible Language_, which contain a two-part essay on 'The Genesis of Russian Grazhdanskii Shrift or Civil Type' by Ivan L. Kaldor. I don't have my copies to hand, so I can't check what information they might include about the alphabet reform. Kaldor was principally interested in identifying the specific Latin types on which the Civil Type was based.   \n   \n_BTW, wassup with the code point 04AE in Unicode?_   \n   \nIt's used in the Cyrillic orthographies of Azerbaijani, Bashkir and Kalmyk. Take a look at the lowercase form, U+04AF. I'm not sure when this developed. All three languages were written in variants of the Latin script in the 1920s and 1930s, until Stalin decided that the USSR should be a Cyrillic-only zone. But if you take a look at the images at [this site](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123310/http:/www.pmicro.kz/~library/unicode/index.html), taken from M.I. Isaev's _Yazykovoe strointel'stvo v SSSR_, you'll see that the 'Y' is shown with a typical Russian U form. It is difficult to tell whether this represents the form used for these languages in the 1920s and 1930s or if this was simply what Isaev had available in 1979.\n\n"

In fact I can make it second in line (after part 3 of that Ovink thing), not least because Typophile threads get \"closed\" after a month of inactivity...   \n   \nAnd thanks for the VL references. I recently finished \"mining\" Quaerendo all the way back to the beginning, and VL/JoTR can be next. Long live UCLA! Well, at least their libraries...   \n   \n\\> at the final stage Peter the Great simply picked up a pen and crossed out a pile of stuff   \n   \nThat's what I suspected. But I guess the preparatory stuff by \"advisors\" did guide the process to a large extent (at least I hope so). Nonetheless, what might be called the erratic, \"human\" nature of the process probably resulted in some strangeness. For example, for the cap U, I wonder if Peter saw a lc Latin \"y\", and since it's \"tall\" he thought it was a cap, and he just took a fancy to it? But this is mostly just my imagination for now - I'll read up that material soon.   \n   \n\\>\\> 04AE   \n\\> Take a look at the lowercase form   \n   \nHuh, it looks like a van Krimpen Greek gamma.   \n   \n\\> All three languages were written in variants of the Latin script in the 1920s and 1930s   \n   \nIt seems that this is what would have made them used a more Latin form, although   \nthat lc is still strange - maybe it was to differentiate it from the mainstream/Russian form.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

All three languages use this straight-leg form _and_ the typical Cyrillic U. In the new Azerbaijani Latin orthography (1992), the latter is written _u_ while the straight-leg letter is written as _ü_. I'm not sure of the exact phonetic value.\n\n"

      "content": "Further, regarding the Azerbaijani orthography:   \n   \nWhen written in the Arabic script, Azerbaijani uses letters as vowels, not Arabic vocalisation marks (like the Yiddish and Ladino use of the Hebrew script). The close vowels discussed above, _u_ and _ü_, as well as the vowels _o_ and _�_ are all written using the Arabic letter _waw_ which may be optionally distinguished by the addition of superscript marks:   \n   \no = _waw_ with _sukun_   \n� = _waw_ with _hamza_   \nu = _waw_ with _damma_   \nü = _waw_ with _hamza_   \n   \nObviously the distinction between the quality of the vowel sound is considered more important than the actual position of the sound, since both the _�_ and _ü_ are written the same way in the Azerbaijani Arabic orthography.\n\n"
