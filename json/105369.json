      "content": "This is a proprietary variation of Fette Gotisch designed by Friedrich Wilhelm Bauer between 1860 and 1875. Versions of Fette Gotisch with highlighting similar to the Detroit Free Press, to suggest raised letters, were adopted by many newspapers for their logo.  \nFette Gotisch, with minor variations, is available from [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317143559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fette-gotisch/), [URW+++, Elsner + Flake, and Scangraphic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317143559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fette-gotisch/alternate_cuts.html), and [Mecanorma](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317143559/http:/www.identifont.com/show?DWU).  \nThe Detroit Free Press logo was created many years ago. I doubt that it was ever expanded to serve as a font.  \nIn the late 19th century foundries sold highlighted blackletter type that was somewhat similar to this logo, but I have not seen an exact match.  \nDon\n\n"
