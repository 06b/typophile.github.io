Thank you both for the reply!\n\nYes the Hubert Jocham Double U Serif looks to be a match.\n\nAlthough the \"e\" doesn't seem to slant up and the dot of the \"i\" looks higher up. Those details may be custom to the headline. I'm calling it mystery solved.\n\nMany thanks again. I love the Typophile folks.\n\nJC\n\n"
