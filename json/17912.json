I'm wondering how to create an Illustrator file with editable text that one could use to demonstrate it. Could you edit the font name in a file, so that it always substituted??\n\nRichard\n\nEDIT: fixed the image Mark. I just tried editing the font name (using a text editor) in a simple EPS file to something gibberish, but it syill opened without substitution in Illustrator :(\n\n"

The loose spacing indicates that it was artificially boldened like on the website.\n\nRegarding the Galliard oddities, not all cuts of Galliard are identical. The Bitstream version has a slightly more slanted A than the Linotype/Adobe version, not as slanted as this though. FYI, the Bitstream version is more \"true\" since Carter supervised its digitization. The spacing in the italics in the Linotype/Adobe version is not so good.\n\n"
