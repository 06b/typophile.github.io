Sneaky is a connecting-script and sibling of his popular “Pooper Black” type, which shares a similar flow and casual elegance. It features shared details and relative size so that with careful design, the two can be mixed and matched. Sneaky Pro features over 500 glyphs with alternates and a Central European character set.\n\nThe font is available in regular TT/PS/OT formats for only  \n$19.95 or in Pro OpenType format for $29.95 (that’s less than 6 cents per glyph!).  \n [http://www.p22.com/ihof/sneakypro.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080516072814/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/sneakypro.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/sneakypro.html\")\n\nP22 type foundry  \n [http://www.p22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080516072814/http:/www.p22.com/ \"http://www.p22.com\")\n\n",
