  "content": "So I’ve decided to make the effort and actually keep up to date on the latest in design and that means picking up the pieces of my long lost relationship with Type. We had it good back in the day but we both grew successful, didn’t have time for one another and then eventually drifted apart. But I’ve decided no more games. I’m back. And this time, it is for real.\n\nI love you Type. You are all that is pretty and perfect.\n\nForever,  \nzeena\n\nPS - To further prove my pining for you, I’ve attached a token of my affection.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [zeena plus type equals love.doc](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122024706/http:/typophile.com/files/zeena%20plus%20type%20equals%20love.doc) | 25 KB |\n\n",

Therefore no .gif available at this time since i can only create the .gif from a .ppt file and as you might know, this looks atrocious and does not do the typeface justice. believe me, this is tragic for the both of us! you can also view the font here:\n\n[http://www.showstudio.com/archive/title/p](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122024706/http:/www.showstudio.com/archive/title/p \"http://www.showstudio.com/archive/title/p\")\n\ncredit to nick night.\n\nthe typeface is listed under pagan poetry, which is what nick created (inspired by the video he made for bjork for the song with the same name)\n\n"
