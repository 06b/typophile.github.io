  "content": "Hi everybody\n\nI will use this font only to set my buisness card etc. Thats why I just made the letters I need for my name and my address. I am a bit lazy at the moment :D  \nCapitals, numerals, &, @ and a few italic letters to set the URL will follow later\n\nFirst I made some sketches and tried to experiment a bit. It was hard for me to find the right direction in which I wanted to go. After a while I had the idea to make something like a \"light, low contrast, brush drawn, transitional\"!??! Sounds a bit weird. Thats why I named this stuff after the greek goddess of strife [Eris](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123231718/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris). After a few test I normalized the letters a bit to make them readable.\n\nI dont know if the font works? I hope you like what I have done so far. Do you think it will work for small texts or how could I improve it!? Or is this a totally wrong direction that i took? Its the first time that I try to make a \"textface\".\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n[Working 001.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123231718/http:/lastraw.de/Steven/Working%20001.pdf).\n\nBye: Steven\n\n",

      "content": "I like it a lot. It has a classical elegance with some nice subtle contemporary (transitional?) qualities.\n\nNow for the critique bit...\n\nI think the bent stems on the d, m, n, r and u add an inappropriate quirky element that i'm not liking too much.\n\nMaybe lose the skews on both axis on the i dot, and there's a few flat spots that could do with some rounding off, like the tail of the a and g, and the top of the f.\n\nI'm not sure about the end of the arm? (sorry, not up to scratch on my type anatomy) on the r. It seems a bit vague.\n\nI'm certainly no expert on serif text fonts but maybe the bowls of the a, e and g need to be a little bigger for clarity at small print sizes.\n\nBut if you change everything i've mentioned it may lose all the qualities you were aiming for.\n\nAnyway, i could see it becoming a very nice and useful font.\n\nNow show us your x ;)\n\n"

Otherwise the style that I actually wanted to get will get lost. Exactly like you said.  \nI tried to make a x but I failed :) I will show it later to you. Sunday I will go on vacancy for a week. After that I will work again on it :)\n\nAnd  \nDear Mr. Pitoyo :)  \nKerning is a think that I have never done before. This is the part where I really need some help. Until now the kerning is just improved. But I first want to finish the letters before I do the kerning.  \nSometimes the face reminds me on Baskerville too. Mainly in small sizes. I think thats because of the loop of the g. I think I will close the loop.\n\nThank you again and please keep commenting this thread. I will be back in a week :D\n\nBye: Steven\n\n"

      "content": "By to by, I also agree with Mr. Greenslade about how your face has a lot of quirkiness. However, this can really turn to your advantage because you can make _two_ versions of it. One for titling, one for text. The former will have tighter spacing, higher x-height, more delicate strokes and so on; and the latter will be 'regularized' for text -- maybe buff the strokes a little bit, too :)\n\n"

      "content": "I don't know how to improve them for text and keep them looking good in display sizes!? I really like the extreme round part close before the shoulder and would like to keep it. It looks a bit italic and more brush drawn!? But i think this part have to make it softer to make the letters more readable. To make 2 versions would help. I could make a softer \"shoulder\" for textsizes and a rounder for display!? But I think that they will differ to much from each other then!? Or how should I do it!?\n\n"
