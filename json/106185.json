  "content": "We work with packaging for many countries and has to deal with many languages, many we don't read and with alphabets we don't recognize. To control this we use software to control that the unicode values are the same in input (text in Word documents) and output (pdf generated from QuarkXpress) We are now struggling with differences in input & output for accented characters in Vietnamese text. So I wonder if the accented characters in Word can be the input (the characters you type) and not the result (the accented character)  \nOr is there an other explanation of the different unicode values for the same character? (the visual character is correct, this is verified by vietnamese)\n\n",
