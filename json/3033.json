Several of the specialty   \nfont link pages contain the listing you seek.   \n   \nScroll down to the Dover Press entry on [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20110526211112/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/fraktur.html), for example. The listing is   \nfor the books with CDs of 24 fonts only. Unfortunately, you won't find Nymphic   \nlisted. I would think that Nymphic ('tis a beauty, eh?) would appear in one of   \nthose 100 Fonts books of theirs, especially the [Victorian](http://web.archive.org/web/20110526211112/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0486233022/qid=1076344340/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-1448097-5990211?v=glance&s=books) one.   \n   \nBTW, I'm the one who exchanged posts with you on MyFonts and via e-mail   \nabout Nymphic awhile ago. I'm waiting patiently for your digitization! Perhaps   \nSolotype will beat you to it, though, now that Mr Solo is [releasing fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20110526211112/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/solotype/?itemsperpage=29&resultcount=29&page=1&mode=alpha) on   \nMyFonts.\n\n"

So I've been looking for someone who has an original specimen book that could scan it for me or something, so that one's on the back burner a bit. anyhow i'll keep you posted.\n\n"
