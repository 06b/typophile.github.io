Disturbance, while not in the style of any traditional Latin uncial script, follows the same pattern of ascending and descending letters.

[http://lanstontype.com/GiampaWonders.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006091436/http:/lanstontype.com/GiampaWonders.html)   \n [http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006091436/http:/lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html)   \n   \nJust for the record. I do not agree with Bradbury's concept of one alphabet. I designed Bodoni 26 for commercial purposes. In that regard it has served the Lanston Type Company very well. Personally I find the Finnish transitional type designs of far more interest than \"grinding Bradbury's axe\".   \n   \nI predict Finnish transitional types would be commercially doomed.   \n   \nAlthough Bodoni 26 is a great success it my speculation that it's popularity is because of its' utility and novelty, not for a profound sympathy towards the politics. As Nick would say, \"it is a happy accident\".\n\n"

      "content": "Do you mean didn't uncial precede unicase? As terms, yes, but since uncial lettering has a single case that includes forms that relate to both preceding majuscule and later miniscule forms, I'm wondering if it would be considered a subset of a more general classification of unicase alphabets, which also includes other single-case, non-uncial designs. Or is there some significant difference between uncial and unicase. For example, would anyone consider deliberate intent, i.e. rejection of bicameral norms, as a fundamental criterion for unicase? If so, that would limit the unicase category to designs that historically follow the establishment of the bicameral alphabet as the normal way of writing the Latin script.\n\n"
