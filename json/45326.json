  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m looking for a font which looks like the one used on the poster of “Before The Devil Knows You’re Dead”. It should contain the polygonal shape (no curves) and the unregular align of letters.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906125131im_/http:/typophile.com/files/beforeDevil_6132.jpg)\n\nThanks a lot and sorry for my bad english.\n\n [‹ Font ID Please?
