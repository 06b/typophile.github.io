      "content": "Welcome Alex! I like how clean it looks, the rounded corners, and the pattern in a corner. I don't think the all-lowercase sans works with the company name. My suggestion is to try some different combinations with the text--All caps name, small caps tagline, title case tagline, etc. The tagline also seems too small for the title...maybe a larger size in a condensed font? The L looks heavier than the other letters. Hope that helps :)\n\nEron\n\n"
