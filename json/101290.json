  "content": "Hey there!\n\nI'm a new and learning designer just taking my first typography class. It is something I am really enjoying.  \nAs part of my class, I was assigned a typeface to study and do research on and present as my final project. The face I was given is \"Filosophia.\" It is a beautiful one and I know it was developed by Zuzana Licko of Emigre Fonts in the 1990's. I also know that it was inspired by the classic \"Bodoni.\" Outside of that, I have found very little information on Filosphia itself.\n\nDoes anyone know of any books that include information about it or its history? Are there any groups, or communities dedicated to Filosophia? How about any valid websites?\n\nThanks for the help!\n\n",

(BTW, I happen to have a letter-to-the editor about the font in a subsequent issue, but I forget the issue number, and it's too deep in the garage to bother looking for. :-)\n\nOne thing I've heard about Filosofia (correct spelling) is that Licko offered it to some large OEM font supplier (it was either Bitstream or Monotype) for inclusion in a future version of Windows, but was turned down. But that could just be a rumor, so you'd need to do the research... and hope the right people tell you the truth. Maybe now that Licko is retired from type design (?) such details -or denials- will flow more freely.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Just possibly it is a confusion arising from Filosofia being the basis for asking Microsoft to register the ['Unicase Forms'](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817080417/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_uz.htm#unic) OpenType Layout feature. That was accepted, of course, but support for the feature in apps has not followed (it will be available for webfonts with CSS3 though).\n\n"

Implementation lag has been a perennial complaint for a lot of OpenType Layout features for the past 15 years. In the case of a feature like {unic} though, support is less likely than most because, in a traditional desktop word processing or page layout app it is the sort of thing that needs UI real estate, but there are, what, two typeface families that use it?\n\n"
