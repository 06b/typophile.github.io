  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nCan someone please point me towards typefaces imitating (or close-ish to) those found in the 19th Century - particularly those of France (and Europe).\n\nI'm looking for serif typefaces than can be used for body text and headings, not script fonts. H&FJ have a couple of nice ones, but I would like to look around before deciding what to purchase.\n\nAbsolute accuracy to period is not vital - just something approximating it...\n\nMany thanks,\n\nMartin\n\n",
