  "content": "I hate designing things for myself. I find it impossible as I'm far to close to the project. So while I plan to redesign my site and marketing materials, I've decided to give my logo another shot.\n\nI went to the book store and flipped through some logo books for about 5 hours yesterday and then came home and sketched out some quick ideas on paper playing with the L and D in my companies name. The enclosures themselves I'll worry about latter, but for now I want to get opinions on the basics of the mark.\n\nI used a few different typefaces to create these comps, Helvetica, Futura, Interstate, ect.\n\nI'm not looking for something flashy in itself. But something that can be used in a variety of ways, in obtrusively on client work, distinctive on presentations and marketing material of my own. So something like this I think could be used with a few different background lockups to either emphasize or subdue it as it's so simple.\n\nBut maybe it's too simple and will be easily confused with other things?\n\n",

What's that about?\n\nMy sense is that confidence can be shown in any of a wide variety of ways. The path chosen is not just confident. It's also a bit macho. The pinwheels work against that.

But I want to urge you again to think about your intended communication to clients. There are good counter arguments, but think there are far more validating ones. Here are two: the more you are certain of your intent the more you are inspired by it to think of options that fit; but more importantly a sense of intent saves time because it makes it easy to kill the many many ideas that are outside your intent.\n\n\\* Maybe I am making a mistake here but that's how it seems.\n\nKeep going.\n\n"
