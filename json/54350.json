Yea, they reckon it's hand-drawn.  \nIt's like a in-between Futura and Mostra 2 (Straight Letter \"G\").\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark\\_simonson/mostra/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821050300/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/mostra/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark\\_simonson/mostra/\")\n\nBtw, thanks for the reply guys...\n\n"
