  "content": "Hi All,\n\nWe're doing an illustrated book of yoga exercises which will have more photos than type. A previous book in the genre used Stone Informal but they want to replace that with something else that's different but the same, the usual story.\n\nSo I think I'm looking for something that might be somewhere between a serif and a sans or perhaps a particularly lively sans font that's not one of the usual suspects.\n\nAny thoughts/directions/suggestions gratefully accepted.\n\nJohn\n\n",
