  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI am looking for a corporate typeface for a company about to enter the mobile phone service market and was wondering if anyone had any ideas.\n\nHere are some further details:\n\n**Audience**  \nworking professionals, core being around 25-50\n\n**Message**  \nAll aspects of the financial sector (traditional, secure, etc.) BUT ALSO sophisticated/clever, inventive, stylish\n\n**Media**  \nMainly web-based (then only as display font), although there will be print advertising plus annual reports, etc. (then, of course, both as display and text font)\n\n**Special requirements**  \nThe font should have an extensive special character set to work with most Latin character languages; if possible, the font should retain its characteristics/legibility in extremely small sizes (mobile phone screen), but also extremely large sizes (billboard advertising)\n\n**First ideas**  \nI am generally looking more in the sans serif direction; the font should be clean and legible, while keeping some small quirky elements/attention to detail.  \nI have already looked at [Malmö Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043633/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=malm%C3%B6&site=d&btnG=Go) (love the Headline version), [Reykjavik](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043633/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=reykjavik&x=0&y=0) (added bonus of male/female versions).\n\nIt would be brilliant if anyone has any ideas in that direction!\n\nMany thanks, Max\n\n",
