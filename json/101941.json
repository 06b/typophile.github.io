  "content": "I want to create a typeface (OTF) based upon the handwriting of my Grandmother. She has beautiful handwriting. What I am wondering is if there is some resource out there outlining a list of particular words or a paragraph, that I should have her write in order to understand the relationship between specific letters (i.e. ss, th, tt, ing, etc.). My thought is that there may be a paragraph (or more) of text that she can write down and that I can study in order to learn and create the typeface. Any insight on how I might go about starting this would be great! Thanks!\n\n",
