As a parttime (and slacking) reporter of type news I know from firsthand experience that keeping the momentum going is a feat, let alone for ten years straight. My hat is off to Simon for his dedication. I am very impressed indeed.\n\n [‹ Where on earth are you creating your fonts? { Google Earth location }](http://web.archive.org/web/20071214200213/http:/typophile.com/node/18249 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lettering Exhibition, Traveling ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071214200213/http:/typophile.com/node/18293 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
