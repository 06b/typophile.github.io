Whenever I try to use this utility, system brings up Windows Installer with an error message that says:  \n\"Windows Installer is looking for, but can't find:  \nMicrosoft Opentype Font File Properties Extension.msi\"\n\n... and gives a browse function for this installer file.\n\nThis utility works fine if I select the \"cancel\" button on Installer window, however.\n\nI've tried removing this utility to reinstall it, but I get the same error message. Could anyone shed some light on what the problem could be?\n\nAlso, will this utility run under Windows 7 Pro x64?\n\n",
