His [Qwigley](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415203813/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/qwigley-rob/) is somewhat like your sample.

Look how similar the lettering looks in [Pronto](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415203813/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/pronto/).There are others that are also very similar, just not this exact font (yet), in what I have seen.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
