The idea is based on different elements like corners which I can copy/paiste and hereby quickly create a new type-expression. The basic idea is inspired by things created in the Bauhaus periods and other who work systematic and so on...\n\nI’m curious to hear what other typedesigners have of comments and if there is anything I should look into - while doing this type, that could help me in skipping steps (due to I’m new in typedesigning).\n\nHope to from all of you designere.\n\nHave great day.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417042607im_/http:/typophile.com/files/O_5268.jpg)\n\n",
