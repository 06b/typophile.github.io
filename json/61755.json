  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am interested to know if anyone can identify this typeface? It should be quite easy, I just cannot seem to find it online anywhere. I'm sure this will be an easy one…\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009102736im_/http:/typophile.com/files/iso50-g-giveaway-101_4174.jpg)\n\nAlso, I've not used extended fonts ever, and wondered what are a few good ones to use? More importantly, are there any good ones stored away in my default typefaces somewhere (I'm a Mac user with CS3). Any help you could give would be very much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nNat\n\n",
