Instead of saying merely ' **lose the drop shadow ... definitely**', you might have offered to say _why_ you made this suggestion, rather than expect compliance uncomprehendingly.\n\nI opened _this_ thread hoping to get away from that sort of comment.\n\n"

It's your work, I offered a suggestion, I don't think the drop shadow adds any use to the \"logo.\"\n\nYou posted this in the Logo critique section, so I was commenting on the 'logo' on the site. But the problems run much deeper. The 'type' used feels rigid, as does the structure of the information, it's all very tight and confusing in its structure.\n\nWhat's the site about, what's the meaning of tepid air in relation to the site, why the colour choice, who is your audience, what are you trying to communicate?\n\n... perhaps your approach is wrong.\n\n----------  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Brand Design Melbourne](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020201212/http:/www.solid-creative.com/)\n\n"

I take your point about the purpose of the site being identified rather vaguely, and have made a change to the brief description in the header.\n\nAs for the 'structure' of the site, as you will have seen, it _is_ organised logically, and with navigation obvious, despite your comment here that it is '_confusing_'. The structure of the individual pages are, likewise, logical and with extra navigation as necessary.\n\nIt is possible much of your objections arise through visiting the site under a Windows OS. Of this I am aware and, because this is a personal site, I am not particularly concerned to create a site which is rendered more-or-less similar under several OSs.\n\n"

And you'll find that purist type aficionados will usually be against it because it presents the letters with unintended baggage.\n\nPersonally, I'd take it off, and make the med. gray one shade darker to compensate.\n\n"

Here, nothing has been changed, just the shadow removed.\n\nI have tried using a slightly darker grey, but I feel the shadow gives both colours a better degree of separation from the background without resorting to 'reflections', while still allowing lighter colours.\n\nI hear what you say about _unintended baggage_ and '_fashion'_, but I don't pretend to be in the vanguard; I'm still struggling to catch up with the rearguard!\n\n"
