We often overlook some great examples of typography as we go about our daily lives. FOUND focuses in on those subtle examples as well as dramatic ones, such as signs and graffiti. For the first edition of FOUND I have focused in on Springfield, OH and all of the forgotten type that it holds. Next up Seattle, WA.\n\nPreview and pick up your copy at [http://www.lulu.com/content/379191](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014223327/http:/www.lulu.com/content/379191 \"http://www.lulu.com/content/379191\").\n\nThanks\n\n-- Andy\n\n",

      "content": "I'm a resident of Springfield. It's an old industrial town and has a huge amount of leftover signage and what not from that time frame. A good slice of a common midwest industrial town. The history in the book is pulled from Wikepedia and has a lot of interesting tidbits. My favorite is that the first official jail was guarded by a black bear.\n\nSeattle is my next book. Should be cool.\n\nI also want to do one on old sheet music typographic illustrations. Some nice stuff there.\n\n--ah\n\n"
