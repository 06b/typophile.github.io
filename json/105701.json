      "content": "My [Sensibility](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418154808/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sensibility/) is very compact humanist sans, with eight weights, so would give you a lot of design ﬂexibility. Its partner [Sense](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418154808/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sense/) is plainer, but also with the marked overshoot of ascender over cap that would harmonize with Tribute.\n\nMy [Brown](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418154808/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/brown/) is more straightforward and also semi-condensed, and its detailing gives it a slightly old school/letterpress quality to match Tribute.\n\nStorm’s [Sebastian](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418154808/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/sebastian-pro/) has classic old style proportions, as do Mr Eaves and Brandon Grotesque with their small x-height.\n\n"
