It’s a subtle change (at least in the condensed weight!), but I think it works. Here are two before-and-after comparisons.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829165002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/beforeafter_samp2_4110.gif)\n\nIn making the “spurs” narrower, I was forced to open up some of the counters... I don’t think the difference is negligible (see sample below), but FontStruct has certain limitations.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829165002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/beforeafter_samp1_3523.gif)\n\n"
