I have been using simple plain white paper or standard lined pages for years now and I think it’s time for a change. Is there any particular style of notebook or grid system common to type design notebooks? Or are their specific types of notebooks for type design? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n [‹ Help!

[My all time favourite](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011063023/http:/ramcg.blogspot.com/2005/08/fabriano-classic-artists-journal.html) was chosen for me though.\n\n(Tina - your links aren’t working)\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

So at the moment my favorite is from [Muji](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011063023/http:/www.mujionline.co.uk/) (there is a search form, but you can search the stationary section as well): the **EVA Zipper Double Ringnote**. It is available in A5 and A6. There are superfine dots on the paper which don’t distract and the surface is very smooth and a joy to write on. But even better is the integrated semi-opaque plastic zipper bag on the front. Here you can store snippets with notes and even a pencil or whatever use- or playful you fancy. Although I’d wish they’d offer more sizes some day, the A5 is fine to always have in the bag.\n\n"
