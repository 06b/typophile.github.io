  "content": "A fresh new decorative display face bubbling with life & spontaneity,  \nJabberwub belongs to a rare genus of creature fonts that type  \nforgot—casual animated. A fun & bouncy eye-catcher dancing a whacky  \nline between discord & rhyme, Jabberwub packs tons of fun into a  \nstate-of-the-art OpenType font loaded with 270 extra glyphs, including  \nstylistic alternates, discretionary ligatures, word ligatures and  \ncapitalized ligatures, allowing creative typographers to achieve a  \ncustom hand-lettered look without all the mess & spilt glue of a  \nmanual paste-up job.\n\nJabberwub is ideal for whatever zany stuff springs to mind. It takes  \nan outline with no problem-o, and you can squish & squoosh it as the  \noccasion takes your fancy. Optimal results are achieved by hand  \nsetting each individual glyph. Available in OpenType only.\n\nJabberwub can be viewed and test driven now at Myfonts:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/jabberwub/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140821033013/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/jabberwub/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/jabberwub/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140821033013im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3050010872_dc589a558a_3501.jpg)\n\n",
