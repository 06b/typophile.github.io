This is kind of like the previous posts about found type photos I have done (see the links at the bottom of the post), but from now on I will try to write a little about each picture instead of just posting them.\n\nTo see the rest of the images, and read my thoughts on them, please visit the post on my personal blog:\n\n[Typography Photography Vol. 3, 10 more great photos of found type](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615125752/http:/gentlepurespace.com/blog/archives/typography-photography-3)\n\nPrevious versions: [Vol 2](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615125752/http:/gentlepurespace.com/blog/archives/five-found-type-photos-2) | [Vol 1](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615125752/http:/gentlepurespace.com/blog/archives/five-found-type-photos)\n\n",
