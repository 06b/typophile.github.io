Nope, I won’t be there to see the kickoff, but on Tuesday, we’re rockin’ at Fenway Park.\n\nLooks like [Cooper Black](http://web.archive.org/web/20060507170312/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/cooper-black/ef-bold/testdrive.html?s=Rolling+Stones&p=36) takes front and center at the Stones’ [**_A Bigger Bang_**](http://web.archive.org/web/20060507170312/http:/www.rollingstones.com/abiggerbang/) media center.\n\nOddly enough, it looks like [Bodoni Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20060507170312/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bodoni/roman/testdrive.html?s=A+Bigger+Bang&p=48) is being used on the video title… hairlines dropping away… just like the Stones themselves!\n\n—————————————————————  \nYes, I’m old, but I still ROCK!\n\n",
