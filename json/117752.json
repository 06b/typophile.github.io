      "content": "Good digging Kevin. I found no matches for the odd combination of an asymmetrical round top \\_A\\_ and squared \\_U\\_ with box interior. I knew the curve on the Hyundai \\_A\\_ was too boxy, but since I missed the matching \\_A\\_ in Rusty, I used Hyundai's \\_A\\_ to poke the discussion forward.  \nI was hoping someone would find some options for the the capital letters beyond ALUMA. Your collection is indeed helpful for making the decisions that needed to produce these \"squaring the circle\" letters. One possibility is to use Purista Bold as the default for letter proportions and adjust with ideas from other fonts: including widening the \\_M\\_ so that it would be somewhere between the width in Purista and Pluto; using the \\_A\\_ in Rusty; and perhaps the S from Pluto.  \nPerhaps ALUMA would be less conflicted and have more impact if the \\_U\\_ was a flipped \\_A\\_ without the crossbar. Which raises the possibility of making \\_N\\_ using a mirrored \\_A\\_ without the crossbar. And so forth.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "As for the last part about flipping and mirroring \\_A\\_ to make other letters, I know that they would end up looking somewhat similar to several letters in the lowercase of Handel Gothic. It's probably not a good idea to flood this alphabet with various other letterforms from Handel Gothic. The Hyundai logo reads well, in my opinion because the Handel Gothic style \\_A\\_, \\_U\\_ and \\_N\\_ are contrasted with a standard \\_Y\\_.  \nMight be interesting to make a modified ALUMA into a font.  \nDon\n\n"
