The only people who use it on a regular basis are [11 Freunde magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20110108060642/http:/www.11freunde.de/) and, for a couple of weeks now, the [Universalmuseum Joanneum](http://web.archive.org/web/20110108060642/http:/www.museum-joanneum.at/) in Graz.\n\nI'm currently working on the final version (I'm on it right now actually), which will just be called \"Tram\". It will have seven weights, possibly also corresponding italics, and yes, it WILL be released, as soon as possible ;-)\n\nI'll keep you updated...\n\nCheers,  \nHanno\n\nPS: Here's a preview (a couple of months old now, but all the new weights are in there, as well as an unfinished italic):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110108060642im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tram2009_5465.jpg)\n\n"

I guess he found the typeface in \"11 Freunde\".  \n(I’ll ask him.)\n\nHanno, beautiful work! For me Tramway combines the clearness of FF Unit with the squareness of – let me say – Cachet (I hope you like it when I put it this way). Let me know when it is going to be released. It’s a case for Fontshop!\n\nBye for now!  \nQuadrato\n\n"
