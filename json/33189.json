  "content": "I recently designed a business proposal for a company as part of some freelance. They gave me all of the copy to use, but they customize their proposals to tailor to the specific client, so they need to be edited for each new proposal. The problem is, I designed the proposals in InDesign, and the company wants to be able to edit the proposals on their own (when they're on the road, etc.).\n\nThey don't own a license of InDesign, and buying copies for each person would probably be overkill since all they would use it for would be to edit these proposals. They want me to migrate my design to Word so they can edit it, but I don't have much experience with Word templates, and I feel it would be a lot of work with the way the spreads are laid out.\n\nIs there a better option for converting an InDesign document design to something that common, everyday users can edit?\n\n",
