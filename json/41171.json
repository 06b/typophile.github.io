  "content": "Hey there,\n\nI hope you can help me out. I’m looking for the font which is used in the attached sample. I think it’s a <cite>Rotis Sans</cite> however the ampersand does not match the <cite>Rotis Sans</cite> ampersand i know. Maybe a different ampersand is used, maybe it’s not a <cite>Rotis Sans</cite> at all. Voices in my head say that <cite>Lucas de Groot</cite> is somehow involved, however I cannot find anything <cite>LucasFonts-related</cite>. Any help is appreciated!\n\nCheers,  \nPaul\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [rotiswannabe.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330183424/http:/typophile.com/files/rotiswannabe.jpg) | 7.33 KB |\n\n [‹ Help ID this script font - handwash label](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330183424/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41178 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Name of these nike fonts ? ? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330183424/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41099 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
