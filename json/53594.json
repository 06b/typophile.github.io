  "content": "At work I'M supposed to design a website for Technique. Technique offers you hair products, so the design should be represent this kind of beauty care.\n\nHere is my first attempt:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725205039im_/http:/typophile.com/files/honlapterv_01_3847.jpg)\n\nThat's just the headline. I'd like to use that specific design of the offical logo on the whole website. But I really have a difficult situation here. I like the girl with the red hair, but she doesn't fill the whole space. Resizing her won't solve the problem, because this size fits the best on the headline. And looks the best of course.\n\nSo, I keep thinking about what to use to fill that space on her left side.  \nSome ideas? Please share!\n\n",

But I kind of feel it's unfinished.\n\nThe structure of the site is already finished, so I don't need to design those parts anymore. My only problem left is the headline, and to be more specific, that empty space on the headline.\n\nSo I'd like to get suggestions, ideas for that part of the work only. Thanks a lot! :)\n\n"

In this case the headline means the girl, the logo, and the empty, white space between the two.\n\nSo my problem is that white space. It feels kind of empty for me and I don't know what to put there.\n\nI hope I could explain it well enough. :)\n\n"
