  "content": "A co-worker of mine is getting a tattoo this week. Her name is \"Tiffany\" and she's looking to get just the world \"beautiful\" on her arm. She's really liking the absence of style that Helvetica provides. However, she'd really like to style the \"tif\" part in the word a bit different as it's part of her name.\n\nWe played around with a few ideas, such as making it light, but nothing really felt right because it sits in the middle of the word and seems to break up the consistency that Helvetica provides in the first place.\n\nAnyone have any good recommendations on how to style that part of the word different in such a way that still looks great? Or maybe any examples of signs/posters where they've done something similar that has looked great?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130901045121im_/http:/typophile.com/files/beautiful_6486.png)\n\n",
