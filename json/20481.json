  "content": "Hi All,  \nI'm after some advice on a job we're doing at the moment -  \nOur client is opening a venue with a modern-deco feel and we are trying to find a suitable typeface as their corporate font.  \nWe love Scala Sans - however for several reasons we are unable to use that exact face - can anyone suggest an alternate face? I particularly love the crossed 'W' and anything that gives a sophisticated feel would be great.\n\nMany Thanks,  \nPaul.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [WHITEWINE.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008160042/http:/typophile.com/files/WHITEWINE.jpg) | 9.12 KB |\n\n",
