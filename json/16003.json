That way you are “not” logged in as Nick, but can participate anyway.\n\nBTW I was reading the discussion re the new OTF version of ITC Avant Garde Gothic on this other site and I felt kind of \\*small\\* because the people involved were so knowledgable about the matter — even though I have been involved with type, typography and design for a quarter of a century. AND I have seen and read and appreciated all U&lc’s for ages.  \nMaybe I should set up some special \\*lurking\\* accounts to get rid of that feeling… hah!\n\n"
