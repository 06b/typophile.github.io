Matthews published 1952, a supplement to Sign Slogans and Snap Shots.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120501043345im_/http:/typophile.com/files/modernsignsbook_4826.jpg)\n\n...\n\nMatthews comments:\n\nThis elaborate piece of work was done 75 years ago and it was published in a big five dollar book \"Alphabets, Monograms, Initials, Crests, Etc.\" back in 1885. I have one of the few copies still in existence. The original drawing measured 7 3/8 x 9 inches.\n\nRipley once drew up a simplified version of it for use in his \"Believe it or Not.\" I have heard that the inventor of the linotype machine went crazy because of the very intricate work involved. But I don't know what became of this modest artist who simply signed the monogram with the initial D.\n\n...\n\nI picked up that 121 page supplement, which is full of fantastic stuffs, and a first edition The Book of 100 Type Face Alphabets by J. I. Beigeleisen, for just 5 bucks!\n\n"
