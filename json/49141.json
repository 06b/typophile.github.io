This single weight offering is modeled after the Regular weight of the primary family.\n\nWhile **Adriane Text** is intended for thoroughly classical book design, **Adriane Lux** enters the fold as an equally traditional display face. Have it foil-stamped on your next faux-leather book cover design or embossed on your personal calling card for a touch of well-behaved, regal formalism.\n\nMore about:  \n [**Typefolio**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414141555/http:/www.typefolio.com/)\n\nOur Partners:  \n [**MyFonts**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414141555/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/typefolio/)  \n [**TypeTrust**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414141555/http:/www.typetrust.com/designer/marconilima)  \n [**Veer**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414141555/http:/www.veer.com/products/browse.aspx?vendor=CTT&page=&view=browse)\n\n",
