      "content": "[ITC Founders Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20060720203817/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/founders-caslon/) is probably your best bet. I’m not sure how widespread its use would have been in Scotland mid-century, but it had already made a big impression in England and was very popular. Prior to Caslon, most British printing used fairly generic and undistinguished late renaissance types, and the use of these likely persisted in Scotland, Wales and Ireland longer than in England.\n\nI can also recommend Traquair’s [Jacobite Ale](http://web.archive.org/web/20060720203817/http:/www.traquair.co.uk/breweryales.html) to drink while you are working on this project.\n\n"
