Tell the client they’ve selected the direction and that you need one more pass to clean it up. Then swap out Rotis for just about anything that is equally light. (Rotis is dreadful, esp. Those Cs.) Then fix your line spacing and your word spacing. Bam client I’d happy and your integrity intact.\n\n"

I agree with not sending out the junk.\n\nI’ve been able to make minor improvements to the spacing issues as well as decreasing the nasty horizontal scaling. The client never noticed the changes, so I feel a little better about that.\n\nUnfortunately we’re stuck with Rotis though. I was trying to sell Triplex for a few rounds, but that was for nothing.\n\nThanks guys.\n\n"
