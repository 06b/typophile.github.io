They supplied the outline data, some of which had been around the block in other font formats for several decades, and we built TTFs and added OpenType Layout tables. Fairly typical bread-and-butter work for us. I was bemused when we received marketing feedback that the design of the asterisks in the fonts needed to be changed from six-pointed to five-pointed, for ’cultural reasons’.\n\nAdam, that slide is clearly a Zionist conspiracy. :)\n\n"
