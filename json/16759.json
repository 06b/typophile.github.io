It's more \"professional\" than Infinity, but still has the contemporary feel I think you want. It is possible that I see Apex Sans as architecty due to it's use by thirst in a series of posters for IIT's series of lectures on architecture. I stole (uh, aquisitioned?) one of them and hung it over my desk so I could gaze at it. So my vote is for Apex Sans.\n\n[small examples](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175210/http:/www.idonline.com/adr01/iit.asp)  \n [another one](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175210/http:/www.underconsideration.com/speakup/interviews/images/iit_poster.gif)\n\nIsn't it funny how we use ambiguous words like professional and contemporary and expect that we know what the other means?

The display versions are a bit weird, but the text versions might work for you.\n\nMore self-conscious but very well done is [Cholla](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175210/http:/emigre.com/EF.php?fid=84), which I saw used here in Washington DC at the Hirschhorn Gallery. Also a bit along the self-conscious line, but which I like better is [Amplitude](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175210/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude), which, like Simian is by Christian Schwartz.\n\nJeremy Tankard's [Aspect](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175210/http:/www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm) is both both architectural and avant-garde.\n\nIf you like stuff that is somehow both modern and Baroque you will go nuts over [Storm's faces](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175210/http:/www.stormtype.com/)\n\n"
