You'd just have to raise the height of the shorter vertical strokes to the x-height of the other scripts you've used already, making them barley more than a stroke's breadth shorter than the taller vertical strokes, plus some other cosmetic changes. I have no idea whether these changes would render the Arabic script illegible.\n\n"
