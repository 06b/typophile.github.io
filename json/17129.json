Nowhere is it implied that Duddy is greedy because he's jewish (I doubt Mordecai Richler, a jew himself, would be a very big anti-semite), and nowhere is Duddy's faith ever connected in any way to his character. Rather, those who claim that it's so have made the connection themselves, either through internalized racism or some other hidden prejudice.\n\nIn the same way, it is <cite>you</cite> who have made the connection between the negative portrayal of <cite>people who happen to be black</cite> and the fact that they are black, when in fact the creator probably had no such connection in mind, but rather was trying to tap into a cheesy image like the one of Curling and Canadians or Lederhosen and Austrians/Germans.\n\nIt is people like you (and I promise you that I am in no way trying to be insulting or accusative when I say this, but merely pointing out an observation) who propagate these stereotypes by insisting that any greedy person on tv or in a book who happens to also be jewish is greedy <cite>because</cite> he's jewish, or that any black person on tv or in a book who falls into some other stereotype does so <cite>because</cite> he is black.\n\n"
