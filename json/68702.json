  "content": "Hi I am currently looking for a complemental font to go with Avant Garde Gothic Pro.  \nI will be using it for kind of short length text.  \nMy problem is that AGGP Draws alot of attention to itself and I need to find a balance between the copy text and the display font (which will be AGGP)\n\nRight now I am thinking of using any of the web-safe fonts to have it a bit easier on my online portfolio.  \nBut I am not quite shure any of them serifs will do the job.\n\nBut what do you think am I stupid or do you have any suggestions?\n\n",
