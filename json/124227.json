You'll probably note she used to different sans, one is own Alexia Roux's custom typeface called 'Perception' (as seen [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123359/http:/alexiaroux.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/391.jpg)) and the one you're after which I wasn't able to positively identify.\n\nEDIT: after further inspection the second one could be [Hurme Geometric No.2](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123359/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans-2). At least I can't see any contradiction with it (/a, /0, /1, /2, /3, /5, /8, /G, /M, /L, /S...).\n\n"
