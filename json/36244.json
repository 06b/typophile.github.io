  "content": "Just thought UK typophiles might like to know about the letter carving  \nworkshops run by the Memorial Arts Charity. I completed one of the five day  \ncourses in London recently. It was well run and informative and I want  \nto support them by recommending them to anyone interested in such pursuits.\n\n[http://www.memorialartscharity.org.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014113538/http:/www.memorialartscharity.org.uk/ \"http://www.memorialartscharity.org.uk/\")\n\nI came away from the course with a new perspective and enthusiasm  \nfor letter carving, an idea for a new typeface, and some nice,  \nalbeit slightly wobbly, letters to put on the mantelpiece.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014113538im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lettercarve_3414.jpg)\n\n",
