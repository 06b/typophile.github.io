      "content": "Fulsome praise indeed James! Thank you very much. I have checked out your work - some good stuff there. I read with interest your medical problems; that sounds really terrible. Strange to think that you were so incredibly unlucky and also extremely lucky (to survive) at the same time. I am glad you can still carry on doing the work that you love.\n\nI checked out MyFonts also. Houschka is #1 today on the 'Hot new fonts' section! (and quite a lot of my other stuff is also in there) Wow. But it is just the 'normal' Houschka that I did in 1999 - so, not that new really. It was one of the first families I produced, so is not a patch on the new improved 'Pro' family.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

That makes me more flexible when it comes to peeple, and more determined to get more of my fonts finished.\n\nCongrats on Houschka reaching #1 on (what used to be named) the Starlets chart. I knew it would, and I guess it will migrate to the best sellers chart soon. If you can just get the Pro version into that position.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
