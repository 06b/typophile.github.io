      "content": "akmal cheema, I am sorry but I do not understand what \"transliteration\" means in this context. Are we looking for a font that has all the necessary English (Latin) characters and Arabic characters? Or is it a font that has phonetic symbols for Arabic pronunciation? Or something else? Can someone explain this to me?\n\nAlso, it might be helpful to offer a little bit of information about the subject of the book, so that readers can suggest an appropriate font.\n\n"
