(Looks like Casey might have some too. That was a new one for me Mark.)   \n   \nLetterhead also has one called [Ephemera](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142509/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/tomkennedy/ephemera.shtml), with swashes, but the letter style is much older and fancier-looking.\n\n"
