      "content": "I think the main point is that we seem to be in agreement that you could create this RNE lettering starting with Pompei and editing it. That means chopping off parts of serifs and cutting out part of the bowl of the R. Even adding stroke thickness, if necessary. The serifs on your E look like Pompei's E, but with some parts cut away. The fact that the N also goes below the baseline in your sample adds to the choice of Pompei as the starting point.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
