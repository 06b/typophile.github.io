The Mencken family includes various members: Text, Subhead, Head, Head Narrow, Head Compressed, Nameplates, each of them specially designed for their own function. Focus groups conducted during the redesign period liked the Mencken family; 75 percent preferred Mencken over the previous Sun typefaces. The family’s name Mencken is a tribute to H.L.
