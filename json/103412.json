  "content": "Perhaps not the right terminology but I am looking for fonts that have a big 'swashes' associated with them. I new to create something similar in the attached image, whereby the last letter, y in my case and d in the example attached forms a swash.\n\nDo such fonts exist or is this something I would manually create. Appreciate any help.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [photo.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20141011013017/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_44.JPG) | 175.61 KB |\n\n",
