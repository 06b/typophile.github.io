As the built-in Typophile search still is useless, better make yourself a browser bookmark with the following as the address:  \n`javascript:void(q=prompt('Search%20Typophile:',''));if(q)void(location.href='http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com'+'%20'+escape(q))`  \nKudos to [Grant Hutchinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706175221/http:/www.typophile.com/user/1011)!  \nIn case you don’t like Google, feel free to replace its URL with that of a competitor …\n\n2. Tools like [TextExpander](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706175221/http:/www.smileonmymac.com/textexpander/) or [Typinator](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706175221/http:/www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/) make it dead easy to quickly insert hyperlinks.\n\n"
