  "content": "I'm constantly looking out for typography magazines and think I may have found one of the best. It's called [baseline](http://web.archive.org/web/20120416001907/http:/typophile.com/wiki/baseline%20magazine) ( [http://www.baselinemagazine.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120416001907/http:/www.baselinemagazine.com/ \"http://www.baselinemagazine.com/\")) and for £48 for a quarterly magazine it beats pretty much any other I have come across so far. What I'm after are recommendations for other typesetting/typography journals/magazines. I don't actually know anyone else in person who gets the same enjoyment out of typography as I do and it's not really the sort of thing which I can talk about down at the pub with my mates! so any pointers are gratefully received!\n\n",

      "content": "I subscribed to Baseline from issues 20 to 37, and even paid a bundle for all their back issues (back to #11). Then I bought the elusive #10 on eBay. In the end though, I realized that the amount of type design (as opposed to typography, which is broader, less focused) content for the price was too low, and frankly getting lower. And realizing that my collection had become worth as much as it ever would, I sold the bundle on eBay (for a decent, not stellar price). These days I read two others: [TYPO](http://web.archive.org/web/20120416001907/http:/typophile.com/wiki/typo%20magazine), and [tipoGrafica](http://web.archive.org/web/20120416001907/http:/typophile.com/wiki/tipoGrafica). Plus the occasional \"special type issue\" of things like Eye, although I've massively cut down on my physical browsing time lately.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Contains 7 printed issues and an interactive CD-rom. Wide-ranging articles discuss typography in design, the visual arts, architecture and the environment. The first typography journal to practice what it preaches, its eight issues are a typographic journey from three-column grid to interactive CD-rom. Pre-Mac typographic experimentation at the limits of photo-typesetting, repro and print technology. Innovative, intelligent and influential. Challenging the narrow dogma of then traditional theory and commercial acceptability. Typography in Britain would never be the same again.\"\n\n[http://www.markholtdesign.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120416001907/http:/www.markholtdesign.com/ \"http://www.markholtdesign.com/\")\n\n"
