  "content": "I absolutely love the custom handlettering style from the early 60s (think [Ed Interlock](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416090914/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=150&subpage=viewfontsinuse) type of stuff) and I'd love to make a font like that of my own.. In fact, I already am making one at the moment. I found this lovely looking custom type on a movie poster from the early 60s that I'm basing my font on but I'm curious about the legalities of it, and what's considered fair and legal when you're inspired by something. The poster in question certainly didn't contain a full alphabet, so the vast majority of the letters/font is completely original work, just in the same style. That makes me think I'd be okay considering basically all of the most well-known fonts from history are basically copies of typography from antique books, and many type designers out there seem to base many of their designs on old lettering found in books and whatnot..\n\n",

      "content": "I am certain;ly not a lawyer, so take the following as just another laymen's opinion.  \nThe main crux seems to be if you draw it yourself from scratch and draw your own outlines. That does not mean a complete new design. There are a zillion Caslon and Garamond inspired faces out there. People look at specimen books and make ther own drawings legally. The big thing is the use of the name. If someone has trademarked or copyrighted the name (don't ask me which term is correct) then you can't use the name without permission. An example is, you cannot put out a face called \"Ed Interlock\" even if it looks nothing like the original.  \nI recall that Christian Schwartz did a face based on lettering he saw on industrial buildings in Pittsburgh. It sounds like your project falls in that arena.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
