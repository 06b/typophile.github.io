  "content": "Hi.\n\nSorry for the double question. Could amount to a jumbled thread.\n\nFirst: How are most of you handling a situation where you need to use a particular if you're following a client's design standards). Do most of you consider that a business expense or do you bill your client back but then you keep the font for your own use? Just a biz practice question.\n\nThe other is about license agreements. I do know they exist but I started reading some threads and was disturbed to find people questioning whether posting a pdf to a website is a violation of an agreement. I know it depends on the license but let's talk generalities.\n\nFor starters, back in the day when we didn't make pdfs for printing (I still don't unless asked) and we didn't have the option of NOT sending the font with the job to be printed, weren't we all violating license agreements? How does one get around it?  \nExpect the printer to purchase the font for every designer's job?\n\nIs the question about pds, either posted to a website or given to a client for approval, a problem because someone could extract the font (I don't see how) or is the issue that they could edit and therefore \"use\" the font?\n\nIf the latter, they can't really create anything new with it so what's the big deal? Are people really having a workflow process where the constantly password protect pdf files?\n\nI have a client who is requiring me to send my print-ready files to their client and they won't take print-ready pdfs that I know of. How do I get around this? Only use fonts that we both already have on our systems?\n\nAny input would be much appreciated.\n\n",

We were all violating the EULAS to which we had agreed when licensing the fonts. O:^o\n\nThat is the rub. If you have to give the printer the files they must have a license to the fonts. The only other work-a-round is to only license fonts from foundries that allow this. There are very, very few of these foundries.\n\nIf you have to give the client the raw files then anyone who gets the file needs to have a license for the fonts.

Do most foundries have an add-on license for a font the client already has for example.  \nOr is it usually necessary to purchase the font again for the designer.\n\nI guess I'm wondering which is cheaper. I can either purchase it myself and use it just for that client.  \nOr they can add on a license.\n\nAlso, I'm still wondering about the past (even though it's better to look to the future). Did licenses change  \nover the years? I'm still wondering how any of us ever got a job printed before the days of pdfs. Do type  \nfoundries not expect us to get jobs printed? Did they really think that commerical printers would spring  \nfor the fonts used in every designers' job?\n\nI'm not a newbie at this. But I've been breaking laws right and left for years I guess, just to get a job done.  \nIt's just that now, different things have been coming up, like having to give some clients files.  \nAnd then there's the prevalence of pdfs. I don't password protect pdfs from editing. I guess I should start.  \nBut then again, no one edits my pdfs. They're only for proofing.\n\n"

It seems crazy to ask the printer to license the font for a job, and at whose expense? Just try getting a publisher to purchase multiple licenses for one job.\n\nIf there's an honor system, the printer will delete their copy of the font after the job is done, as will the client unless they have their own license. To expect everyone who handles a file to purchase a license seems excessive and impractical. If the client plans to continue to use the font after you deliver the file they should by law purchase their own license, and so should you if you plan to go on using a font given you by a client.\n\nI didn't know the first thing about EULAs until I started hanging out at this forum and I still don't bother to read them line for line when I buy a font. I really wish the foundries would make their licenses more in line with how fonts are actually used (embedded in PDFs, sent to printers with the files) then we wouldn't all be criminals.\n\nI have one publishing client who gives me a list of fonts they already have licensed. I can only use those - fair enough since it's a good list. If I don't already have the font they'll give it to me if I sign a document promising to delete it from my hard drive when the job is completed, but I still preserve a copy of the font in the archive for the job just in case. I betcha they aren't buying additional licenses for the printer.\n\n"

There was a time when the Adobe collection was a pretty big chunk of the PostScript fonts out there. Today, many more players are in the game. A printer who had spent the bucks for the Adobe collection figured he had made his type investment. He figured there would be plenty of repeat uses of most of those faces. Now, with many thousands more possible font choices, a printer isn't so sure he will get repeats from small foundry fonts so he is less likely to purchase them and depend on the customer to supply them for his print job. Embedded pdf files seem like the solution to the printer's dilemma. The trouble comes when clients require native files.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

I see it less like the design software used to create a design, and more like royalty-free stock photography. If I license a photo for a job, and then find use for it again later, fine (assuming it's not rights managed). This is different than a PMS swatchbook. I won't bill (directly) for a swatchbook since it is a tool, like a printer, or a desk, or pencils. Those things you need to be in business. Fonts, you need for a particular job, so bill to that job.\n\nActually, I think this approach violates most EULA's less than having the client license, you use, then give to them at the end of the job (effectively a license transfer -- usually a no no). If the client also needs to use a font, we will each purchase a license.\n\nJaneP: I think that if a client requires you to use a typeface for their branding program, they either need to have a license that allows them to distribute the font to contractors, or you should bill them for the license. Attn all New Yorkers (others, google): consider if Dr. Jonathan Zizmore (board certified dermatologist) was your client. You'd be on the hook for at least 50 fonts just to modify one ad. Dr. and Mrs. Z would then, of course, salute graphic designers for their courage! I digress.\n\nRandy\n\n"
