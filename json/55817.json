If you do find yourself needing to clear system caches and reboot, don’t load the test fonts in Fex, just output them directly to ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts and restart the Adobe app to get the new fonts. If you have problems just delete the fonts, clear the application caches, and you won’t have to reboot.\n\nObviously this strategy works better on a desktop with a fast drive than on a laptop where program loading is slower.\n\n"

It doesn't matter what you call it while you're doing development testing, so I just append a revision number to the name, written out in English, and I haven't had any font conflicts that way. It also allows me to keep the earlier versions installed so I can easily make comparisons.\n\n"
