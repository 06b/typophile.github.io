  "content": "I'm creating the logo for a small interior design firm. The owner preferred initial mockups in Clearface Gothic and Officina Sans over more elegant (Bodoni, Didot, Optima, Centaur, Caslon Openface etc.) and contemporary (Gill Sans, Futura, Avenir, Helvetica, Mostra) ones.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Do you think a font like Clearface or Officina suits such a business's identity?\n\n2. What are some similar fonts I can consider?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

I suppose it depends on what sort of interior design they want to be known for. Officina is not too bad, more modern, but overused. I'd consider one of these, gentle and friendly like Clearface and Officina, but less common and more up-to-date:\n\n[Cronos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322135658/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Cronos)  \n [Bryant](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322135658/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Bryant)  \n [FF Strada](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322135658/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Strada)  \n [FF Unit](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322135658/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=FF%20Unit)\n\n"

      "content": "The disatvantage of using a well know typeface in a logotype, could be that the unique feeling get lost a bit. Even if the letters themselves are edited, the typeface itself is soemtimes so familiar that the overall result is too \"common\" or \"flat\".\n\nMy advise would be to find slightly less familiar typefaces to start with for the logotype.\n\nYou might something apealing at [http://www.macrhino.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322135658/http:/www.macrhino.com/ \"http://www.macrhino.com\")\n\nGood luck\n\n"
