Based on this, I would guess this is a custom work, but I would be interested if anyone knows more.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Artwork was done by Me Company (background picture credit go to Pierre & Gilles). Does Rian Hughes had any relation with Me Company at this period ? As you said Bald Condensed, the general feel makes you think of Miserichordia, well some other fonts he made give me that feeling too.\n\n"
