  "content": "Hello! I am a student studying type in a few of my classes.   \n   \nI am an InDesign user. I find that it is way more user-friendly than Quark is, and it is more efficent to use all Adobe programs.   \n   \nHowever, my school only uses Quark. In the past, I've been using InDesign in the developing stages, before doing the final work on Quark. Yes, that's how much I can't stand Quark!   \n   \nAs the workload is increasing (this is my junior year), it's getting to be too cumbersome to hop between the two programs.   \n   \nIs there a way to export documents out of InDesign so Quark can open them? Or vice versa? I've tried to figure out a way, but unsuccessfully. I was wondering if anyone could shed light on this.   \n   \nThanks!\n\n",

If you absolutely have to get InDesign material into QuarkXPress, then you shoul dgive it a whirl. But based on user reports on the BlueWorld InDesign mailing list, I would not want to make it a regular, ongoing workflow.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"
