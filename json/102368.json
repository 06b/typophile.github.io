None of the employees seems to have a soft copy of their logo and I was hoping to recreate something very similar in Adobe/Illustrator. Does anyone have any idea what fonts are utilized? I am especially interested in trying to figure out the script font used in \"Eddie's\", but would love to know the font used in \"Tire\" as well. I would be grateful for any feedback that any of the forum members might have. I really would like to help her out. Thank you for your time and knowledge.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822043242im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_4374.JPG)\n\n",
