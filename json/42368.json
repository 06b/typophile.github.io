  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am currently working on a new logo for a carpenter company called \"HTG\" who make gymnasium interiors etc.\n\nThe client actually came up with the logo idea. The \"T\" is a technical structure they use on a daily basis, so it seemed reasonable to me to make a logo out of it. What do you guys think? Has this logo got potential? If so, what could be improved?\n\nThanks for any feedback.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019134939im_/http:/typophile.com/files/HTG_6703.png)\n\n",

Currently, it's not clearly reading as \"HTG\" to me - might be best to sketch out different letter sizes, styles, and placements for the H & G to get it to read more clearly. Overall - cool!\n\n"
