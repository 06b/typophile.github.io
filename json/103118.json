I've seen this fon in one or two places already so, I think it's a famous one.\n\nIt's a bold/curly/fantasy font. I suspect it's a free one.\n\nCan anybody help?\n\nGonSch\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Bajo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011164108/http:/typophile.com/files/Bajo.jpg) | 109.73 KB |\n\n",
