I don’t know why no one has made a mainstream digital version of this, because it is still seen in use all the time.\n\nThere _are_ digital version out there, including David Rakowski’s [Adineski Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203221208/http:/www.faces.co.uk/fonts/Intecsas/Adineski-Bold-IN20125/), Fontbank’s [Caricature](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203221208/http:/www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/caricature.htm) and Cancun on CorelDraw CDs.\n\n"
