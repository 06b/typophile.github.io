But chirography in turn imposes its own grid, it's just not a Cartesian one: it promotes a certain overt modularity among many letter structures (think of the b/d/p/q) that goes against the divergence our reading mechanism needs.\n\nShame - it's such a pretty fish.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Of course, if you do it in a banal and simplistic way, you will get the kind of results that Hrant decries. But the tool (and methodologies derived from it) cannot be dismissed just because a few, or even many, practitioners use it in a naive manner.\n\nIn this example of the textus quadratus, a 14th century scribe is certainly not droning throught the alphabet with \"overt modularity\", but giving the reader plenty of divergence.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013094307im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bdqp_4418.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "In my view, Hrant you have hold of a partial truth which you generalize to the point where is at the very least misleading.\n\nType, especially the roman lower case, was originally based on pen-formed letters. The very formation of these letters is influenced by the broad-nibbed pen. And in a number of ways the broad pen helped produce some aspects of readability, by automatically making 'optical corrections' to shapes and joins. For example, a vertical bar appears thinner than a horizontal bar of the same width. The broad pen, held at eg 30% produces broader verticals. Also joins, such as in the 'a' are naturally narrowed by the broad pen, making them look less 'clotted'. Also it may be that serifs, that are to a certain extent natural to the hand-moved pen, help produce more balanced letters.\n\nNow it is also true that features of hand writing oppose readability. At TypeTech in New York last month, I was sitting next to the charming Cara Di Edwardo, a calligrapher who teaches at Cooper Union. She pointed out to me that writing slanted is convenient to the hand, but not to the eye. For the eye, upright is easier to read.\n\nThe Carolingian Miniscule, the basis of lower case, is a formal hand that is slower to write, more unnatural to the hand, and more readable. It also has serifs on both sides of the bottoms of the strokes (and the tops of uvwxy), which are also slower to write, and perhaps more readable.\n\nOverall, hand writing cannot achieve the same evenness of color that type does. This was a key advance of Jenson and Griffo, who realized that making type more evenly colored than hand writing would make it more readable. And this is why typographic letters are almost always different from pen-written letters. (I am not speaking of built up letters. of course, which can be typographic.)\n\nThe roman lower case, then, is essentially a pen-written script modified for more even color. So the truth here, I think, is as Van Krimpen put it, that type is not 'chirographic', but it always retains an underlying influence, an \"underlying force\" of the pen. This is why, contrary to Hrant, I think it is valuable to be aware what the pen might do and as you are designing letters when you are violating 'pen rules', which is very often.\n\n"

In contrast, armed with an astrolabe (an understanding of readability) you can cross the vast oceans by using the mysterious night sky, and hopefully (although not certainly) discover a new continent.

You can also get around by crawling on your back, naked. The question is, what's the point? I think most often the point is sadly just an artistic indulgence, at the expense of the user.\n\nhhp\n\n"

This is why Bodoni can be problematic, because the vertical black strokes are similar in weight to the vertical white spaces between them, and a 50/50 figure-ground relationship makes for nasty notan, ambiguous gestalt.\n\nThe serifs that a broad nibbed pen create serve to disambiguate the relationship between figure and ground by giving the figure more \"masculinity\".\n\nAnd the angled stress of the broad pen also serves to disambiguate positive and negative, by accentuating the differences between the \"figurality\" of each.

The negative counter figure, schematized as the boundary between positive and negative (centre).  \nIt can be seen that the negative figure is more angular than the positive and differently skewed, and these qualities -- presumed to be instrumental in a notan/gestalt theory of readability -- are a direct result of chirographic structure.

Is it true? I don't know. But my point about awareness is that we don't really yet understand fully what are the advantages and disadvantages of the pen-written moving front.\n\nMy basic problem with Hrant's view is that it pretends to more knowledge than any of us, including Hrant, have. So when we mess around with, eg. the pen-influenced traditional stress on the Cap A or M, we'd better be aware of it, and see whether we are making things better or worse.\n\nIt isn't a matter of romanticism, but just appropriate modesty, and appreciation of the strength of the hundreds of years' tradition of people making typographic letters, and the thousands of years before that of pen-written letters.\n\n"

Furthermore, as Nick's admirable c shows, divergence between exterior and interior axes is not just possible but natural in type pretty faithful to the broad nib. As long as the designer understands which is the means and which the end, there's not a problem. If he doesn't, the danger is that he restricts himself unnecessarily to just a subset of the possibilities for black-white tension, and uncritically accepts other properties given glyphs by the broad nib, like line weight at certain angles, as a package. I also agree with Hrant that the idea of a skeleton inside the glyph isn't useful.\n\nRedge, I think you'll come to find that you appreciate different qualities in text and display. It's normal to acquire an interest and independent taste in display type first, which may or may not drift towards or expand to include text type. This isn't just an intellectual thing either, one's immediate aesthetic responses change. Neither is it a matter of a binary switch: I now find good type most attractive when set a good deal smaller than I did eight months ago.

OMT occurs at around 86 Hz, and is presumed to function to prevent image fade by constantly stiumulating the retina. However, as has been noted by Paul Kainen, it also registers patterns, by creating an interference field.  \n [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/kainen/topoliss.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013094307/http:/www.georgetown.edu/faculty/kainen/topoliss.pdf \"http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/kainen/topoliss.pdf\")  \nPage 8-9.\n\nRaph's Fourier analyses (shown on Typophile last year) demonstrate that repetitive texture is a quality of typography.\n\nTherefore, it seems reasonable that OMT would play a role in the global perception of type in mass layout, rather than through sequential reading with normal saccades.\n\nThere needs to be some explanation of why a skilled proofreader can look at a page of text and spot a typo immediately. So I hypothesize that learning to read fluently exploits OMT to perceive certain qualities of text globally, and that the rhythm or text color that typographers speak of is part of this awareness.\n\n"

To avoid a discussion in a thread not suitable for the subject I was sent here.\n\nI must say I find this discussion rather strange. I think it's good to discuss both advantages and limitations of calligraphy but I don't think it even should be relied on completely. As such, I don't understand people's discontent with chirography.\n\nI have to admit I sometimes do some calligraphy to find interesting letter shapes but I haven't used any of them yet. My process — so far, anyway — is completely digital. I think I don't even need to rely on chirography because we have hundreds of years of typefaces based on chirography, and typefaces based on chirography-based typefaces and so forth. It's really strange to me to disregard its value.\n\nI thought Noordzij's theory was very enlightening and in a way it made my world of type design richer. However that doesn't mean people should rely on it, but it has given me great insight in how letters are constructed and how they behave, and furthermore gives me the liberty to consciously break type design rules.\n\nYou would also think that calligraphy couldn't possibly bring new shapes anymore, but I completely disagree with that as well. My high contrast sans grotesque 'Dagon Sans' was inspired by calligraphic principles, and I also have a several calligraphic letter forms on paper which could potentially be the basis for new typefaces. For example, I made an 'a' with an unconventional serif and weight build-up but it looks very nice. I wouldn't know if it works at all throughout a complete typeface, but I think that's the fun of chirography.\n\nI also wonder if a typeface like Legato could've been developed at all without a chirographic approach.\n\n\\> Basically, it favors the black bodies of letters (by tying the two edges of the  \n\\> black, via a marking tool/metaphor) and this impedes the optimal formation of notan  \nThat's assuming you're using your calligraphic pen in a fixed position instead of subtly rotate.

I'm doing the Type@Cooper program this summer, the condensed one with Hannes Famira and Just van Rossum, so I'm guessing this will be more like the KABK's approach since they both studied with Noordzij.\n\nMy personal take (and this is liable/likely to change, or at least evolve, in the future): the Noordzij approach seems really useful for a singular, focused approach towards gaining an ingrained hand-eye understanding of letterforms. As someone with fairly decent bezier drawing skills and computer skills in general, the sketching/calligraphy bit is the part I would really like to gain an understanding of. But I also would never want to become a fervent disciple of The Stroke and The Stroke alone -- it just seems like a good foundation. I think of it sort of like drawing classes in most design programs. You will probably never be asked to illustrate a bowl of fruit or a draped sheet in charcoal during your career, but gaining that fundamental understanding of form and graphic interpretation is key to being able to move on to more common forms of illustration.\n\n"

That said, I personally think that -if you're not careful- the Noordzij approach can become a \"foundation\" the way cement shoes are a foundation... :-/\n\nKABK seems to be incredibly good at getting student to quickly produce highly polished, salable fonts in a certain style. Reading doesn't do that as well, as quickly; but to me education isn't about production. When I was invited to speak to the Reading students this past June, and got to talk more deeply with their instructors concerning how they like to teach, I was very happy to see how they try so hard to let the student develop their own views, in fact at the expense of passing along theirs; the students attest to this as well. Most people simply can't produce high-quality fonts in one year without the instructors exerting an undue influence. And I personally always want to see new people in type design, not proxies of existing people.\n\nRelated - see my comment here:  \n [http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/quintet/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013094307/http:/typographica.org/typeface-reviews/quintet/ \"http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/quintet/\")\n\nYou will undoubtedly learn much from Type@Cooper.

But for now let me keep this particular train rolling.\n\nJohn, there indeed remain some unexplored corners of the Chirographic Continent, and it's entirely possible that some of those corners might contain gold; but when it seems much more promising -if also risky- to cross over to other continents, it just seems wasteful not to; our time on this earth is not unlimited. Also, to me most chirographic designers don't seem sufficiently preoccupied with discovery - they generally seem principally interested in elaboration/refinement.

The thing is, when you say \"there is no need to overemphasize anything at the expense of closing doors\", looking at the output of KABK students there does seem to be a single door that's left much more open to the students than any other door; Reading isn't like that.\n\nBut beyond that, practically speaking one tries to balance exploration and production, and the latter requires you to adopt a stance, so you can actually make something. This doesn't mean the stance is Perfect, and it doesn't mean changing you mind is evil. But being a 100% relativist is guaranteed to leave you with zero usable output.\n\nhhp\n\n"

They're neither overtly calligraphic, nor conventional serif fonts, already at one remove from calligraphy. Since they're perfectly legitimate faces, I will readily agree that type designers can escape from being tightly bound to calligraphy.\n\nThen there are the display faces that look like MICR characters or 5 x 7 dot-matrix characters.\n\n@hrant:  \n<cite>Also, to me most chirographic designers don't seem sufficiently preoccupied with discovery - they generally seem principally interested in elaboration/refinement.

The \"high art\" tradition, where the focus is on doing something that's never been done before, instead of on craftsmanship building in a small way on what one's predecessors have accomplished, is very much alive and well - and present in type design, despite the presence of craftsmanlike thinking there as well.\n\nThere's a place for both types of endeavors, and it doesn't make sense to ask those in one camp to move to another. On the other hand, if you are deploring the lack of designs aimed at mainstream purposes that make use of innovative ideas - that show that a typeface can be an effective tool to convey information without being solely steeped in tradition - then I don't disagree with the sentiment. I would just point out Optima as something I consider to be one of the few exceptions to that, to show there is some cross-fertilization between the avant-garde and the mainstream, even if it is limited and slow.\n\nEDIT: Further thought on this issue is bringing me around to acknowledging the importance of the issue, rather than just feeling you are being impatient.\n\nIt's natural for designers who are aiming at the utility of their product to stick with what is tried and true, and it's also natural for those whose purpose is \"Hey! Look at me!\" not to try and design typefaces that avoid being distracting (a near-prerequisite to usefulness), but these tendencies, natural though they are, _are_ potentially sufficiently limiting that it does make sense to urge a conscious effort to resist them on both sides of that divide.\n\n"
