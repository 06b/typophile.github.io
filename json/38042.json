I want to say it is on West Broadway somewhere between Grand St. and Spring Street.\n\nHave fun!\n\n"

      "content": "The shop in Soho is a Taschen bookstore, I believe (unless Phaidon has also opened up a shop), so it probably won’t be worth spending much time there. They will stock their own publications exclusively, most of which are available at any of the big chain bookshops. The Cooper-Hewitt has a good selection, and is worth the trip (2 interesting exhibitions on as well—Piranesi and Ingo Maurer). The MoMA design stores have some books as well, though their main bookshop in the museum is very weak (or was when I was last there).  \nHave fun!\n\n"
