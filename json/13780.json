  "content": "The theme is 1967/1968 gangster. Imagine a very Brigitte Bardot/Faye Dunaway looking girl against the door of an Astin Martin, quietly holding a gun. Think gangsters, elegant, British...\n\nWhat I am looking for are typefaces that would be evocative of this—work in this period. Of course, the 1930’s Bonnie & Clyde visual comes to mind, but I am looking for something more late 60’s.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions?\n\n",

Speaking of whom, David Bailey, another East End lad, had photographed them in the mid 60s. He also shot the Stones, so that gives me a mod, Compacta/Impact vibe. The Krays were hardcore psycopaths, and once the full nature of their crimes became apparent in court (eg slicing off people's faces), their glamour disappeared (for 20 years, at least). Get Carter is an awesome film, but after the 60s. There is a definite fault line there, somewhere around the Beatles breaking up. I think the Get Carter typeface in its poster is Gill Kayo.\n\n"

But I don't think anyone would expect a gangster to be equipped with an Aston Martin or Bardot, while Carter had a Jag and Britt in 1971 not that far from 68. A more obvious reference would be the Italian Job (attractive cars and women) which was made before the need for an identity was regarded as a necessary marketing tool to a movie – the original British poster was a blocky almost constructivist sans, while another British one was almost Brody-esque and the American one looks like a Didone.  \nBTW Avant Garde was produced in the early 1970s wasn't it?  \nTim\n\n"
