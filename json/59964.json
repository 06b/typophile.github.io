  "content": "I remember seeing a font that I absolutely loved - but since I saw it in a magazine that wasnt mine (and that didnt list the fonts they were using) I dont know the name of the font.. but even worse, I dont have any pictures of it.. So I have really quickly drawn a sketch of the letter M to get the feeling of what the font is about. The curl is the main ingredient of the font..\n\nSo if you know any kind of font that may look a bit like my bad sketch, do not hesitate to name drop!!\n\nThank you so very very very much!!! ;o)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Bilde 5.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130317140151/http:/typophile.com/files/Bilde%205_0.png) | 8.14 KB |\n\n",
