The upper case Q is identical to the gothic 13 Q that i’ve attached. same for the lower case t, which is pretty distinctive. however, the uppercase R doesn’t match Gothic 13’s.\n\nany of you guys know any typefaces that also have these characteristics, other than old Gothic 13?:\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Q.gif](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=Q.gif) | 1.45 KB |\n| [t.gif](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=t.gif) | 1.06 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "yeah. one of the inspirations for champion and knockout has got to be it. the upper case R is just like Franklin gothic bold condensed- i’m still holding out that it’s all in the same semi-mysterious old wood typeface, but there’s always the possibility that someone mixed characters from different families. the lower case t is so recognizeable- definitely not franklin gothic.\n\n"
