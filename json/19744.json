      "content": "Looks good.  \nSome of the characters don't seem wide enough like the a, e, h, k, s, m, n and u. I'd probably redesign the w.\n\nI think stylistically the clamp-like shapes your using give the font a very utilitarian/ strong look which really works with the b, d, g, p, q and r. They don't work as well with the h, m and the n. The point on the top of the p seems to work but i think with these letters it's too distracting.\n\nThe lowercase o also could be redone so it has a more consistent weight with the rest of the font.\n\nIs there an uppercase? How does it look in text?\n\n"

      "content": "Wow, very nice. That \"e\" is da bomb.\n\n- I would shorten the descenders.  \n- The right side of the foot serifs in \"f\" and \"r\" should be longer.  \n- I might tilt the head serifs in \"i\" and \"j\" (and maybe \"u\") downward.  \n- k: needs more presence.  \n- o: might actually work!  \n- r: beak join crappy.  \n- s: super.  \n- t: too wide.  \n- v, w: not enough character. Try bending stuff.  \n- y: tail too clunky.\n\nBTW, if you make lighter weights, apply high stroke weight contrast.\n\nhhp\n\n"
