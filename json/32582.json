I'm pretty sure that is not Venus or any of the Gothics. I don't think we've got Proenza Schouler either. I don't mean to presume, but I wish someone could nail these the way bjharvey and Bald Condensed nailed Marc Jacobs in 2004. If I'm wrong and in fact marcox's i.d.'s are correct, I will be happy. I just want to get these right.\n\nIt's the E in ANNE KLEIN that is most interesting, and the O in Proenza Schouler that is not quite fitting with the suggestions. Here is an attempt at a better image of ANNE KLEIN.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110812150454im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Anne%202_4034.gif)\n\n"
