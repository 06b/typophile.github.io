  "content": "I came about a font called Ballardvale, which somewhat looks like Melior or Renault. But the font I saw is called Ballardvale medium-condensed, and having searched for Google, I saw no results. Could someone give me some information, or hopefully, any links to buy the font? Thank you.\n\n",

There is a Ballardvale series used by Balfour-Taylor, the giant yearbook publisher in the US, although the PDF I found doesn't show a condensed version. There is a trainer for Balfour, Hal Schmidt, located in Houston, TX who might shed some light on the origin of the font. His email is hal -at- halschmidt dot com\n\n"

      "content": "Compugraphic was a US manufacturer of typesetting machines, and in the 1980s they copied popular typefaces and sold them as proprietary fonts to use with their machines. To avoid lawsuits from the foundries that issued the original fonts, Compugraphic gave their copies new names. Palatino became \"Palomino,\" Optima became \"Oracle,\" and Frutiger became \"Frontiera.\" Compugraphic's Melior knockoff went by several names, one of which was \"Ballardvale,\" named after the street in Wilmington, Massachusetts where their headquarters was.\n\n"

The typeface collections of Stempel, Compugraphic and Bitstream all went to Monotype. In many cases the Compugraphic and Bitstream knock-offs were withdrawn from the market.
