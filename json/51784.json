  "content": " **The Problem**  \nMany of us have wanted to license a complete font family but cannot afford to do so at the present time. So we purchase only one or two weights that we really need.\n\nBut later when we are able to afford the whole family, we are told that we have to either purchase the whole family at the full price (essentially paying for the single weights we purchased earlier all over again) or we can get a nominal discount.\n\nFontshop, for example, allows you to pay the difference if you buy the single weights and then you buy the whole family later inside the same month. The issue with this is that if you can't afford to purchase the whole family right now, that situation is unlikely to change inside a month. It may take you many months or even a year or two to be able to do it.\n\nThough I am sure this makes a lot of business sense from the point of view of the business, it is not as friendly & helpful as it could be from the point of view of the consumer.\n\n**One Happy Solution**  \nIn the economic climate we all now live in, I want to point out [Vllg.com's \"taste test\" policy](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019233957/http:/www.vllg.com/tastetest.php) as one example of what a truly upgrade-friendly consumer-oriented purchasing policy looks like. Their policy states:\n\n**If you purchase a single weight (or more) of any typeface we offer, then return later to buy a family set, we will credit you the amount of the original sale.**\n\nHow the program works\n\nWe know that you might want to try out one or two weights of a typeface to decide if it's right for a project you're working on. While the MudTyper and PDFs are very useful, there is nothing quite like trying out a typeface yourself.\n\nSo, you visit vllg.com and license your \"trial\" font (or fonts) and work with it for a while. A couple of hours, a couple of months, or a couple of years.\n\nIf you decide you want to get a family set, just come back to vllg.com and purchase a license online. Send us a note on the checkout page or via email and we will deduct the original cost of your \"trial\" fonts from your family order.\n\nA policy like this encourages us to purchase more fonts from them to try out, knowing full well that they will allow us to pay the difference if we want to come back and get the whole family, even if it is years later.\n\nWhat do you think of this \"taste test\" policy? Do you know of other upgrade-friendly type foundries that are willing to do what they can to help the customer not pay twice for the same fonts?\n\nRahim\n\n",

The question I'm posing is: if the Village offer makes \"a lot of sense\" to you, then surely some part of you understands that the retail principle cannot be the one-ring-to-rule-them-all approach to selling your product.\n\nLet's keep the conversation going, without getting personal, defensive, and, yes, mean-spirited.\n\nRahim\n\n"

      "content": "\"You are the one who started a thread named “Paying Twice For The Same Fonts”, which is a provocative distortion.\"\n\nOh, please. Enough with the histrionics. Just because it doesn't fit your business model doesn't mean he's making a \"provocative distortion.\" Rahim's original post was thoughtful, and not in any way an insult to the standard way of doing things for most businesses (type foundries, butchers, etc.). He was posing a question, plain and simple, and speaking from the consumer's point of view (you know, the people who keep you in business).\n\nAnd no matter how you want to phrase it, you are indeed paying for the same font twice from many foundries if you buy one, and then come back and pay full price for the whole family. Yes, we understand that that's how it's generally done with fonts, and all sorts of other things. Yes, we understand that there are volume discounts when buying the whole family at once (which we all appreciate). And yes, we understand that the current system works quite well for many foundries and that doesn't make them evil. But Village's system is very attractive, and certainly in my case would encourage me to buy from them.\n\nI would not expect to go to the hardware store, buy a quart of paint for $10, and then come back the next day and have them sell me 3/4 of a gallon at a discounted price (i.e. the price of a full gallon minus the $10 I paid for the quart).\n\nBut if they offered that, it would certainly be appealing to a lot of people who want to try out paint colors. I doubt anyone thinks that Home Depot is ripping them off because they don't offer that. And if I sent an e-mail to Home Depot suggesting they do that, I really doubt they'd use the phrase \"greedy heart\" in their response to me.\n\n\"And you’re making out like I’m ripping people off?!  \nDo the math, get a life, make some money, and if you’re offered a deal, don’t go dissing whoever made it because they’re not as “upgrade friendly” as your greedy heart desires.\"\n\nI think it's safe to say that \\_that\\_ was mean-spirited.\n\n"

Then how is a non-standard amount paid? Shopping cart software is set up to handle fixed prices associated with specific product packages.  \nI'm sure the amount of customer service time involved would be worth the sale, but there are so many marketing services that can be added to a business, and I generally try to keep things simple. I figure a deep discount on family packages is practical, as might be offering the basic font in a family for free (no Paying Twice there!)--but this refund business just strikes me as unnecessarily complicated.  \nI'd rather by designing fonts (or arguing about it on Typophile) than implementing it.\n\n"

It shows our clients the respect they show us by licensing our types. Similarly, all of our licensing is cumulative, so that clients can add to the number of computers they have covered without any unnecessary extra outlay.\n\nMost of our policies were created to balance our needs with the needs of our clients. We run on the Golden Rule. Which is why we have our licensing tables clearly accessible from every typeface page, offer Supersets and smaller Essential/Basic sets, and don't make people create accounts to use our site. (V2 of the site will allow for clients to create accounts if they wish which will make it much easier for them (and us) to manage Taste Tests, upgrades, etc.)\n\nIt's really painless to manage Taste Test orders; it takes around 90 seconds to get into our e-commerce system, make the necessary adjustments, and send files to clients.\n\nNick, we have not copyrighted the idea at all, although we wouldn't be too thrilled to see another foundry with a \"Taste Test\". Any other name is fair game. Another company with a similar scheme is Apple, where you can \"Complete My Album\" at the iTunes Store.\n\nThanks to Rahim for the original post.

When I entered the field at a type house the prices for a font were outrageous by our standards, not to mention the machinery you would have to have had. Fast forward a couple of decades and I giggle at someone whining at paying 19.95 for a font, much less a couple of hundred dollars for the full family. Discount or no discount!\n\nFlat out... type is a bargain!\n\nMichael\n\n"

How they price the fonts is up to them. As an independent designer, I can attest that having a system in place that minimizes the book keeping and clerical time is a must. So what if a smaller foundry doesn't follow every pricing trend. I need what they make, and I'm glad to have so many options for testing and experimentation, often in advance of a purchase.\n\n"

But one thing to consider is that FontShop currently carries fonts from 66 foundries and growing, while Vllg carries 10; formulating a new sales policy with collaboration and unanimity amongst so many parties is quite a task. This is most likely why the standard among font resellers is a simpler model than Village's exception. And as has been mentioned, we feel that we do give back to our customers, and the community as a whole, in the form of such offerings as Font Magazine, FontBooklet, FontStruct.com, FontFeed, newsletters, etc.\n\nThat said, we certainly take customer opinion seriously, and we'll continue to have internal discussions regarding this particular point of sales policy. We'll keep the community posted if any changes are made down the road.\n\nIvan\n\nFontShop Sales & Support\n\n"

      "content": "Some observations:\n\n\\* I started this post to highlight what one foundry is doing that is appealing to those who of us that have limited budgets. I invite you to re-read my own words from the beginning.\n\n\\* In my second post, I explicitly said that even though I admire Village for their \"taste test\" policy, it does not mean that I diss other foundries for not having a similar policy.\n\n\\* I respect how FontShop, Veer, ShinnType, OurType, Type-Together, and so many others conduct their business. If they don't have a similar policy, it's not as helpful to me as Village's policy, but so be it. I still love their work and the amazing talent of the designers. I will still purchase fonts from them. Some other posters on this thread will not. Can you identify the difference between my approach and theirs?\n\n\\* I did not use the \"times are tough, lower your prices\" argument. What I said was, in these difficult economic times, a policy like Village's Taste Test upgrade policy was appealing and friendly.\n\nI'm not \\*telling\\* other foundries how to price their fonts. The whole thread started as a conversation about what type of purchasing and upgarding policy might be helpful to the limited-budget consumer. At no point have I wanted Village to \"lower\" its prices because I think their prices are too high. It's about the upgrading policy, not the prices. It's a subtle distinction but I hope it can be discerned.\n\n\\* There's this idea that if you don't like my business policy, spend your money elsewhere. But don't try to have a conversation with me about it. Any such conversation can only be \"a malignant effort to manipulate public opinion.\"\n\nWell, no one is lining up outside your office with pitch forks and torches. This is a forum. This is a place to have conversations. It's not just about markets and money, it's also about ideas and conversations and exchanges and partnerships and the acknowledgment that we are all living in a mutually interdependent ecosystem.\n\nEvery new idea was once considered \"a malignant effort to manipulate public opinion\" and those who spearheaded these kinds of efforts were quickly given a hemlock latte with extra whip.\n\nIt is simply not helpful to tell us to \"stop whining, get a life, get a job, etc\": essentially, drink your hemlock and shut up.\n\nNo one is threatening you and your business and your right to earn a living. Please proceed as usual, and much success to you. Live and let live.\n\nMy original intent/suggestion was actually very simple:\n\nVillage's Taste Test policy, wonderful idea, wonder if other foundries already do something similar, wonder if it helps us make more purchases and helps them make more money and support their business efforts.\n\nWonder if we could create more win-win situations in the typeface purchasing world through ideas \\*like\\* this, not necessarily identical to this?\n\nI sincerely hope I have been clear about my position.\n\nRahim\n\n"

I just happen to personally know a whole lot of people who exercise that profession, and I'm _so_ fed up with the recurring attacks on how they choose to earn their livelihood. You just have the misfortune of having started one too many such a thread.\n\nAnd can somebody _please_ explain to me why nobody is picketing the offices of the movie companies because you don't get a refund when you buy a deluxe triple-disc DVD with all the trimmings when you already bought a VHS tape of that same movie years ago? Or a refund from the restaurant when you notice you're still hungry after eating your starters and you order an additional dish?\n\n"

And demand a partial refund. My client branches out in Central Europe, so I need to purchase a license for Sansa Professional. And demand a partial refund. But then I want to diversify the design a bit, and I purchase a license for Sansa Soft. And demand a partial refund. At some point I need a serif face to match all of those, and I purchase a license for Sansa Slab. And demand a partial refund.\n\nHow the flying firetruck do you expect anyone to keep track of this unholy mess? It's fairly simple if you are a boutique type shop like Village and it's great that they offer this, but for a large font vendor this is a card-carrying logistic nightmare.\n\n"
