MS Office has built in Unicode, but most other apps will have only very limited capability.   \n   \nOf course, upgrading to Windows XP will probably require upgrading your hardware also ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023222233im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "There have been many models of that laptop. How much RAM do you have? What type and speed of CPU? How big is your hard drive, and how much free space do you currently have?   \n   \nWorst, although it is quite possible to do an \"upgrade install\" that leaves your current OS install kind of intact and migrates apps and stuff over to the new one, such installs are often frought with problems. Most experts recommend instead doing a \"clean install\" which wipes out your OS and basically hoses all your application installations, meaning you need to reinstall all apps. Major pain here if you have a lot of applications.   \n   \nAnd if you're going that far, you probably ought to move the hard drive over to NTFS formatting, which means wiping the whole hard drive, including your data files. So you'd need to do a full backup of data first.   \n   \n ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023222233im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
