  "content": "So I really would like to know what those special glyphs inside of Bello's glyph-set are called? So for example the glyphs that say \"the\" or \"and\" or \"the end\" etc.\n\nI know these are part of a glyph set but I'm wondering is there any particular terminology for these types of glyphs? If so what are they called?\n\nAlso, does anyone know of any good typefaces that have these as part of their glyph set? Or any typefaces that are simply word based as opposed to letter based?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Of the more recent designs [Now Playing](http://web.archive.org/web/20140702081011/http:/www.terminaldesign.com/customfonts/nowplaying/) (by James Montalbano; Terminal Design) comes to mind first.
