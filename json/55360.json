It is an offset lithograph. I really like the designer's use of vibrant color to bring life to the poster. While looking through Milton Glaser's work, I found that his use of vibrant color is apparent in most of his work. His designs are very visually intriguing, and the viewer's eye is constantly moving over the design.\n\n",
