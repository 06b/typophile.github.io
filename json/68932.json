I don't have it, so i can't check it for myself.\n\n[http://www.gestalten.com:8080/shop/images/upload/fonts/933/13472f\\_10736d...](http://web.archive.org/web/20130801075834/http:/www.gestalten.com:8080/shop/images/upload/fonts/933/13472f_10736d729a2_-7fc5.pdf \"http://www.gestalten.com:8080/shop/images/upload/fonts/933/13472f\\_10736d729a2\\_-7fc5.pdf\")\n\nThanks.\n\n",
