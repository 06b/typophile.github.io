  "content": "Hello all. Please let me know if this has been answered elsewhere.   \n   \nI need to set a sentence with an em dash. But, because of space reasons, the sentence needs to break. How would I set something like the example below? Does the em dash go to the top line or the bottom one?   \n   \nexample   \nblah blah blah--   \nblah blah etc   \n   \nOR do you place it like so:   \n   \nexample   \nblah blah blah   \n--blah blah etc   \n   \nI remember seeing an article that covers this situation but I can't seem to find it at the moment.\n\n",

      "content": "Felici's 'Compete Manual of Typography' says that much typesetting software sees an em or en dash as an appropriate place to break a line. So I guess the first would be the common wisdom.   \n   \nBringhurst in 'Elements of Typographic Style' recommends using en dashes to set off phrases,with a word space before and after. The em dash he recommends using only to introduce dialogue (beginning the sentence), which he says is the European practice.\n\n"
