In addition, Photo-Lettering had many styles that seem to be extremely similar, with completely different names. Arctic seems quite close, but nothing I saw was absolutely identical. It's possible that custom lettering was done for them by one of the lettering artists who did these similar film types.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Of digital fonts I would say Arctic2, by Sam Wang is the closest I could find. URW has digitized a number of similar scripts, but in different weights, such as Arab Brushstroke, Contemporary Brush, [April](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723071227/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/april/) (which is a lot like Arctic, but condensed), and Amber (which is like a bold April). I think these all were originally Filmotype typefaces.\n\n(I didn't link all of these, since most of them are less like your sample)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
