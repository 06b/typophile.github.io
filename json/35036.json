What are the main technical issues with using them on the web in a UTF-8 document?\n\nThe main issue—that I have found—with ligatures on the web is lack of search engine support. A search engine such as Google does not understand that ‘ [ﬁnd](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825115852/http:/www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%EF%AC%81nd&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)’ and ‘ [find](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825115852/http:/www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=find&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)’ means the same.\n\n [‹ Making OTF problem](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825115852/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35058 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Embedded bitmaps in TTF in Windows ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825115852/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34903 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
