At the moment I’m looking for a serif typeface, maybe in italic to use for quotes, introduction texts and so on. If you have any thoughts on which serif that would work well as a delicate supplemant to Interstate, it would be very much appreciated.\n\n [‹ Universal Penman - What version?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007175742/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40991 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What are your favorite Didone typefaces? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007175742/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41028 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
