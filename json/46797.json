I probably should not have gotten rid of the background with Photoshop, since my quick-and-dirty moves to do so altered the pixels a bit, inconsistently. Here’s the original (from an Oklahoma fundraising license plate), though up-rezzed, otherwise it would be tiny:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080629055615im_/http:/typophile.com/files/plate5wlcscis2_4173.jpg)\n\n"

Just went ahead and started with Dom Casual Bold, then hand-modified it to match fairly closely. Redrew W, C, e, and a from scratch, for the rest I modified the Dom glyphs. Could have spent more time redrawing new glyphs, such as the lowercase s and maybe v as well, but felt I’d put in enough time by that point and decided to call it good. (Has to match pretty closely, but perfectly exact not a requirement.) Appreciate the input!\n\n"
