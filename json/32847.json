  "content": "Hi everybody, I'm posting my topic because I've never sold a font yet and I don't know anything about licences. I've found in my cupboard some old letraset press-type fonts. I've decided to digitalize the [Neil Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20141021163543/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Neil%20Bold) by scanning it for a school magazine that I'm creating now. Then I realize that a lot of people was looking for this font on the Internet and they asked me if I'll sell it. The problem is that it was already digitalized by OPTIFonts but they aren't selling it anymore. There is also a \"based on\" font which is Alejandro Paul’s Mobley Sans but generally it stray far from the look of Neil Bold. Now I'm wondering that if none is selling it and if I digitalized it from the original letraset, do I have the right to propose my font to a foundry ?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [neil.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20141021163543/http:/typophile.com/files/neil.pdf) | 34.27 KB |\n\n",

It seemed like the perfect set of letterforms for our logo. I found out a few years later that Chartpak's Vector was VGC's Neil Bold. So as long as you don't use the trademarked name I can't see a problem as long as you don't mind being a derivative pirate.\n\n"
