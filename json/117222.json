For the text there are a serif and a sans (maybe Futura?) and a sans for the titles(all in uppercase). There is anybody that can help me?  \nThank you a lot!\n\n[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/\\_Fh2aCkgfh6Q/TEqoWtIAjQI/AAAAAAAAA70/-Dgr4EIFWd...](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725134913/http:/3.bp.blogspot.com/_Fh2aCkgfh6Q/TEqoWtIAjQI/AAAAAAAAA70/-Dgr4EIFWd8/s1600/2.jpg \"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/\\_Fh2aCkgfh6Q/TEqoWtIAjQI/AAAAAAAAA70/-Dgr4EIFWd8/s1600/2.jpg\")\n\n",

Pischner (1928) might be a match, including the leg on the \\_R\\_ in the version \"Neuzeit Book -S.\" Other versions have a different leg on the \\_R\\_.  \nBut this is three years after the publication date. Perhaps an earlier design by Pischner? More digging needed.  \nDon\n\n"

Because the English text would suggest a later translation.  \nAnyway, for what I can tell, at least the bold type seems the same in German too (see, for example: [http://culturevisuelle.org/icones/files/2013/09/moholy\\_MFF\\_dynamik-gross...](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725134913/http:/culturevisuelle.org/icones/files/2013/09/moholy_MFF_dynamik-grossstadt.jpg \"http://culturevisuelle.org/icones/files/2013/09/moholy\\_MFF\\_dynamik-grossstadt.jpg\")).\n\n"

The discussion sample is definitely not the original edition, everything is set with a complete different sans close to [Halogen](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725134913/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/halogen) or [Idlewid](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725134913/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/idlewild/overview).\n\n"
