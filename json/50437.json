Not as good as most of the stuff in here but I'm hoping that you'll find it useful in some way.\n\nYou can grab a copy of it here: [Quicksand](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320133323/http:/www.andrewpaglinawan.com/typeface/QuicksandFamily.zip)\n\n",

I use M$ Word 2007 and the strange thing is that the percent character won't show up in the dokument. The place where the % should be is simply blank. Has anybody got an idea why this happens? Also, if I put in the percent character Word tends to replace the font with Times New Roman, as if this specific character was missing in Quicksand. Pretty strange I'd say...Suggestions anyone? Thanks, Tom\n\n"
