      "content": "Bob's find of Yorkville is as close as I have seen. But, based on a reasonably thorough search, my opinion is that this probably does not exist as a publicly available font. In particular I have not spotted the combination of a vertical leg on the \\_R\\_ like Helvetica but without the little kick at the bottom, \\_G\\_ with a rounded lower rhs and no spur like a compressed Futura, \\_W\\_ with a vertex that is at only about two-thirds of the letter height, and an \\_S\\_ with extended terminals similar to Helvetica. Plus the the base of \\_A\\_ is as wide as \\_O\\_.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701152436im_/http:/typophile.com/files/UnknownSansTypophile117504D_6116.jpg)\n Futurvetica anyone? \n"
