I know there has to be some shortcuts other than the pen tool. I want to figure how to pull off the rounded edges and have a perfect symmetrical icon.\n\nThanks, Donny\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [zune\\_logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018063621/http:/typophile.com/files/zune_logo.jpg) | 15.39 KB |\n\n",
