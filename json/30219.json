      "content": "Your trying to combine one concept with a graphic that has nothing to relate it to. Make the graphics and the concept driving it relate. Whats more important the look of the type or the idea that drives the promotion? “Stops at all stations” is very weak and might not read or be held open when printing. Think about the printer putting ink to paper. He/she will give you all the posters you request but the overs might be 200%. What that means is to make that super thin type hold open 1 out of 3 posters will be good and 2 out of 3 posters will end up in the trash. A very expensive design. Your design should be more than just good looking/cleaver type design.\n\n"
