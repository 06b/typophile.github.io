It struck me that the lettering succeeded in capturing the idiosyncrasies of those individual lives lived within a common framework, which was the typeface itself combined with our shared understanding of it (e.g. reading). Very moving work.\n\nInteresting to compare it to Shepard Fairey's graphically intensive [cover of Obama](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015045106/http:/www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20081229,00.html) for [Time's Person of the Year](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015045106/http:/www.time.com/time/specials/2008/personoftheyear/article/0,31682,1861543_1865068_1867014,00.html), for example. Both aim to capture the spirit of and urgency of individuals but they do so in very different ways.\n\n"
