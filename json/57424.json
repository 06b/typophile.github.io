Ideal to use on wine labels or organic food packaging, stationery and old maps. It also makes a great choice for designs relating to outdoor activities and rugged travel, where the concept of the wild is to be accentuated.\n\n**[Matogrossoâ€™s](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103132957/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000429#specimen)** OpenType programming combines several alternate lowercase characters to generate perfect fit and more natural textures.\n\nVisit **[Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103132957/http:/www.sudtipos.com/)**.\n\n",
