You have curve-straight-curve   \nthing happening + the skewed bowl shape makes the 'l' and 't' stand out as being too upright.   \nMaybe the left side of the 't' crossbar could be reined in a bit.   \n   \nalso, in context, the m feels a bit wide. the n + n usually   \nneeds to be narrowed.   \n   \nAnd the bottom of the 't' might need to dip a little lower   \nto rest on a common optical baseline.   \n   \nI'm wondering, however, how this contemporary look   \nfits in with a candle manufacturer.   \n   \ndoes the company have a website   \n   \n   \nbj   \n   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108143137im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33596.jpg)   \n   \nmight be easier for others to critique a weebit smaller. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108143137im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
