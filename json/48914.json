Some highlights of the collection are exposed in the west wing.\n\nThe Municipal Museum (Stedelĳk Museum) looks like any building in Groznij or Gruzija after shelling. It’s shut down and it’s whispered there’s overhaul going on. The collection (or part of it?) is in some frontier outpost in the harbour area.\n\nIf you like good coffee for consolation, give me a ring @ +31-6-2450-3943.

Looking at the map, I think it was Blue Pepper. But first we stopped at the Easy Times Cafe! The Rijks was awesome...if it’s closed, a train ride to The Hague gets you to the Mauritshuis and the Municipal Museum, both well worth the visit, if art is your fancy. Man...happy you!\n\n"
