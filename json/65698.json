Me for example. I give a f\\*\\*\\* in those ridiculous restrictions. If there are bugs in fonts, that I can easily fix by myself, I fix them. In case of TT-PS-conversions, I ask the foundry for a PS version, because the conversion from PS to TT is lossy and most typeface designers draw the outlines in PS modus. And in case of PS-TT-conversions I would ask the foundry, because I am able to hint a PS font, but not a TT font, at least not in a high quality.\n\n"

But I won’t take on a commission that involves violating a EULA.</cite>\n\nYou completely misunderstood me. I did not think of the few nerds who use font editors. I thought of the millions of ordinary people, who use Microsoft's Word and Adobe's Acrobat.\n\n**Experiment 1**\n\nOpen Word, type the letter \"A\" and mark it up with the TTF font \"Palatino\" supplied with Windows, but also purchasable at the Monotype website. Then select Acrobat and convert this Word file to a PDF file. The glyph of the letter \"A\" contained in this PDF file will be encrypted by this hex string:\n\n<cite>adff0000063a0d948415829305bc07949305bc8baa8e998f089990989396<br>\n98089698a1b6acd308f4f77805f7a5f8fd05bef70dbef70dbef70d08cc06<br>\nf840fe8205c4fb1a059c659e62a15e08a05e9a7194830893839585988608<br>\n9787a688b68b089383055a0783830545904b8d528b08fb0288fb0389fb03<br>\n8908839305bc07939305d68cb98e9e90089e9094978b9d088b99869f82a3<br>\n08fb13f7c805fcd406fb01fb9705785d81698b76088b7a957f9d83089d83<br>\nb886d58b089483055a078383053490408d498b08428b40894086088b06f8<br>\n5ef8c115f88e06fb8ff8f105fb93fcf105090e</cite>\n\nBut this is not the TrueType glyph of Palatino \"A\". It is a PostScript Type 1 glyph of Palatino \"A\". Adobe's Acrobat ignored the Monotype EULA and the US Copyright Law and converted this TTF font to a PostScript Type 1 font.\n\nThis means that you would have committed a copyright infringement and/or a contractual EULA infringement, because the Monotype EULA stipulates: “You agree not to adapt, modify, alter, translate, convert, or otherwise change the Font Software, or to create Derivative Works from Font Software or any portion thereof.”\n\n**Experiment 2**\n\nOpen Word, type the letter \"A\" three times and mark them up with the TTF font \"Palatino\", and then select the character options \"Outline\", \"Shaded\" and \"Relief\". In this way, Microsoft Word generates derivative versions of the Palatino \"A\". The result will look like this\n\n[www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/pala-outline.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225214427/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/pala-outline.pdf \"www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/pala-outline.pdf\")\n\nThis means that you would have committed a copyright infringement and/or a contractual EULA infringement, because the Monotype EULA stipulates: “You agree not to adapt, modify, alter, translate, convert, or otherwise change the Font Software, or to create Derivative Works from Font Software or any portion thereof.”\n\nIf fonts were \"Font Software\", I say IF, which means, IF fonts were computer programs in the sense of the US Copyright Law, then millions of Americans would commit copyright infringements by using word processing programs and by creating PDF files.\n\nIf fonts were \"Font Software\", then thousands of Monotype customers who bought TrueType fonts and who signed this bizarre Monotype EULA would commit EULA infringements by using these TrueType fonts.\n\n"

Perhaps this is for the best because in the US Congress, at least, you can bet the industries dependent upon copyright will buy off the US Congress and draft the legislation themselves (as they always have, historically).  \nSo there are very few \"bright lines\" as they say in IP law lingo.  \nThere are two general trends: EULA's, as contracts, no matter how broad, hold up in court very well. Infringement of software copyright on the other hand, has been interpreted more narrowly. This is because software is not a purely creative act like a poem - software is aimed at solving a problem and, therefore, different software which all aim to solve the same problem will tend to converge. If everyone on this thread were to go off and write a poem, there would be obvious divergence between each and every one of our efforts. (No limericks, please.) However, if we all created a Windows executable for copying a file from one directory to another, there would certainly be similarities. Therefore, the trend in determining copyright infringement of software has evolved to be much more narrow - as long as your software is not a byte-for-byte copy of something, there is considerable leeway.  \nThat's my understanding of the situation.\n\nrich\n\n"

This may place some limitations on what would otherwise be their rights.\n\nAlso, let us say that I have purchased a copy of a TrueType font, and am not licensed to convert it into an Adobe Type1 font. I use that font in a document which I am printing on a PostScript laser printer.\n\nIn doing so, I do **not** create a .pfb file that sits on my hard disk that I can use for printing documents with programs that can only use Type1 fonts.\n\nHowever, it is true that the inner workings of the PostScript print driver take the vectors of my TrueType font, and send them off to the printer in a form that looks like the vectors of a Type1 font. Infringement?\n\nNo. That's because the \"conversion\" is used solely as a temporary means of printing, locked inside the programs, and not made available. If the font supplier were to use the EULA as a means to say \"just because you bought this font, you aren't _really_ licensed to print with it\", they would be committing fraud, and the criminal law takes precedence over contract law (and, for that matter, even copyright law).\n\nAs for creating an outline or shaded version of Palatino's Greek character set, it may well be you do have a point, and it is not legal to use such a feature with some of the fonts one has on one's computer, depending on licensing, given that the font designs are protected by law - and the font design, of course, is still there _after_ something has been printed.\n\nUnder U.S. law, though, except for trademark rights to the name of the font, most of the rights pretty well end at the time of printing - although the situation may have improved a bit recently.\n\n"

      "content": "My understanding is that I cannot use any font I want in a PDF document, I can only use fonts that are licensed to be embedded that way. Adobe, however, is not responsible for my use of Adobe Distiller; when I \"print\" a word processor document out as a .PDF document, I am the one who is taking the action of embedding those fonts in the document.\n\nSince Adobe does not provide tools for extracting embedded fonts from .PDF documents, but rather the fonts are embedded there as only an essential part of allowing such documents to serve as a form of electronic paper, they aren't engaging in contributory infringement either.\n\nThe law does draw a distinction between translations that are performed internally and externally. Thus, a microprocessor might convert the instructions of a computer program into a microcode-like form, and then even cache the instructions in this form within the chip to speed up tight loops by avoiding repeating the instruction decode step. Running a computer program on such a microprocessor does not constitute \"translating\" it into another language for copyright purposes, because it does not have the consequence of allowing people to use the program on other computers with a different instruction set.\n\nCurrently, there is a lawsuit going on between IBM and the maker of an Itanium-based machine that emulates IBM mainframes, because it uses just-in-time compilation that performs the translation externally - so this is a complicated area of law. On the other hand, Apple felt that they were unlikely to be sued by software vendors for their system for providing PowerPC emulation on Intel Macintosh computers using the same technology.\n\nEmbedded fonts in a PDF document aren't inside a chip, but since they are locked inside the document, font vendors may allow their fonts to be used for creating such documents. But you are correct that they're not obliged to allow this. But the onus of compiance is with individual users of Adobe products, not on Adobe - Acrobat Distiller has a legitimate and valuable purpose which has nothing to do with stealing fonts.\n\n"
