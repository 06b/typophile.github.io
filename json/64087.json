With the right inks, the right stock, and multiple hits of white it can work out pretty well, especially if the stock isn’t black or something close to black.

The metallic content (probably aluminum) is far more opaque than any pigment ink, including opaque white. I expect that adding white to the silver would produce an effect like the cards shown above.\n\nThese are definitely letterpress with ink on blue stock. While hot-stamping with foil or film (any Pantone color, in fact) is absolutely opaque (and can be holographic as well!) it's also really plastic looking, at least IMHO. Hot stamping with gold-leaf has a very honorable history, of course, but that's really a different ballpark altogether.\n\nI'll try to get some of my trials up on our flickr page in the next few days...  \nmeanwhile, there's plenty there to browse through!\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfraterdeus/sets/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094553/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/pfraterdeus/sets/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfraterdeus/sets/\")\n\nCheers!  \npeter\n\nslowprint blog: [http://typophile.com/blog/15244](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094553/http:/typophile.com/blog/15244 \"http://typophile.com/blog/15244\")\n\n[http://slowprint.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094553/http:/slowprint.com/ \"http://slowprint.com/\") Letterpress for Typographers!  \n [http://alphabets.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201094553/http:/alphabets.com/ \"http://alphabets.com/\")\n\n"

The primary problem has to do with shortening of serifs as the press approaches Warp One.\n\nHowever, we have developed certain techniques to help overcome this.  \nSan serifs are nonetheless subject to the poorly understood ghost serif problem.\n\nThe most successful types used, of course, are those which have stood the test of time-and-space, typically those which evolved through natural hand-eye-brain interaction, rather than those typically ugly letters created at the drawing board or computer which have nothing whatsoever to do with the human experience of touch or love.
