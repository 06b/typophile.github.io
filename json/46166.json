[Arabic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426000827/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Arabic) has a radically different sript structure - many letters are connected, dots and marks are significant design elements, and there is a lot more variation in the shapes of glyphs within one font. Software like FontLab are geared to Latin fonts for example there is no way to test Arabic using such rules of thumb as the XOX or HOH strategies. You are invited here to share your experience in dealing with these particular aspects of Arabic fonts, with thanks.\n\n",

      "content": "For a typical horizontal Arabic type, I think a similarity of approach between Latin and Arabic can be found in beginning with the spacing of upright letters, i.e. alif and lam. Start with a run of isolated alif glyphs and space them so that the overall colour produced by the rhythmic repetition of black and white is neither too heavy nor too light. In Latin type, one generally starts with letters with strong uprights but also internal white space, such as H and n, but the internal white space of Arabic letters tends to be more variable, so at this initial stage I would work with simple upright forms.\n\nاااااا\n\nOnce the isolated alif has been spaced, this gives you a guide for the left side of the final alif and the right side of the isolated and initial lam. The next step is to space the medial and final form of lam and make the connections of the appropriate length, again using the isolated alifs as a visual guide.\n\nاااللل\n\nThe right side spacing of the medial and final lam provide a guide for the right side of the final alif. You now have a set of guide glyphs between which you can test the spacing of left-right connecting letters, e.g.\n\nااالهاااا\n\nAs with Latin spacing, the more glyph combinations you space, the more pairs you have against which you can check new combinations or refine previous spacing.\n\n"

      "content": "PS. The spacing of a lot of Arabic typefaces is really bad, so trying to find good models can be difficult. We spend a lot of time on spacing (and also kerning of non connecting letters), and I think the Adobe Arabic fonts are worth looking at in this regard.\n\nA major issue re. kerning is interaction between tightly spaced letters and vocalisation marks, which need to be contextually resolved to avoid unwanted collisions. Traditionally, this is done by shifting the marks, rather than by adjusting the spacing of the letters. I think that in a typographical environment, both techniques are valid, and can be used side-by-side and even in combination. However it is done, this is major work and one of the least attractive aspects of the OpenType approach to Arabic.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you John. This is very helpful. Common and sensible advice for spacing Latin is to try to equalize the spaces within the outlines with those between the letters. In other words the line of text should have an even texture and 'color'. This is not always possible in Arabic- for example a downward-curving ra will always leave a void above it, while a tightly knotted initial heh will always look dark however one spaces it.  \nهرانت  \nOf course this effect will vary from font to font, and can be lessened with kerning. But generally-speaking why not simply accept this basic variability in the visual density of a line of Arabic text? Aesthetic and reading comfort considerations aside, this may well prove to be an in-built aid to legibility.\n\n"

      "content": "As I wrote, 'the internal white space of Arabic letters tends to be more variable', so you can't use the internal white space as a guide to inter-letter spacing as one can, to a certain extent, with Latin. This is why I start with the simple upright letters, because they enable one to establish a basic rhythm within which the more complex shapes can be optically spaced. In Latin script there are also letters, such as a and s, that can only be spaced by eye within the general rhythm established by other letters; in Arabic, there are simply more such letters.\n\n"

For example in riq'a scrip the loops of letters like waw, ain, feh and so on are all closed, and a line of such script (or font) will have a rather spindly thorny appearance. On the other hand more geometrical Arabic fonts with strong uprights and horizontal 'spine' will appear more like a compact frieze pattern. I think this is all fine, and other distinguishing patterns and textures will appear in the scripts and fonts of other languages . That is why I am wary of the recent 'matchmaking' trend where Arabic fonts are forced to lose their character by following the x-height and other features of Latin fonts.\n\nHaving said that I feel there must be common guidelines applicable to all fonts in any language- for example a rule of thumb comparing letter width and the space between letter-outlines? The minimum or maximum size of dots and other martks? Human vision is an amazingly sophisticated system, and reading a font is an act of seeing to which the basics of perception must apply whatever is being seen and read.\n\n"

      "content": "Note that when talking about 'spacing' in the context of Arabic, as should be plain from my comment earlier about spacing medial forms between initial lam and final alif, we need to consider both letters with actual space between them, e.g. waw followed by another letter, and also the relationship of connecting letters, i.e. the length of the connecting strokes. In the various classical styles of Arabic writing, these strokes are analysable as part of the fusion, i.e. as part of the letter in its appropriate form in a specific context. The advent of flat 'neo-naskh' and other typographic styles with a horizontal baseline stroke introduces a more Latin-like spacing model, in which the connecting stroke is analysable independently of the letter as a kind of spacing. This is demonstrated in the illustration below, in which we can say that the connecting stroke to the left of the mim is too short, and on the right it may be too long, i.e. that it is spaced too far to the left between the two upright letters. This could be a fault in the mim glyph, in the final alif glyph, in the initial lam, or any combination of the three.

The figure above (using Segoe UI and some fun with Gimp) can be used to point out various aspects of spacing.\n\nThe colored areas are what I have been calling 'word shape' (perhaps another term is used in typography courses?). This shape is defined both by the letter outlines and the spaces between them. Arabic word shapes are irregular as compared to those of Latin, and arguably this helps legibility in Arabic because each word looks different than the other (an advantage erased by 'matchmaking').\n\nReferring to the numbers in the figure I propose to use the term 'space' for 1,2,4,5 defined by the distance between the edge of the letter and the left or right sidebearings. Perhaps 'baseline distance' would be a good term for the distances defined by the length of the baseline in connected letters, such as in 3 (lam and meem). A 'gap' would be the visual space such as 3 or 8 that is defined by the word-shape and it depends on the design of the letters, the baseline distances and spaces involved.\n\n-In this font the spaces 1 , 2 and 7 are all different I wonder if this is intentional?  \n-The gap 3 will be large even if the baseline distances are tightened to the extreme.  \n-The space 5 is unavoidable in most Arabic fonts (if kerning is not used) - is that similar to what Aziz was saying about the dal?  \n-4 and 6 are the only spaces between words here. In the Latin the spaces between the words appear more prominent.  \n-Final letters like the yeh, seen sad etc. leave a large gap such as 8.\n\nIn a good font the careful design of glyphs so that the gaps, spaces and baseline distances all combine to produce a pleasing balance. What would your idea of a 'pleasing balance' be? Examples of 'good' and 'bad' fonts in this respect would be useful for discussion.\n\n"

For example in square kufi where the letter-width is exactly equal to the space between letters, S=1. In the texts above the space between alef and initial yeh (or the dot of the zain and the alef, or the dal and the alef) seem to have a typically minimum space between them.\n\nThen, roughly-speaking, S=2 for the comfortably-spaced top line, S=1 for the middle and S=0.3 for the tightly squeezed bottom example. I guess one can also use other measures for example A/W where A is the average space.\n\n"

Over the centuries Arabic calligraphy has done very well for itself and the results are the fantastic 'polished' styles of classical calligraphy, with all their in-built rules and traditions. Enter printing, and now the calligraphers feel threatened but the font-designers gradually realize that here was a new opportunity to innovate. Because of technical issues like font metrics, the visibility of displayed and printed words font designers have to explore new issues, for example spacing, and find solutions to them.\n\nBy the way the tight spacing Aziz advocates is not a necessarily bad thing. In Chinese and Japanese characters the density of strokes is very high in a given space, but it seems that the eye can read such character-words at one glance. The Arabic equivelant to these characters would be, for example, the basmala ligature. Perhaps with such software as Tom Milo's Tasmeem where such overlapping of glyphs is possible and easy to control, old and new styles of 'tight' Arabic can be displayed.\n\n"

In other word: I agree with the question put by Vladimir, where is the beef? Tell us more.\n\nAs for Tasmeem:\n\nIn defense of Milo's fascinating work, he has produced a \\*working\\* Arabic engine that can work as a desktop publishing software to print involved texts like historical works, complete with few involved and high end fonts. Tasmeem is not a common commercial application like MS-Word targeting the general audience ... at least not yet. One can agree with some of your points and disagree with others, but you have to keep in mind what Tasmeem is really targeting. Personally, I like to see Open Type flourishing for Arabic. I do not like to think of Decotype format as a replacement for it.\n\n-Saad\n\n"

Once the user has access to both, either can be used according to availability, the level of control needed and platform used. As in Latin fonts there is always room for excellence, and healthy competition can benefit typography as a whole.\n\nAs I understand it Aziz has made an incredible labor of love to create a unique font family (Wurud??) TTF (or OT?) with artistry and precision. Let us call it a full-course naskh meal by a master chef. We look forward to the feast.\n\nTom's Tasmeem work is an incredible labor of love consisting of the scholarly analysis of the roots of what he calls the grammar (the visual language) of Arabic writing systems and naskh in particular. This has been ingeniously implemented by the decotype team in software where such writing can be re-created naturally on the computer. In Tasmeem's naskh the user can control spacing and choose the details of various letters and markings. This flexibility applies to any other font adapted for the system, where it can be fine-tuned according to need or level of design experience. One might say Tom makes available a gleaming futuristic kitchen; and (as soon as any techno-phobia has had a chance to wear off) guides us to effortlessly create a superb meal to taste.\n\nAziz gives flowers. Tom gives magic tulip bulbs to instantly grow your own.\n\n"

I love cooking, you could guess as you caught me the other day baking a loaf of bread and one day I hope to present you my version of felafel!\n\nBut after some soul searching, I had to come to the conclusion that I am more of model builder where Arabic is concerned. Models you normally make from fascinating objects like intriguing cars or famous airplanes. Grammars are models of languages - mental exercises driven by fascination and curiosity, attempting structurally to understand and reproduce what can be observed. The object of analysis itself, language, is is taught by examples and learned by imitating. I felt that Arabic script should be approached from the same point of view: not as a capricious art-form irreverently called AC, but as a communication system where senders and receivers over a period of many centuries successfully shared the code. In this approach historical Arabic script is understood as a tool for text manufacture with not so much learnability, but legibility as its primary characteristic.\n\nAzizi Aziz,\n\nLemme try to clarify what that implies.\n\nNaskh is a historical script style. We made a computer model of it. That's all.\n\nDecoType ACE is technology to make this possible (which incidentally was the proof of concept for OpenType). It is not naskh, but a programming environment we (for I am not doing this alone) developed over the years for projects like a naskh model - the ultimate challenge.\n\nTasmeem is Adobe In Design with ACE built into it by WinSoft, who, together with DecoType, designed a User Interface around ACE. With ACE, Tasmeem can handle any Arabic script style.\n\nACE was first conceived as early as 1982-83 to enable the creation of a ruq`a replica. As said, the result was not so much a font, but a computer model of ruq' a. It was licensed by Microsoft around 1993. It was Microsoft who asked us to do a naskh with the same method in 1995. But not after they had first asked us in 1991-92 to provide a realistic naskh solution within their very simple design template - but I suppose that's more a topic for the other thread.\n\nInDesign is a typesetter's tool with enormous precision and many specialized controls - for Latin-based scripts. Some people just want it like that. With Tasmeem, we try to introduce this kind of precision into the field of Arabic script.\n\nAgainst this background, Tasmeem provides the user with tools to adjust the positioning of points and vowels. And, it provides specialized kerning and tracking controls based on the structure of Arabic - which is I believe the subject of this thread.\n\nTom's Tasmeem (nice alliteration, but it is really WinSoft's) and Aziz’ Open Type naskh are sooner complementary than mutually exclusive.\n\nEach is in it's own league.\n\nBulbs,\n\nt\n\nThomas Milo  \nDecoType  \n [www.decotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426000827/http:/www.decotype.com/ \"www.decotype.com\")\n\n"

(By the analysis of this style he arrived at the technology, but in the end the technology is suited for any other style too.) To my amusement or regret (depends on my mood) this provoked some critics to blame him for propagating this particular style which they consider outdated — and disregard the layout engine because of the style of the typeface used for presentations!
