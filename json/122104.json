  "content": "I continued working on this handwritten typeface and while I made alternates to replace double vowels before, I would prefer to replace both vowels individually.\n\nSo, right now I have the following feature:  \nsub a a by a\\_a;\n\n/a\\_a features two variants on /a that are both different from the default /a. Essentially what I want to do is replace /a /a by /a.alt1 and /a.alt2 instead of /a\\_a, because I want to maintain the ability to apply tracking to all the letters.\n\nNow, I actually have this feature working with the following code:  \nsub a' a by a.alt1;  \nsub a.alt1 a' by a.alt2;\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to be the most beautiful solution and I'm not sure if there are instances where this feature won't work appropriately. Is there a better solution than this? Can it be done with only one line?\n\n",

I did a connecting script this year and discovered just how much feature code won't do in certain situations. To me that's a real shortcoming since connecting scripts with alternates have been around for well over a hundred years.\n\n"
