See attached image for comparsion, the glyph widths of your sample matches Caslon 540.\n\nIf you’re looking for an exact match, I think you’re out of luck. I think Big Caslon would be a great alternative if you’re after a Caslon for display. But if you need to match the width of the glyphs exactly, I’d go with Caslon 540.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070806223904im_/http:/typophile.com/files/casloncomp1.png)\n  \n\\* The hairlines appear to be thinner but this could be attributed to the pixel-faires but the numeral 4 is distinctive in your sample.\n"
