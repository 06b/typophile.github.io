  "content": "Hey all,\n\nI am mainly a Production Artist, but I have a client who has asked me to come up for a new logo for her homeowners association. Logos are NOT my forte and I actually cringe when someone asks me to do one. I always try to give it a shot though.\n\nA little background:  \n\\* they currently use 2 logos - one is a flower pot and the other is a phoenix. they hate both  \n\\* the history is that the neighborhood came together to help each other after a 1991 firestorm  \n\\* they are actively involved in the community  \n\\* they want something 1C, simple and stylish\n\nThe top 5 logos are what I have submitted so far and have been rejected. The bottom two are ones I am working on... their feedback from the top logos was:\n\nan image with hills and the rest using NHPA  \nuse NHPA in some creative way  \ndo the image in medium or dark green\n\nAny feedback help anyone can give is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907160442im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/nhpa_logo_4466.jpg)\n\n [‹ Magazine Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907160442/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44825 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [logo for furniture designer ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907160442/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44613 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
