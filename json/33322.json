  "content": "Hi folks.\n\nI'm working at a project to make OpenType(CFF) fonts in FontLabStudio5.  \nI made a Multiple Master font(1 axis) to make a weight family.  \nEach master needed to have a differense positioning value (ex. valt or palt),  \nbut I didn't know how to input positioning value to each master.  \nHow do I input these values to each master?  \nEven if I can input these values into it, how can I get medium positioning value of two masters?  \nI want to get these values automatically just like the kerning values.  \nDoes anyone know the clue?\n\nBest regards.\n\n",
