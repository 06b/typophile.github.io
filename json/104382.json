It is used on the cover for the first couple of novels in the Twenty Palaces series by Harry Connolly.\n\nNeither WhatTheFont nor Identifont yielded any results, so I am hoping that someone here has seen this font before or can help me identify it.\n\nThanks either way!\n\n- Robert\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018083320im_/http:/farm5.static.flickr.com/4032/4257904825_e06893bce7_m.jpg) Cover - Game of Cages\n\n",
