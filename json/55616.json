I'm doing a poster for my typography class and just want as much feedback as possible. Rules of the project are as follows.. Black and white only (or shades of grey) Content is fixed, and must include all of it in the poster. Shapes are allowed. We are going through learning the different systems and this week's is dilational. If I forgot anything, let me know :) Slam it, please. It's far from perfect.\n\n[http://img10.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dilational8.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724161830/http:/img10.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dilational8.jpg \"http://img10.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dilational8.jpg\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724161830im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dilational8_6432.jpg)\n\n",
