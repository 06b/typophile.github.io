Most designers are busy spending the majority of their time on client work, so putting together a design for Typophile requires some extra time somewhere.

All of these (including professional practice) are acts of collaboration (i.e. the sharing of knowledge and ideas). Does the fact that I am financially compensated for these efforts make me selfish? Any reasonable person would agree that it does not. Hopefully you will too.   \n   \nFurther, you can't possibly presume to know people's motivations for submitting later rather than sooner. As Jared and Armin have both pointed out, it's more a function of procrastination than anything. To say that 50% of us are weasels is arbitrary and ill-considered.   \n   \nAnd rude.   \n   \nLike many, it now seems, I submitted my entries in the waning days of the entry period not to keep them secret, but because that's when I had time to do so. That's the whole idea behind a 30-day submission window.

Simply it takes away from any ego-mania and gives chance to those last minute submissions to be absorbed into the collective for inspiration and thought on their own designs. people can tailor, revise, re-organize concepts - (\\*and only those concept #'s submitted\\*)   \n   \n2. Proper collaboration (not pure competition) and everyone gets an overall look at the scope of work and can judge best themselves, and/or all together, where excatly the cream rises - and work on a few specifically through comment - while watching a slew of \"revisions\" go up based on feedback where all entries are up.   \n   \nI suspect as it is now, that those last minute designs are probably completed by those who are most confident in their metier. perhaps in order to push the envelop, those who are less familiar with the elements of design/application/language/what-have-you, they can learn from those entries which are submitted last minute a.k.a those with too much work,clients,ect. on their hands to not share their vision earlier.   \n   \nhmm I didn't explain that well - but I'm sure you guys get it. like round 2 of the process...y'no when the client picks from the comps, narrows it down but says change these 3 all up and givem back I'll pick 1.\n\n"
