They use individual fonts for each feature and the magazine is award winning. Could you also tell me what sort of homes stuff, what market it is. Is it: softer warm inviting or more hard edge cutting edge modern design futuristic.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDan\n\n"

Faces such as The Sans, Frutiger or Syntax fit the category.\n\nI think that you can choose a sturdy and common body face as long as you use it on an edgy way instead of torturing the reader with a funky copy face.\n\nMaybe FF Bau as a reference to Helvetica and Atma for copy. Maybe it’s too safe and you want something more edgy. I tought also of FF Bastille.\n\nHéctor\n\n"
