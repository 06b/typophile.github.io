I agree with you again (I agreed also with the issue of visual pollution etc..on the other thread btw) but since I am not Brazilian I feel bad about dissing the country I am living in...  \nIf you had said something similar about the US (and I think Bush certainly deserves the same treatment you gave Lula) you would have immediately people at your throat calling you anti-american and blah blah blah...if you know what I mean.  \nAnyway, talk about waste of money...you probably know the marca brasil. Also tons of money ( and I mean a ridiculous amount of money considering the much more urgent issues) involved in a survey to find out how people see Brazil...the author of marca brasil told me the survey involved asking half the planet what do they think when you say Brazil. Then they picked only the positive things, right? Cheerful, sunny etc etc. so I imagine they had to descard all references on violence, pollution. poverty etc since it would not have any use for the logo anyway. Do you follow me? So why bother asking if then you take only what you want to hear. Now that is a bloody waste of money if I have ever seen one.\n\nThe marca Brazil for those who don't know, it's used to identify products made in Brazil for export. I am not criticising the thing in itself just the waste of public money for the survey. Just give the designer a brief for fcks' sake and take it from there!\n\n"
