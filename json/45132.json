As I have used it more and more I have come to notice there is not a single curve out of place—I happen to think it’s perfectly harmonious.\n\nThere are not too many Bodoni/Figgins interpretations that are as good. The only one I can think of is not released just yet:\n\n[http://www.christianschwartz.com/brunel.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924161634/http:/www.christianschwartz.com/brunel.shtml \"http://www.christianschwartz.com/brunel.shtml\")\n\nAlso here is a script I use to test the kerning in the fonts I own—here; set in Big Figgins Roman:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924161634im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/figgins_4994.png)\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"
