The only problem is that I can’t seem to turn my lower-case “p” into a question mark without losing the awesome sci-fi retro curves of Magistral Extra Bold OT. The standard ? that is part of the character set is no help as it in turn looks nothing like a “p”.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013111129im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/knownspace_6199.png)\n\nTerrible attempts at conversion (and the original ?)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013111129im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/knownspace2_6333.png)\n\nAny ideas?
