They all are in relationship to the center (the city), their farmers bring their products to the city’s markets and buy whatever in the cities.\n\nMilitary-based “Hinterland” is the area behind “The Front”, where e.g. in WW1 all wounded soldiers came first to be taken care of, ammunition-magazines and so on.\n\nIn West-Berlin the problem was, that there was only a “Hinterland” from the communist site, but not from the West-Berlin site. There was the city with the wall around it.  \nCrazy times... and the communist custums was not joking.\n\nGeorg\n\n"
