Look how nice it looks in riccard0's screenshot! So clear.\n\nIt was so very evil of you to link to a thread illustrating my apparent rudeness. If you were so polite, why did you do it?

I sought out another reference sample of the book, and ran that to get a match.\n\nJust compare it to my screen caps of Formata to see the difference.\n\nAnd, no, I'm not projecting anything. Your written communication could stand to be less terse—I'm not the only person who finds it rude.\n\n"
