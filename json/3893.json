(Please don't ask \"why TrueType?\"; it's a long story) We have not had any problem with the font until last week, when a client w/ a canon printer using a Fiery RIP started choking on it.   \n   \nPDFs using the font would work fine; PS files using the font would not.   \n   \nAny ideas about how to fix this, or suggestions as to the best place to look for answers?   \n   \nThanks very much.   \n   \nJay\n\n",

A fiery rip is newer technology based on postscript protocols, of which TT has none.   \n   \nAnother quick fix might be to drop your TT font into Fontographer and recreate it as a PS font :-) but if you wanted it TT, I suppose, it would be so already.   \n   \nGood luck.\n\n"
