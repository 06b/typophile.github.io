My first thought was Stag, but remarkably enough, the magazine actually mentioned the new type on the index page. “About the Type: In this issue we introduce a new typeface for use in headlines, subheads and captions. It’s called Sunday. Commissioned by The New York Times Magazine for our exclusive use, Sunday was drawn by the type designers Eric Olson and Nicole Dotin of the Process Type Foundry.”\n\nIt’s used all over the cover and throughout, but I don’t have a scanner available right now to demonstrate. It’s looking great, maybe a bit like Stag Sans mixing with Klavika’s squareness.\n\n"
