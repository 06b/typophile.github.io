I was not able to find a font that came close enough for my taste, so I'm attempting to mimic the script. I don't have any experience lettering so let me know what you think. The Headline Reads\n\nThe Bank  \nThat Deserves A  \nBail Out.\n\nI wanted to wait for some opinions before I started the T so I used commercial script as a place holder\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [thebankcampbells.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417193517/http:/typophile.com/files/thebankcampbells.jpg) | 152.33 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Super headline. Is this one of a series? If so what are the other lines? (there's probably a TARP line to be discovered)\n\nThe h-e combo is a bit awkward since the original e is a result of the high join with the b. But I wouldn't worry about it since it's a campbell's distinctive.  \nRather than set the whole headline in Campbell's script, consider using all the type on the can (you may already be doing this).  \nEg:  \n\"Campbells\" =\\> The Bank  \n\"CONDENSED\" =\\> THAT DESERVES  \n\"Cream of Mushroom =\\> A Bail Out\n\nDon't forget to show us the final result.\n\nRandy\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the good suggestions. Because my deadline was the 10th I didn't change much on the type, but I do think I will ditch the high join on the h-e like was suggested and try one where they are connected at the bottom.\n\nRandy: it's not a series right now but I could see it a couple of ways it could be. Glad to see we were on the same page about using the same type as on the can. I omitted the SOUP face because it would have been clunky.\n\nHere it is, besides the h-e which I plan to fix, let me know what you think. Suggestions for the T?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417193517im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AustinFoodBank_3827.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "I think the stem and crossbar of the T should be joined. That would start making it match the B better. If you want to go further perhaps try making the crossbar a bit longer on the right side so it is over the h more, and think about the relationship between it and the angle of the top of B.\n\nNice work. Have you tried printing the label and photographing it around an actual can? A whole stack of these would look great especially if a few were slightly dented.\n\n"
