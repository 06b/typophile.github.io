  "content": "Maybe someone can appreciate my disgust when I got into a 2006 CLS (attached) the other day, to find Arial on the gearknob. I found the same usage on the E500. Both of these cars are top of the line luxury cars.\n\nI'm not a fan of Arial, but I'm even less tolerant when it is used instead of a typeface that formed part of an original design. I feel so strongly that I sent letters explaining my concern to various Mercedes-Benz/Daimler-Chrysler offices and I haven't had a response yet. Do you think they care?\n\nLook at the comparison, correct Merc typeface left, right is A (as seen in these models.)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120309052744im_/http:/typophile.com/files/merc5_5361.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [merc1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120309052744/http:/typophile.com/files/merc1.jpg) | 20.21 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "You can't help but wonder how this kind of thing could happen...  \nWorking as a desktop publisher, I've seen my share of wrong type usage & in 6 years I've only had one (!) housestyle instruction list sent along with the logo (this was for a big bank in Belgium that even has 2 different logo's; one to use if it ends up getting smaller than 2cm wide (if I remember correctly) & another to use otherwise). The instruction list for correct usage of the logo was over 3 pages, but even having used this logo practically daily, I've only seen it once. Another horrible example is -also from a (big) bank- who sent along an advertisement we had to remake with the wrong type. I was very tempted to correct this, but after adressing my boss, I still had to use the wrong logo. It was a pretty obvious wrong logo as well... In case of a bank that is often run on \"independent\" terms, I can somewhat understand how this kind of thing could happen, but as for your Mercedes example, I just don't see hòw it could've happened. It's an unforgivable mistake! Get a BMW just in spite ;-)\n\n"
