I have designed the type myself and I'm expecting you all to say bad things, but it is the first time I have designed type like this so I would love some constructive criticism.\n\nFire away!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [untitled.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108210922/http:/typophile.com/files/untitled.JPG) | 16.45 KB |\n\n",

What does the lettering look like in positive (black on white background) – is it strong enough to stand on it's own as a device?  \nBecause  \n2. Why is the proportion of that enclosing leaf shape so large? If you take that backgound shape away, or make it radically smaller, what happens then?\n\nGood luck with it.\n\n"

You could use Verve and change the dot in the \"i\" to be like the dot in the other.\n\nYour logo will not work at small sizes because The type is sized so small in the shape that when the shape is made small the type will be MUCH smaller. The large shape doesn't do anything for me. If you use it make it smaller and strategically placed.\n\n"

Imagine this on a label: the actual name is going to very tiny if it is locked into this shape.\n\nIf they're a new company, you really want to maximise the visibility and consistency of the name if you're going to build awareness.\n\n"
