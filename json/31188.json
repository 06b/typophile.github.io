  "content": "Hi all,  \n It’s possible this has been discussed before, but my search of poster with any of the above words came up empty. Long story short, I have a couple of posters I’d like to display. They weren’t terribly expensive, though one or two are limited printings, and in general I’d prefer not to do anything permanent to them (i.e. mount to foamcore, etc.). One of them is printed edge-to-edge, making framing a bit difficult. I’d rather not pay to have them professionally framed, as this would cost orders of magnitude more than they cost. My current favorite idea is to place them between sheets of lexan or glass and use binder clips to hold the sandwich together. My main concern with this is moisture, if the posters absorb too much they could end up sticking to the glass. You guys must have posters, any interesting methods for their display? One neat idea I came across was magnetic paint, paint a section of wall with it and use magnets to hold the posters up, but I’m unsure. Any ideas, suggestions, assuagements would be greatly helpful.  \nThanks!\n\n",

You need at LEAST 3 coats to get even the lightest of plastic magnets to stick…don’t even think of getting a poster to stick up there.\n\nAn ingenious way to hang a poster (albeit unprotected):\n\n[http://posterhanger.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070217102033/http:/posterhanger.com/)\n\n"
