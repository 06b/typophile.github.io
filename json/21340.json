  "content": "Hi Typophiles,  \nHere is a random question about Business card sizes. I got a hold of a couple BC’s of random sizes. Although I heard it’s best to stick to the common (3.5 x 2 in) just because it fits BC’s cards binders and such, I found some other sizes interesting. I don’t think going longer than 3.5 in is functional but shorter than 2 in looks nice. I found some specs [online](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516113241/http:/www.clickbusinesscards.com/faq/cards_cut_smaller.html) about sizes and said they could make height shorter than (in metric system) 53mm and showed a 89mm by 45mm card, I like that size but is there really another standard size besides 3.5 x 2 in? What are the pros and cons?\n\nHere are some size examples I found:  \n• WeWorkForThem ---\\> 3.75 x 1.75 in (too long and doesn’t fit BC holder)  \n• Alterpop ---\\> 3.5 x 1.60 in (maybe a bit too short)  \n• w.e.a clothing for children ---\\> 3.5 x 1.5 in (way too short in my opinion)  \n• Sequence ---\\> the closest measure to this BC was on my pica ruler 21p3 x 10p6 (about 3.5 x 1.75 in) in my opinion the most comfortable size.\n\nThanks,  \nkco\n\n",

The boss was very impressed, but a few days later realized the card was useless as he couldn't file it. He wrote the information on the back of one of his cards.\n\nKinda makes the original one worthless.\n\nThe only larger cards that can be useful are ones that fold to the regular size, and then the important information all has to be on one side, so it can be inserted in a card sleeve folded so the info shows.\n\n"
