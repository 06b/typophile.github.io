  "content": "Happy Spring!\n\nJust like an explosion of Spring flowers comin' up from 'neath the soil, we've got a whole mess of fantastic and BRAND NEW FONTS for you and a NEW FOUNDRY!\n\nThe Font Bros are pleased to announce the addition of Alison Argento's Dear Alison font foundry, a tribute to handwritten correspondance styles we're sure you'll love!\n\nDear Allison - Gladly Mailed is a cursive handwritten font inspired by old correspondence. It has been built in OpenType format and includes custom letter pairs to swap double capitals, double lowercase, and double number pairs with custom ligature variations as you type to create a more randomized look. Check it out at: [http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=DEAL-GLMA](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015234122/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=DEAL-GLMA \"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=DEAL-GLMA\")\n\nDear Allison - Smiley is a spunky little sign-painteresque font, ideal for childrens books, posters, etc. Check out this fun number at: [http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=DEAL-SMIL](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015234122/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=DEAL-SMIL \"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=DEAL-SMIL\")\n\nCBDO - Louisiana originated from the lovely handwriting style of Melanie Snedeker. Lettering Artist Charles Borges de Oliveira then refined the letter forms to produce this one of a kind handwriting script. When you need a legible handwriting font, Louisiana is the perfect choice. Check it out at: [http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=CBDO-LOUI](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015234122/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=CBDO-LOUI \"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=CBDO-LOUI\")\n\nOutside the Line - Dearest John is the first font in the Love Letters series from Outside the Line. It is a bouncy hand lettered font. If you type caps and lower case you get one look. If you type all caps you get another look. Kind of 2 fonts for the price of one. Check it out at: [http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=OUTL-DEJO](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015234122/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=OUTL-DEJO \"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=OUTL-DEJO\")\n\nHarold's Fonts - This month must be super special as Harold unleashes not one but TWO NEW MONOGRAM FONTS!
