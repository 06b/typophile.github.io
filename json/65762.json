The one you posted has a nice contrast between #1 and #2 (where the «doubling» is quite obvious), but between #2 and #3 the overall shape changes so much that it could almost be another character altogether (especially at the tiny sizes that this thing is going to be used in). Dunno.  \nOn the other hand, yours nicely works the middle ground between the dagger and the asterisk! :-)\n\n"
