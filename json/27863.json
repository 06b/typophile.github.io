This assumes you are using InDesign CS2.\n\n"

Nick thanks for the suggestion to use a different font, right now im using 36pt size full stops from Helvetica rounded, i still have to place the circles on a horizontal axis because i dont know how to use negative tracking (putting the circles to the left of the text frame, so they appear to be out of fram) but the pre set leading helps a lot thanks.\n\n"
