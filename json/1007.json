Now, anyone familiar with 60s TV kitsch will recognize from [whence](http://web.archive.org/web/20131202023634/http:/www.timvp.com/beverlyh.html) they came.   \n   \nIf I were to market these together in a package, does anyone foresee a phone call from the CBS legal department in my future?   \n   \nIf so, I'd rather avoid such a headache and simply re-name the fonts.   \n   \nOn a side note: Has anyone here ever named and released a font only to discover that name in use by another font?\n\n",
