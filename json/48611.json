  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am working on a logo type for a new product company that could use some feedback. It is partnered with a mark that I am not including since the type should stand on its own as well. The idea is to partner soft curves with hard functional lines and have both interesting positive and negative space.\n\nSince I tweaked and made some of the individual letters, I want to be certain that things feel balanced and not like a random collection of different fonts. Kerning issues and the like are still being resolved too. Other suggestions for sprucing/sexing it up or whatever are also appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance,  \nAnjel\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045703im_/http:/typophile.com/files/waterbox_5413.png)\n\n [‹ What do you think?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045703/http:/typophile.com/node/49487 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Overton's re-branding ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045703/http:/typophile.com/node/49148 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Even though you want the logotype to stand on its own, the letterforms must still be sympathetic to the symbol. So, it’s hard to judge it true effectiveness without seeing it as a whole.\n\nRegarding the letters themselves: the crossbar on the A seems too high and the X is too wide. The left and right half of the X should overlap, not just barely meet. I think the W might be a touch too wide as well.\n\n"

Another idea for the X would be to turn a + symbol if you’re going for a handmade character appeal.\n\nYou might also try adding a thin stroked box around the type to further iterate the ’box’ theme.\n\nSee below.\n\nI do rather fancy the boxy look and the subtle gray color though. Nice start.\n\nThe font in these is Gotham HTF Medium weight and I rotated the + symbol 45°.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045703im_/http:/typophile.com/files/waterbox_3968.jpg)\n\n"
