The only other likely source is Veer, which I will check next.\n\nAny information about what this is from, and how old it is? If it's commercial, I suppose it could be a custom font design.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Either their keywords are not helpful, or they just don't have it.\n\nIf you just need something similar it seemed that [Corradine Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419133946/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/corradine+fonts/fonts/?refby=bowfin) had a few with a similar 'untrained' script look. Especially Prissa, Rapidda, Helga and Corradine Handwriting.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
