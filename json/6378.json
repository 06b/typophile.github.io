  "content": "Hi there,   \n   \nI was a couple of days puzzle with a problem generating   \nfonts in Fontlab. I believe that isn't weel explained   \nin the FL manual.   \n   \nIf I generate a PS1 mac font having the encondings   \nselected in \"Names\" mode (and Macintosh Roman)) the   \nresulting font doesn't have well arranged all the   \ncharacters: for example, the greek symbols and so on   \n(only are OK the basic alphabetic symbols, A-Z a-z and   \nmarks, etc).   \n   \nThat was bothering me a lot, cause I wanted to put some   \nligatures in the place of some greek letters (and appel   \nsymbol)... When I tried doing it with the old good Fog   \nand choosing Mac encoding, the font worked well...   \n   \nIn the begining I thought that the problem was the   \n'Export prefereces' selection and I made tests using   \nevery option there ('Select enconding automatically'   \nand so on).   \n   \nIt took me a lot of time to realize that for having the   \nbasic PS1 mac font well done, at the moment of   \ngenerating the font in FL \\*the CODEPAGE MODE have to be   \nselected\\* (in Mac OS Roman, of course).   \n   \nI din't find another way to get a proper PS1 font for   \nMac. I don't know if I'm doing the things correctly,   \nbut for the moment it works.   \n   \nAny comment? Anyone with the same problem?   \n   \nThanks in advance.   \n   \nRamiro E.\n\n",
