Napoleon did a big PR tour that wound through Egypt where his archaeological team picked up and deciphered the Rosetta stone, which lead to a huge boom in Egyptology. At the time Egyptology was funded primarily via tomb robbing, so Britain was overwhelmed with looted Egyptian artifacts, sort of like Banshees albums in the 1980s. Slab serifs came and went along with the trend of propping a mummy up in the corner of one's dining room; and so the two are inextricably linked.\n\n"

      "content": "Why slab?\n\nSlabs serif faces were more often referred to as \"Antique\" in type specimens of the early 19th century.\n\nThe first sans serif type was published in a Caslon specimen of 1816 (there are no extant examples of it in use), and named \"Egyptian\".\n\nIn applying the term \"Egyptian\" to a sans serif, at first, there may have been the association with something ancient and primitive -- this is James Mosley's thesis for the cultural space the sans came from, as told in \"The Nymph and the Grot\".\n\nUpdike (Printing Types, Volume II), mentions in an anecdotal footnote that in a \"London Jest Book\" of 1806 (unfortunately, an internet-quality reference...) there is a joke about an Irishman's reaction to a \"Fashionable Egyptian Sign Board\". There is no way of knowing wheher the lettering thereon, in which the \"thin strokes were as thick as the thick strokes\" was a sans or slab. Anyway, the signpainters were ahead of the typefounders.\n\nUpdike conjectured that there was some racial correspondence between the dark weight of the style and the Egyptian term, however, this was probably the influence on him of a later 19th century concept, encapsulated in the term from the title of the explorer Stanley's book \"The Dark Continent\", dark meaning undiscovered, unilluminated by civilization, and with dark-skinned inhabitants. However, even then this racist premise was often understood to refer to sub-Saharan Africa, not Egypt and the northern Arab territories.\n\nThere were in fact quite a few Egyptians in Paris in Napoleon's day -- they were Mamelukes, a caucasian ethnic group, originally abducted to Egypt as slaves, but who had become its rulers. Many of them, male citizens of the Ottoman Empire, made their way to France with the returning French army, and subsequently formed a divsion in Napoleon's army, featuring prominently in military parades, their exotic uniforms creating a fashion craze. Girodet, a leading painter of the time, was fascinated by the Orient and had several of them living in his house -- he did a series of portraits of them, and used his guests to populate his large painting \"The Revolt of Cairo\". So in France at least, the Egyptian phenomenon was all about the exotic novelty of the Orient. And French fashions quickly crossed the Channel to London.\n\nSo I'm sticking with the theory that while there may be several contributing factors to the Egyptian name, really it's just something that was trendy at the time, taken up by type founders because it looks cool in print (to typophiles) -- the only word with three different consecutive letters with lower-case descenders. Eventually, it settled on the slab-serif genre.\n\nBear in mind that, as Alastair Johnston explained in \"Alphabets to Order\", the people responsible for 19th century specimen books were dada poets.\n\n"

Well, at least you inadvertently pointed to where you stole the image from._\n\nActually, I first came across it in another book, \"London, A Great City\" published by the Folio Society. Is scanning an image from a book and posting it on a web forum considered theft? I suppose I should have asked the Alfred Dunhill Museum for permission to reproduce their painting, but in reproducing low-res scans to illustrate a point in an online thread, I don't think people usually go to that length, so I'm just following general practice. Or do you think one should do better?\n\n_By the way, printers’ ink balls._\n\nGosh.\n\nSpeaking of Mr Johnston's book, I came across this quote in it, from Richard Austin's \"Address to Printers\", 1819, concerning the problems with the ultra fine details of modern type, \"Besides this, in the drawing of the letters, the true shape and beauty are lost; and instead of consisting of circles, and arcs of circles, so agreeable to the eye, some of them have more the appearance of Egyptian characters than good roman letter.\"\n\nWhere did type founders of Austin's day get their knowledge of what an Egyptian character looked like? I would guess from Edmund Fry's \"Pantographia\", published in 1799 if I recall correctly, which attempted to show all the alphabets used by all languages around the world. So I wonder what the page(s) on Egyptian type look like in Fry's book?\n\n_slab serif and egyptian are synonyms,_\n\nThat's always beeen my understanding. I named my slab-serif take on Bodoni \"Egyptian\" partly for that reason, as well as others, but most logically because the serifs don't look at all like slabs in the Light and Thin weights.\n\nBut for encompassing a variety of typefaces, rather than weights, \"Slab\" is more practical, which is no doubt why the FontBook uses it as a category, to include many hefty-serifed faces (eg for news text) that are not at all \"Egyptian\".\n\n"

He was supposed to give a talk at the St Bride conference in 2004 about his research, but he was ill that day. A few weeks before his death, when he was still curator at the Type Museum in London, I visited the Type Museum. In the generous manner that was typical of him, he gave me a short presentation about the talk he wanted to give at St Bride – essentially the same information that you published now on your blog. Of course, in my stupidity, I didn’t write anything down, and when he died, I already thought this information was lost forever. Justin had also prepared some new illustrations for his talk which he showed me on his power book.

F. Johnson, who dated the Figgins slab-serif 1815 (which is on the title page of the specimen) and the Caslon sanserif 1816. Therefore... But it helps to get outside the typefoundry and to look around a bit.\n\nOne of my favourite images is this one (which I put in the original Nymph & Grot), published in 1808, a project for a vast pyramid outside Portsmouth, the Royal Navy base, to commemorate Nelson at Trafalgar and Stuart at Maida (no, I had never heard of him either – but there is Maida Vale in London as well as Trafalgar Square). The pyramid makes an Egyptian connection, but the lettering was described as 'the earliest form of Roman character'.\n\nI'm sorry this one never got built – but there are plenty of other examples of sanserifs before 1816, ususally conveying some idea of an early and 'primitive' form. Not unrelated to Tschichold's idea of the Grotesk as pure and basic, in some ways.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150228182533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Wood%20-%20Pyramid_4860.jpg)\n\n"
