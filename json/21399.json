      "content": "Alas, none of the digital Coptic fonts I have looked at have been of very good design quality. I presume you've seen the various free ones available at e.g. [http://www.travelphrases.info/gallery/Fonts\\_Coptic.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809205150/http:/www.travelphrases.info/gallery/Fonts_Coptic.html \"http://www.travelphrases.info/gallery/Fonts\\_Coptic.html\")\n\nCoptic is on the list of scripts to be supported by the SBL Font Foundation, which means I hope have the pleasure of designing two Coptic fonts (one Sahidic, one Bohairic) in the next couple of years, but I presume your need is more immediate.\n\n"
