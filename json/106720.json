  "content": "Hi,\n\nIs there a way to see how a .ttf file is going to render in different browsers on different operating systems, without having to actually view it on multiple devices and browsers? The fontsquirrel webfont generator also offers a cleartype png, which is the sort of thing I'm looking for, but it's quite limited. Thanks in advance.\n\nCheers,  \nJasper\n\n",
