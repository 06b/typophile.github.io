      "content": "I reserve the term ‘script’ for typefaces that deliberately mimic handwriting, usually -- but not always -- with connecting letters. Although the Gabriola letters have a lot of flow to them and a distinctive pattern of entry and exit strokes, I think of them as essentially typographic forms, not handwritten ones.\n\nThe ‘Flemish roots’ to which James refers are really a kind of visual inspiration rather than a model for the letterforms. I was inspired by the look of things like this (by the master Jan van de Velde):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043104im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VDV_5728.jpg)\n\nBut both the shape of the letterforms and, crucially, their stroke modelling is very different. The Baroque Flemish writing masters used a broad nib which they rotated to produce a greater variety in the pattern of thick and thin strokes than had previously been done. Gabriola is based around an expansion stroke model, closer to that characteristic of a pointed split nib. I'll be talking about the reasons for this during my lecture at St Bride's later this month. The short reason is that the expansion stroke model is more flexible than the translation or rotation models.\n\n"

With jaggies (ClearType) or only with greyscale antialiasing. Both ways are certainly not the nicest.\n\n\\* By included I mean at least a user preference to turn it on, like it was ClearType in XP. Strictly speaking, it is included in Vista, but it can only be accessed by programs which were written specifically with the setting for this type of rendering.\n\n"

On the other hand, even Microsoft's own major apps, especially Office, seem unlikely to be rewritten or replaced for DWrite/WPF. But perhaps Web browsers and readers are where we will see this stuff implemented first, since something like IE is a much smaller code base than e.g. Word and without the same backwards compatibility issues.\n\n"
