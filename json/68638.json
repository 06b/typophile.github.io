This is very slow and infuriating if your working with large volumes of text.\n\nsee this site for an example of what i mean  \n [http://www.food2.com/recipes](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017161257/http:/www.food2.com/recipes \"http://www.food2.com/recipes\")\n\nIts relatively easy in indesign, just a case of setting an underline with an offset.\n\n",
