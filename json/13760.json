  "content": "I'm looking for a typeface similar to [Corrosion](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011064309/http:/www.houseind.com/include/getimage.php?id=965) by [House Industries](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011064309/http:/typophile.com/wiki/House%20Industries), included in the [Flyer Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011064309/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=13&subpage=viewfonts) collection. I would definately consider purchasing this font if you didn't have to buy the entire collection for $125. The other fonts are pretty rad as well, but I don't have any use for them at the moment. This is for a personal project (website) and $125 is over my budget.\n\nSo pretty much I'm looking for an outlined face that is irregular and maybe even rough... scratchy or carved looking, but not too scribbly or childish looking. Maybe something you might see at Urban Outfitters, but without fake perspective/3-d effect. Commercial or freeware are both fine.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
