      "content": "I'll certainly be recommending WOFF to my customers as a format for use of their custom fonts on the Web. Its a smart format: easy to support, nicely compressed, preserves digital signatures and custom font data, isn't installable as a desktop font.\n\nEOTL (or CWT as we should probably start calling it) is more problematic because in a couple of significant ways @font-face support doesn't really work in Internet Explorer, so the backwards compatibility benefits of the CWT format are hobbled. Some of my customers are commissioning CFF OpenType fonts, so obviously I can't recommend CWT because it is limited to TTF. The style linking bug in Internet Explorer means that web developers will need to hack their way around this, if possible, in their CSS code, and that looks pretty painful to me. So if a customer with a TTF font were specifically needing backwards compatibility on IE, then I'd have to point them at CWT with caveats, but otherwise I'll be putting my energy into pushing MS to support WOFF a.s.a.p.\n\n"

And I, among others, will be all over them about it on the IE Blog and monthly chats and knockin' on SG's door if I have to. ;)  \nI'm familiar with the CSS issues and, as workarounds go, they are just not all that painful. To some, IE can do nothing right and every little thing is a big thing. (Or at least an occasion for a snide comment or two.)  \nIronically, Opera 10's font-linking implementation is - unlike IE - buggy as in quirky and unpredictable. Plus it deviates from the standard in much the same way as IE. But outside of my blog, I've yet to see a word of criticism. And the spin on Opera's development blog makes the workarounds for it sound like best practice! (And the even funnier thing is: it just might be best practice. The web community is still figuring out the most coherent and sensible way to make the CSS work. But until we had real implementations to test against, it was pointless.)  \nAlso, Apple has yet to weigh in on support for WOFF in Safari, and until they do, we're largely on hold.  \nBut it's time to get the conversion tools working, surely. Thanks for the input.\n\n"

The phrase \"licensing for use with WOFF\" suggests that you expect the route to the new world to come via web developers \"rolling their own.\"\n\nI would actually expect that most foundries will choose to license WOFF fonts directly. (No \"for use with\" necessary.)\n\nWhen a new font format gets established and achieves widespread implementation, then foundries will start making fonts in that format and providing them for license. This is what they do -- make fonts, not provide material for users to make their own.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is the licensing and pricing models that will emerge. What will be offered to those who want fonts only for web use? At what price point? What about both print and web versions? What about upgrading from one format to another?\n\nI don't mean to rub you the wrong way with my comment. I agree, this is a potentially significant crossroads. After all the hullabaloo, font producers better get on board quickly and figure out how they want to leverage this development. And they'd better get product to market in a timely fashion.\n\nIs there an estimated timeline for the FF3.6 release?\n\n"

I'm impressed. Again.\n\n@kentlew  \nFirst, my apologies to you, Si, John Hudson, and David Berlow for hijacking thread [Cufon and (c)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123214711/http:/www.typophile.com/node/61804) from a few weeks ago and not following up.  \nI have now read all of your comments three times, bookmarked it for future reference, and have written three drafts in reply - all of which somehow didn't rate, in my mind, clicking submit. A mental block, maybe. Plus I had distractions. And sometimes a blog comment is too confining. Big topic. Lots of grey area. Anyway, we're back to it here. Felt rude, sorry.)\n\n_\"This is what they do [foundries]— make fonts, not provide material for users to make their own.\"_  \nSays who? I think that's a little presumptuous. Each font designer and their agents will decide how they see their role in this brave new world. (Note to self: Stock up on Soma.)  \nSome won't want the headache of providing converted files. And, not too far into the future, some technologies like SVG **demand** extraction of at least some of the data within the font file.  \nBTW - I don't mind at all you getting prickly about it. All the better. To complicate matters further, at the same time we're dealing with these new technologies, we're also dealing with changes in mood, meaning, and perception among those who create and use the web. I don't have to tell you that there are those who quite knowingly will not recognize or respect Intellectual Property rights. And they will not go away. But still, **anyone** understands: \"Hey, I put a lot of work into this thing, and I'd really like to make a few bucks out of it so I can keep on keep doing it.\" Gotta feed the bulldog, as the British expression has it. (But let's not go there here. I'll end up with \"blog post\" traumatic stress, yet again.)\n\n@james puckett  \n_\"I’m sure that Apple will get on board\"_  \nI'm glad _you're_ sure. AFAIK - They have been totally silent and uninvolved in the issue of Web Fonts other than being the first major player to support linking to \"raw\" TTF/OTF files using @font-face in Safari. However, if Webkit follows Mozilla's lead, I am assuming they will incorporate support for WOFF into Safari - all the work will have been done for them. No reason not to, unless we're missing something.\n\n@dan\\_reynolds  \n_\"Will FF3.6 also support EOT Lite?\"_  \nLooks like no. To me it seems clear they're ignoring it, at least for right now. It will soon break out like this: EOT for IE, TTF/OTF or WOFF for Firefox, TTF/OTF for Safari, Opera, and - the mouse that continues to roar - Chrome.\n\n@john hudson  \nI'd be happy to start calling EOTL \"CWT\" except that few will know what I'm referring to and, as you know, there is currently silence from implementors on CWT's status.  \n(Soon, maybe begin calling it _CWT (formerly EOT)_, or somesuch.)\n\n"

The format is also designed to fit pretty seamlessly into automated compiling, customisation and shipping workflows, and as well as serialisation I anticipate things like custom subsetting for customer language requirements.\n\nSure, there are going to be some TTF/OTF licenses that permit you to create WOFF files from desktop fonts, but those are more likely to be free font licenses rather than commercial licenses.\n\n"

That's all. That's all I was talking about.

I shot back that Monotype's EULA doesn't license for it. Sii shot back that this wasn't fair.

They crowd the true picture's details out of your thoughts.\n\nClients are not at all likely to follow the format drama unfolded before us, are they? So **support** of them, by us, means we supply the client's design choice via whatever web font format(s) we need to serve to meet the client's users' UA/OS demands.\n\n**Endorsement** to us means we think that more than one format is good, so we don't do much of that. Clients don't care what we endorse as long as what we support is what they need to meet their users' UA/OS demands.\n\nThe typical web font **license** involves the client's selection of a style, and the coverage they wish for (one browser on one platform, or all browsers on all platforms are the current choices), because that's all they want to license, the style.\n\nThus, we support WOFF, OT and EOTL, endorse only OT, and do not license any of them.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

For a new product to be licensed one needs to establish business and distribution models and make sure that production tools are available and reliable, that quality of products and customer experience is up to established company standards, and that technical support personnel is trained and ready to deal with the demanding customers like yourself.

As I wrote today on the W3C font list, the arguments in favour of CWT (EOTL as was) are market arguments based on the backwards compatibility benefits of the format. If those benefits are considered important by web authors and designers and their clients, then there should be market pressure on both browser makers and font vendors to support CWT, and that pressure may be strong enough to overcome the political and technical baggage of the EOT-derived format. But given that the technical baggage includes the fact that CFF OpenType fonts are excluded from the backwards compatibility benefits, the market pressure would need to be substantial to interest a lot of font vendors.\n\nWOFF is in a bit of a different situation, in that it has been developed collaboratively and specifically with a web font standardisation process in mind, not a market driven process. Unlike either CWT or naked font linking, WOFF is uncontentious and doesn't come with any baggage attached, so provides a good basis for consensus and voluntary interoperability.\n\n"

I've made my recommendation, which is that the OS/2 embedding bits be completely ignored for web font purposes, and that this made clear in the WOFF and CWT specs. This is what Firefox and Opera are already doing when serving naked fonts, so it shouldn't make any difference if the same fonts are in a wrapper format.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to see the meanings of ‘embedded', ‘embeddable', ‘linked' and ‘linkable’ given clear, unambiguous and commonly accepted definitions, reflected in all specs including the OT spec. Even if that were the case, there are still situations that remain unclear, e.g. Adam Twardoch's example in which a font is actually embedded in a web page rather than dynamically linked:  \n [http://www.twardoch.com/webfonts/completelyembedded/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123214711/http:/www.twardoch.com/webfonts/completelyembedded/ \"http://www.twardoch.com/webfonts/completelyembedded/\")\n\n"

The divides to be crossed seem very great. And too many unspoken, hidden agendas.  \nBut it is only a feeling.\n\nI ask, who will be helped by it all, and how? The only thing a W3C recommendation will do is force, we assume, any hold-outs to support either WOFF or CWT (EOTL). And I really don't know if, in actual practice, that makes much of a difference one way or the other at this point.  \nFirst, there are thousands and thousands of freely licensed fonts to choose from.  \nSecond, AFAIK, the only major font vendor that has made any kind of an effort to hang a sign saying, \"Web Designers Welcome\", is Ascender. They relaxed restrictions with EOTL. They started the fontembedding.com web site. They've got demo pages. I can't say I'm absolutely thrilled with their current EULA and marketing approach - which is also a \"meet me by the back door\" affair at the moment, but at least there's been a clear willingness to market to web customers on terms that are in step with the way web customers are used to working. I mean, you can hope and hope and hope, but you're not going to convince working moms to stop in with the kids at the end of the day for a five course meal.  \nMonotype has just made it absolutely clear that they will not license to anyone who is not willing to enforce same origin restriction.  \n [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009OctDec/0111.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123214711/http:/lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009OctDec/0111.html \"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009OctDec/0111.html\")  \nI cannot conceive of a situation that would entice me or anybody to choose one of their typefaces - when so many others are available - with that requirement attached. So they can keep their fonts, keep their EULAs, and have a nice day. (Oh, and don't forget your embedding bits on the way out.)  \nFont Bureau has made it clear their fonts will be available for web licensing if and when an unused alternate universe becomes available in which to do so. (Unless my official DB decoder ring is malfunctioning. Maybe I'm wrong.)\n\nBut then again, the changes that have already taken place have been positive and very unexpected. Back in when, May? June?, any kind of movement seemed out of the question. There was no EOT \"Lite\", no WOFF, just an impasse.  \nAt least technologically, I do have more choices today than I did just a few months ago.  \nThings \\*have\\* been bleaker.  \nSo I guess we'll pour some tequila on it, and see what happens.\n\n"

Monotype: _I cannot conceive of a situation that would entice me or anybody to choose one of their typefaces - when so many others are available - with that requirement attached._\n\nSo how many commercial font licenses have you purchased in the past? What you seem to be forgetting, again, is that you probably are not the market for commercial font licensing, and nor are the vast majority of web authors. The market for commercial font licensing has always been, and will remain, a market of professional designers and their clients. Sure, there will be a minor market for font licensing to amateurs for web use, just as desktop publishing created such a market for print use. But the major market will remain a professional market, and decisions in such a market about what fonts to use are driven by a number of factors that you don't have to worry about, e.g. consistency with existing print media brand identity.\n\nNote also that, contrary to what you write here, Vlad did _not_ say that Monotype ‘will not license to anyone who is not willing to enforce same origin restriction’. What he said was:\n\n_Speaking on behalf of Monotype - our license does and will require some kind of protection mechanism be in place for our fonts to be used on the web - either same-origin restrictions or root strings or referrer checking or by another means (e.g. JS) that web authors would find appropriate to satisfy the license conditions._\n\nSo same-origin restriction is only one possible mechanism that will satisfy Monotype's license conditions, and the key is that the mechanism will be one that web authors find appropriate. This strikes me as similar to Ascender's 'reasonable measures', recognising that not all web authors have access to the same mechanisms and that some mechanisms are not scaleable, i.e. they might be appropriate to a large company with a dedicated IT department and their own servers but not to Joe Blogger.\n\nRichard, you seem to be wanting fully formed web font delivery systems in place yesterday, and are feeling pessimistic because this isn't the case. This is just plain silly. We're feeling our way, collectively, into new ways of doing business for a new medium. Font makers and vendors are testing the waters in various ways -- Typotheque, Typekit, Kernest, CWT, WOFF -- and, most importantly, looking to see what the browser makers are doing. To me, having watched the type business struggling to follow the lead of software companies for the better part of two decades, I'm actually feeling pretty positive about the degree of upfront engagement from font makers on the web font issue.\n\n"

It is applied by a browser by default, which means that the font (or any other resource linked in your CSS or HTML page) will only allowed to be used if it comes from the same origin (i.e. both font and HTML page are located on your server). The key here is that you, as a web author, do not have to do \\*anything\\* to enforce same-origin restriction, you only need to do \\*something\\* **if** you want to relax this restriction and allow HTML pages from other website link to the fonts hosted on your server.\n\nWhat I do want to see happened is to have other browsers supporting same-origin restriction sooner rather than later, and this was the essence of my message I tried to convey on W3C font list.
