Has anyone used this font in conjunction with other fonts in a brochure? And if yes, could you be kind enough to share font names that go well with Helvetica Neue?\n\nThanks very much.\n\n",

I am using Helvetica neue and I would like to complement it with another one for the text within the brochure (long sentences). I tried using the same font everywhere (different variations though) but while I like the font for headers, logo letters and so on, I found it very cold and too... mechanic?... for long paragraphs of text. Was wondering if there was another font I could use to ease a little on legibility. Your suggestions are welcome.\n\n"

      "content": "Transitional and Modern Serifs should work quite well, but also Garaldes like Garamond â€“ depends on what kind of atmosphere you aim at. If you are looking for a more human, legible, friendly touch, choose an open typeface from the Garalde subclass like Plantin, Galliard, Swift or Proforma For more neutrality browse the Transitional/Baroque like Utopia, Rotation, Farnham. More classy, austere look in the areas of Modern (bracketed) typefaces.\n\ngood suggestions: [http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100731080533/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/\")  \n [http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/times\\_new\\_roman/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100731080533/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/times_new_roman/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/times\\_new\\_roman/\")\n\nI would recommend a rather broad face with not too much contrast, something sturdy, real estate.\n\n"
