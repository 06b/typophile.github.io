It is also extremely rare for an “open, engraved, inline, handtooled” metal typeface to have the opened area of the letterform on the right side. Most commonly they are directly down the center or on the left. The reason for this is that the strength of color is usually on the left and during presswork this would help keep the letterform open. If on the right, to compensate for overall color, more ink might be required and the opened area would fill. As it has obviously in the example.\n\nGerald\n\n"
