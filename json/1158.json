  "content": "Hmmm. Reading the Jakob Nielsen interview at pixelsurgeon.com.   \n   \nHave been learning Flash over the last couple months and we are using it for our site.   \n   \nWould like to be judicious with motion, but at the same time, want our site to be fun, not boring. We're not selling embalming fluid. We're not actuaries.   \n   \nCan anybody justify Nielsen's take, or debunk it? Do design/font sites get special exemption from the Nielsen Rules?   \n   \nHere are some links, including Porky's take.   \n   \n   \n [http://www.pixelsurgeon.com/pages/interview/design/jakobnielsen/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023141739/http:/www.pixelsurgeon.com/pages/interview/design/jakobnielsen/index.html)   \n   \n [http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023141739/http:/www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html)   \n   \n [http://www.typographer.com/html/mag-opinion-speedway.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023141739/http:/www.typographer.com/html/mag-opinion-speedway.html)   \n   \nbj\n\n",

      "content": "It's interesting that when Nielsen talks about web usability he doesn't think about me.   \n   \nIf I view his very own site, the text is next to unreadable because of the completely liquid layout. I don't like to read lines which contain over 200 characters.   \n   \nBesides that, the yellow colour on his page makes me nauscious. Usability doesn't have to equal ugliness.   \n   \nHe's right on the other hand when he says that 99% (or whatever it is) of flash pages don't really need flash.\n\n"

      "content": "That book is 2 years old. Ancient in Web time   \n(the industry has learned a lot since then). In   \nfact, my clients never quote Nielsen   \nanymore... thankfully.   \n   \nIn the end, you've gotta decide who your user   \nis and what will work best for them. (For most   \nof Typophile, we've gone with the belief that   \nFlash is the best way to deliver content that is   \ntypographically true to the design. We also   \nknow that most of our users have the plugin   \nalready.)   \n   \nYou asked about Flash... A paste from   \nNielsen's [www.useit.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023141739/http:/www.useit.com/) says it better than I could:   \n   \n\\>The version of Flash introduced in 2002   \n\\>(Flash MX) has solved many of the technical   \n\\>usability problems in previous versions of   \n\\>Flash. Among other things, Flash MX   \n\\>supports accessibility and the \"Back\" button   \n\\>in the browser. A very important usability   \n\\>improvement is that Flash now ships with a   \n\\>standard set of interaction controls: finally,   \n\\>no more random scroll bars made up at the   \n\\>whim of a Flash designer.}   \n   \n(As an aside: Interesting how Nielsen's   \nchanged his tune now that Macromedia is his   \nclient... read the piece for yourself. In the end,   \nanything that helps this dogmatist think more   \nabout context is a good thing.)   \n   \n(The lesson: Bash a company publicly long   \nenough and they'll hire you as an expert?)\n\n"
