Were there not banks under Hitler, Mao, Mussolini, Marx etc (even if some were nationalized). Why not just say banks and leave out the “C” word.\n\nOr just ask about typefaces associated with the financial community.\n\nMichael\n\n"

      "content": "Jay\n\nI doubt you will find any books on this as the two subjects stand too far apart. I would suggest examining economic cycles and industrial production. In this case, say, design and sales of typefaces during periods of prosperity and recession. Capitalism is all about economic cycles, is it not? For instance, the back to back recessions that are termed the Great Depression had a significant impact on both new designs and production of Monotype faces. Why were/are Centaur and Bembo more successful/popular than Pastonchi? Well, examine the years of design and production and compare these to the worldwide economic situation of the time period. I’ve done a couple of these and it changes your viewpoint. Aesthetics are popularly, and intellectually lazily, assigned to the success of a typeface, when it is far more often due to other unacknowledged or forgotten factors, such as popular culture, economics, technology, etc.\n\nGerald\n\n"
