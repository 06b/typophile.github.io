I can't seem to find any info on it anywhere, and no longer have the font.\n\nI'll keep looking and add any other finds to this post.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109023855im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mirth_6512.gif)\n\n...found another called Gia, but can't find any info for it either. I have a feeling they might be from Japanese sites I used to visit in my addict days.\n\nAnother with a similar feel if you removed some weight is Hemi-head 426 by Ray Larabie\n\n"
