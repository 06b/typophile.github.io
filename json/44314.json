My solution is to shop somewhere else.\n\nI can't agree with the rest of the article, however. If the EULA clearly stated that you can get billed for shared copies of the font (and more importantly, sharing of the copies), then the company deserves what it gets. (In fact, the company that bought the font should be sending a bill for $944 to the sign company that posted the material on the sharing site.)\n\n"
