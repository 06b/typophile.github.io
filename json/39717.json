      "content": "Thanks Florian :) thats really useful\n\nhn20, yeah tht's a bit too modern and a bit too urban fr me because the photographs are mostly fashion and the style is retro-modern photographs.  \n ig its helping, most of the photographs style is like this site  \n [http://www.inqmnd.ca/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214164452/http:/www.inqmnd.ca/ \"http://www.inqmnd.ca/\")  \nonly more fashion class and more clean-dramatic look.\n\nif you guys can suggest some script it will be awesome too because I only basic script on my computer and currently looking to buy some of good script.\n\n"
