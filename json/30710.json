But probably only because I'm used to the old one which was so much more traditional. And what's with the yellow? Sigh.\n\nCan you guys make me feel better about it?\n\nK.\n\n",

That kind of style was slightly hip in the early 90s. The new design is more approachable if less serious feeling. But take heart, it appears that Concordia will rebrand at the drop of a hat so about 2012 you should be getting a logo using DIN. ;-) BTW, The yellow is meant to be gold I bet. But actually depending on what Concordia is planning this logo might be an accurate indicator. Logos are not just meant to keep us peons happy by looking 'good' by some arbitrary measure. They need to do a job. It may be that this one is doing the job that the Admin & marketing types have in mind. The question is - is that the job you think needs doing?\n\n"

The \"new\" slogan is \"This Is Now\".\n\nWhatever that means.... ;-(\n\n(As the Canada goose said after eating a field of green grass \"this too shall pass\"!)\n\n"

I perhaps should check this out before saying anything, but given the incredible amount of unilingual English stuff we produce -- and I'm including huge banners inside the school announcing events, recruitment and application materials -- I doubt the French on the logo was motivated by sign laws. Also, \"university\" is not smaller than \"université\".\n\nI think it has to do with a push to make everything we produce bilingual... to attract more students? because our new president is quebecois? who knows. I'm dreading the day they decide we need to have a bilingual Academic Calendar.\n\nAlthough you are right, Linda.

In fact, our online version is produced from the files used to create the hard copy.\n\nThis year there was some mumbling from above about making it available online only and adding interactivity between the Calendar and the Class Schedule from the registration interface. Hehe, and bilingual. However, we have neither the expertise nor the budget to make those kinds of changes. At least not now. We would all (the 4 of us in publications) need some heavy-duty training. And certainly extra staff and cooperation with the IT department. Since we are unionized and permanent, they can't simply replace us with someone more savvy (knocking on wood and keeping appendages crossed).\n\nHow's the online-only going at U of C? We did the same with our admission application. Printed only 2000 copies, all long gone, and are now insisting students apply online. I guess for the most part it hasn't had a negative effect, but the decision has certainly impacted the way we process applicants.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to read most everything hard copy. Professors constantly refer to the Calendar from offices with no computer or internet access, so what would they do? And, c'mon, in comparison to other things, it's not that expensive to print.\n\nK.\n\n"

When I am forced to work with only 4 letters, I try to find a style that doesn't accentuate the kerning problems potentially in that combination.\n\nEach college needs to do it's own thing, but they seem to be in a crisis as a service industry. What do they sell, how do they convince the market their version is better? How do they make certain that the market knows what they are looking at when they see the mark? Standard questions, and interesting in the context of universities as a sector.\n\nWith the need for the college industry to rebrand itself, might be a coming demand for the friendlier postmodern blackletter trend, which for now seems to be largely a thought experiment. The new blackletters might be an excellent compromise that holds some old colonial feel (which I don't think is necessarily bad, _from the client's perspective_), and the hipness they feel they need to now cater to.\n\n[Choz Cunningham](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014205233/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014205233/http:/www.exclamachine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014205233/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"
