  "content": "Hello! This is my first post to the forum and I am sorry if I am placing it in the wrong category, but this appeared to be the most appropriate.\n\nI have a compilation of images (all were originally watercolor/gouache paintings that have been digitally scanned for printing) that need to be labeled by name (images are mostly Baroque/Spanish colonial buildings), but some are of people/nature specifically. The font will be incorporated into the image.\n\nAs I am not a designer, I simply pulled fonts from my list in Word and those which I was drawn to in film/advertising. My initial leanings brought me to Helvetica Neue Ultralight and Neutraface. {Big suprise, I know.} I also like script fonts such as Davison Spencerian - it's not perfect, am seeking something looser. I do like the contrast of a minimalist font against the highly detailed paintings, but I thought that I would also like to pair it with something that is complementary to the ornate style of the architecture (as I will often need two lines of text: i.e. Building Name/Location City, Country).\n\nI had thought that I would go with Helvetica Neue Ultralight or Neutraface, but after reading some opinions on both, it seems that both are \"over\" and \"a bit obvious.\" What are your alternative suggestions? Thank you.\n\nP.S. If you need more information, I am seeking a font that will convey modernity. The images are going to be used on stationery items and I want something that is modern and chic.\n\n",

Instead of Helvetica I recommend Avenir. Personally I looove that typeface and I think you would too. It is a sans serif and is minimalistic but has a little style to it compared to the neutral Helvetica.\n\nAvenir: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418160122/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/\")\n\n"
