As it shows all the stroke variations used throughout a typeface, it should be a pretty good way to discern different typefaces.\n\nI’m curious also how everyone here goes about identifying typefaces. A lot of it is experience, but are there any other tips/tricks that anyone wants to share?\n\n [‹ San Francisco FontLab Class Starting 3/20/06](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203160216/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18358 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Veering away to Corbis ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203160216/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38979 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

That will give you a feeling for where to look. Other than that it’s sometimes spotting that glyph that stands out (or gives it away as Yves would say).\n\n"

It helps to jog your memory a little faster when you’re at the “I know I’ve seen this somewhere before...” phase of the ID.\n\nI started using this method a few years ago to help with my almost pathological inability to remember people’s names.

It is a common letter and can be found in most type samples, and is never quite the same from typeface to typeface.\n\nThen working with type, I learned a lot more. (I wish I had retained it all, but it’s slipping away from non-use.)\n\nCatogorizing the fonts and just looking at them day to day is a wonderful exercise. I may not remember the name, but I remember the year VGC put it on their typositor book, or that it started with the letter R and was in the old yellow book around the shop...\n\nMore modern times, I have found Font Expert a help — it is like the FBI with fingerprints. Doesn’t always works, but when it does, wahoooo... Yes, identifont is a great tool, and the folks above have it right - Mike Yangega (especially in “line” type) is a great guide.\n\nTake a friend with you into a bookstore and start guessing when you see typefaces you recognize... feels good doesn’t it?\n\nP.S. It isn’t whatthefont.com but...
