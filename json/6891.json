I bought it way back when I was starting with Fontographer, and I hated the book so much that I took it back to Tower and asked for my money back.   \n   \nTutorials on how to make auto-bolded Helvetica Oblique small caps? What the hell? I don't know, it just didn't seem up to snuff. And the book is set in like 24pt Goudy Handtooled or something.   \n   \nLast year I found a copy for $18, and sold it on Amazon for $150. I should have kept it around to squeeze another $1000 out of it ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108222737im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nI have always wanted a good technical reference on this stuff, but out of necessity I have played around so much that it's no longer quite the holy grail I once thought it would be. I thought about writing my own, but I just know it would be like, \"Well, then you kinda do this, and then this, and then you just gotta feel it out from there.\"   \n   \nNow, to Tim's original inquiry. If you're talking about extrema points, Hrant's right, they make things easier to work with, and they're desirable on the technical side (hinting/rasterization). However, they're not always needed for the little details, as David Lemon explains in this PDF about hinting: [http://www.pyrus.com/downloads/hinting.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108222737/http:/www.pyrus.com/downloads/hinting.pdf)   \n   \nIf you're talking about each curve having two BCPs: the reason this is needed is because pulling out one BCP automatically implies that there is a BCP on the other end of that curve segment. But if the other one is not pulled out, it's considered to be located directly on top of the anchor point, which is a PostScript no-no, or something.   \n   \nFontLab does a particularly good job of encouraging the designer to construct curves properly, by the way that it displays BCPs and anchor points.   \n   \nAlan\n\n"
