I also think you should develop and sell the compass mark by itself instead of clumsily trying to lock it in with some random typeface. Choose a typeface later when a mark has been decided on.\n\n"

It was designed by one logo designer for another, and latter happened to be a fraud and made a big fuss when he got caught. I am sure the ripples from that incident will eventually subside, but there is still a plenty of people in the logo design community who react nervously to that logo. This is in part why I remembered the logo in the first place.\n\n"

Those are 3 pieces of a compass rose that I illustrated myself, inspired by the art shared by \"ishbog\" above.\n\nYes the type is Alte Haas. I love the rounded corners so much. There is a company called Fido that does all of their promotional pieces with this style of type. I'm not sure if it is Alte Haas exactly.\n\nCan you suggest a type like this one that is bit more unique?\n\n"

Alternatively, and I realize it's a heresy, you can take any font and simply add a stroke around it with rounded joints.\n\nBTW I know of Fido and I really really like their slightly rounded font. I am too not sure if it's Alte Haas. It looks like it, but given the size of Fido I think they are more likely to commission the replica than to use an (effectively) abandoned font.\n\n(edit)\n\nHere's what I meant by adding a stroke to round the type. Top is Alright Sans Medium, bottom is Alright Sans Regular padded with stroke with rounded corners. You can see some distortion in letterforms, especially in /r/ and /e/, but it is not _that_ bad.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102824im_/http:/typophile.com/files/truebearing_5672.png)\n\n"
