  "content": "Hi guys - I'm building a font to learn fontlab, and i'm into kerning classes... I found this vid which seems cool about the basics of kerning classes and I follow it with my own font, building the exactly same sample he used in the vid (oTo, aTa, etc). It works quite well but when previewing the font (in the preview panel) or even building the font and testing in other software the kern didnt show ok - It only works with the 'oTo' (the main of the class group). What i'm doing wrong here?\n\nThis is the video.  \n [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDMmIJE-BQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203174703/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDMmIJE-BQ \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDMmIJE-BQ\")\n\nThanks in advance\n\n",
