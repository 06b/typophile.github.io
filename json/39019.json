Now I‘m in the situation that I have to decide between “Gentium” or “Andron”. (it’s not a question of cost)\n\nAny tip would be appreciated.\n\nVertex\n\n [‹ The House MD font!?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215013548/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39143 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [dark victorian type ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215013548/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39134 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

One or another of them could provide you with samples for evaluation.\n\n"

Gentium is very sturdy.\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"
