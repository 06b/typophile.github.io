If it falls at the end of a sentence it should have a space in front and behind followed by a full stop.\n\n"

      "content": "Not exactly, Héctor, considering the other languages.  \nFor example, in Russian if the ellipsis is put in the middle of the sentence it is always followed by space, but never preceded. If a sentence is ended with an ellipsis, it is the last glyph in the sentence (no further stop). It can also start the sentence — it this case the first character follows the ellipsis immediately and is lowercase.\n\n"
