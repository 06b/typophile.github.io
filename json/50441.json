  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI am encountering some problems in FontExplorer after upgrading my mac from Tiger to Leopard (10.5.5).  \nI am not able to properly preview ’rare’ ligatures any longer.\n\nSo to clarify, when I check ’Common’ I see for example the standard ’fi’ ligature, but activating ’Rare’ removes the ’fi’ ligature and additionally doesn’t show me any of the more advanced ligatures as it used to.\n\nAny ideas as to why this might be happening?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSeb\n\n [‹ CS3 \\> CS4 compatibility.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023162931/http:/typophile.com/node/50442 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New Ligature ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023162931/http:/typophile.com/node/50434 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
