I know that at least one book publisher is working on a subsidized ebook reader because printing costs are so high and so many books lose money. Now that Amazon is planning to use cheap ebooks as a loss leader and bring in money with subscriptions to other content I expect to see more publishers jump on board. If we suddenly have competing cabals of companies that actually understand typography all trying to best Amazon and each other we’ll hopefully see better ebook typography, and maybe some really great typefaces commissioned for ebook screens.\n\n"

But that was for me the most jolting part of the experience. Perhaps for any text there will be an optimum size that allows for good H&J for that text. But when the type size is adjusted for individual eyes or reading conditions, any optimum goes away.\n\nDisplaying Kindle texts as FL/RR won’t help this. There will still be far too many instances in which the machine cannot handle hyphenation, and will throw unsightly white space where it ain’t supposed to be.\n\nFigure this out and I’ll be more likely to buy an e-book device.

But in rural Africa, Asia, and South America, where there are no bookstores or good roads to truck books in on, eBooks are going to explode once the price drops. They’ll be huge in cities like Japan and Mumbai where families live in apartments the size of closets. Paper books are going to be a luxury item for spoiled Americans, like SUVs and gigantic televisions.\n\n<cite>We either offer something useful or we don’t.</cite>\n\nThe eBook side needs to offer up some documentation before the type world gets involved.

The same is true not only for e-books but also for web-browsers. (Essentially being the same.) With html/xml and css one may already define flexible layout that can adopt to the circumstances like resolution, display size, window size, desired type size, etc. The sole issue is the above-mentioned lack. Browsers/readers need to do exactly the same as the layout application of your choice does: proper text layout, hyphenation/linebreaking and justification. This would not even require alternative environments like WPF or plug-ins like Flash/AIR, at least not as long as we are talking about mere text ...  \nAnd I do not agree with e-book as niche product. The web is not a niche product either, despite sub-standard represenation of text. Improve browsers/readers and all will be fine.\n\n"
