This exhibition, organized by Monotype and designed by Pentagram for the AIGA National Design Center, celebrates 100 years of type as a constant influence in the world around us.\n\nGathering rare and unique works from premier archives in the United States and London, Century will serve as the hub of a series of presentations, workshops and events held at the AIGA gallery as well as the Type Directors Club and the Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design and Typography at Cooper Union in New York City. The exhibition features a range of artifacts representing the evolution from typeface conception to fonts in use. Typeface production drawings by the preeminent designers of the last 100 years, proofs, type posters and announcement broadsides are supplemented by publications, advertising, ephemera and packaging.\n\nExhibiting and event partners for the exhibition include Monotype, AIGA, Pentagram, Mohawk Paper, The Type Directors Club, Condé Nast, Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum, The Type Archive, The Herb Lubalin Study Center at Cooper Union, Alan Kitching and The Museum of Printing.\n\nExhibition design: Abbott Miller, Pentagram Design.\n\nSee the exhibition:\n\nThe exhibition is on view from May 1 at the AIGA National Design Center in New York City. The exhibition is free and open to the public.
