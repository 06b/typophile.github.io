  "content": "Hi there,  \nI have a major problem with InDesign CS2 not recognising kerning, neither class based nor classic kern table. InDesign CS1 works perfectly fine. I am generating OT TTF flavoured with all the necassary boxes ticked in FL 5.0.2 (see pic)  \nI know of at least another 3 people experiencing the same problem.\n\nCan anybody help?\n\nMuch appreciated,  \nvik\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017020913/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_29.png) | 71.32 KB |\n\n",

In short, if you ain't got no GSUB, you don't get no GPOS.\n\nMake up one substitution feature & recompile. You should now get kerning in InDesign.\n\n"
