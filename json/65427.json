You'll see in the pdf a bit of background about the design concept. Any crit would be very welcome; I'm hoping this can turn out to be really useable so tell me if there's anything you don't like or looks wonky. This has been six evenings' work, so I'm sure there's lots more to do. It reminds me a bit of Charter and a bit of FF Olsen, though I was thinking more along other lines: it actually started from playing with my first font, Eternal. \n\nFor some reason kerning didn't export with the otf file so the spacing looks a little gappy.\n\nLook forward to hearing your opinions! :) Thanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Feldspar Specimen.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418195610/http:/typophile.com/files/Feldspar%20Specimen.pdf) | 490.07 KB |\n| [Feldspar with Italics.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418195610/http:/typophile.com/files/Feldspar%20with%20Italics.pdf) | 949.05 KB |\n\n",

Your proportions are rock solid.\n\nThe spacing seems tight to me but I'm growing to think that's your style, and I don't see any major misfittings to trouble it.\n\nThe large serifs on the descenders work in concept, but they emphasize the stumpiness of the descenders on /p/ and /q/ and maybe get a little tight between serif and bottom of bowl on those letters. Would you consider lengthening your descenders?\n\n/S/ kind of reminds me of Palatino.\n\nCap /J/ is an unhandsome glyph to my eyes.\n\nIs the arm of /r/ too light and/or short?\n\n/y/'s curving stroke looks too soft I think.

I think you've got a very promising foundation here; I think it does still need a bit of time, and a bit of agonizing over detail decisions, and the diamond file; but if you allow it to have that, I think this can become seriously great.\n\nSalt ready? :)\n\nFirst, what are \"conventional proportions\"? You mean horizontally or vertically?\n\nI'm not sure about the notch action in things like the \"c\". Especially in the \"a\" that device seems to be quite the hype recently, and I wonder if it really helps or if it's just stylistically pretty.\\* Especially in your \"c\", it seems to add a bit of broad-nib pen flavor that I'm not sure matches the angularity of the glyph, or the overall tone of the font. Dunno. In any case, you might need a concept for where to put these (or I'm just not seeing it). Why doesn't the cap \"C\" have the notch? Or the \"o\"?\n\nI'm also still not sure of the slanting half-serifs on diagonals. For one thing, the left counter of the \"w\" looks larger than the right.\n\n\"f\": Very cool!  \n\"g\" seems a little dark.  \n\"r\" needs a more determined terminal. Look at \"kerning\": This \"r\" is prime \"combine with 'n' and track in to make an instant 'm'\" material. :-)  \n\"s\" looks too dark and/or needs more contrast.  \n\"w\" also looks too dark.  \n\"x\": Not sure, it is very funky. Looks a bit like an aleph. Hm. Craig, of course it's a rare letter – but OTOH, it looks like's in the font name!  \n\"y\": Counter might be too wide. Also not a fan of the soft tail.\n\n\"A\": I guess that taper in the crossbar has carried over from Eternal, but why is it there? It's barely visible now.  \n\"E\": Does the middle crossbar need more weight? The one in the \"A\" is much heavier. Also, why not put the flares the other way round, away from the stem – kinda like in the \"Z\"? (Also in \"F\" and \"L\".)  \n\"F\": Slightly narrow?  \n\"G\": Seems dark.  \n\"J\": That terminal is maybe a bit overkill, no? :)  \n\"M\": Yum! :)  \n\"R\": I think this could use a less soft / more determined leg.  \n\"T\": Why no flare?  \n\"W\" and \"Z\" look dark.\n\nAnd I think the question mark is too oldstyle.\n\n\\* I think trying to balance functionality and style in a text font that also works for display is very ambitious; it might be fruitful to set clear priorities, like if you want to make this work as a text font, do that first, and then see what you'd need to change to make it also work for display?

Thanks guys, I'm delighted to have such positive feedback from people with such talent :)  \nRight, a few comments for now.\n\nTarget size: I was thinking 8-10pt. I realise that might be quite a large range to cover and am learning more about these considerations only by listening to what you guys have to say on the matter...so if there are things I can do to make that work better then great, and if I need to be more specific then I will say let's make it the upper end of that range since it seems to take more technical experience to design really tiny faces? Although Hrant might have a point that this is already better suited for news. I'm really no expert.\n\nHrant, that is indeed a great quote. I was already thinking of throwing out the K and k but so far didn't due to other people suggesting it was a strong glyph. I think it was the first glyph I drew. Maybe I can keep it for something else.\n\nThe lowercase c: Right. That notch and the one in a were the start of an experiment that looks like it didn't work. Following Jos's advice on Flickr I drew the rest of the glyphs with smooth curves and hadn't come back to correct a and c; also wanted to see what feedback they would elicit. Still, I like the textured feel they bring in so need to think about how that could be maintained without the curve notches.\n\nSpacing: wow, this is where my noneducation is seriously getting in the way! I thought I'd made it pretty loose already! You know, I was hesitating about making a separate display cut since I really like chunky rather than overcontrasty and light faces. But I've rethought this now and there's no reason a display face shouldn't keep the characteristics I like so perhaps I will after all. I like Nina's footnote and agree that approach sounds right for this face.\n\nNina, conventional proportions: I meant that it wasn't as condensed as many of the trendy text faces (like the ones that come out of Reading's MATD); however, on reflection it seems to be following that model quite closely.\n\nJ: Aargh, I knew this was the weakest link and it'd be obvious I hadn't decided quite what was best for it. I tried various different treatments of the terminal and couldn't settle on any particular decision. Has anyone seen any fonts with a really good J? I was looking for something with unconventional treatment, again chunky and perhaps reversed stress?\n\nE,F: Yes, I see what you mean. Those serifs on the right need to be much bigger. May try reversing the flares too — thanks for the suggestion Nina. I did try flaring the T and it looked rubbish. Let's see.\n\n"

Not sure it'd work, but I keep wondering.\n\nAgree with Hrant that the \"g\" is dark in the tail, and the \"y\" is very cool. About the \"g\" I now wonder about the notch in the tail – it looks funky, but now that the other notches are gone, I wonder how much it still belongs in the font.\n\nI still wonder if the \"r\" could be made stronger – its foot serif is almost as strong as its, uh arm?. Maybe a terminal of some sort? But maybe it's OK.\n\n\"k\": I'd raise the crossbar. Maybe in the cap too.\n\nThe slanted half-serif on the top-left of the \"x\" feels alien to my eye.\n\nNot sure what to think of the OSF \"5\". It's a bit unexpectedly old-style with that upward top serif. But maybe that can actually work quite nicely.\n\nI like the big serifs on your nums (although the one on the lining \"5\" might be a bit much?), just wondering, have you tried a foot serif on the \"7\"?

May remove both notches but am a bit worried it'll make the counters too small without some other solution.\n\nHrant: I'm wondering about the relative proportions of extenders. I thought the extenders should get longer at text sizes and shorter at display sizes, but it seems you're saying that a 9pt-optimal cut should have longer ascenders than an 8pt-optimal cut. Can you explain? And to me (and Craig I think), the descenders look quite short already, yet I think you'd like them to be somewhat shorter?

Maybe try a terminal like in the \"f\" and \"j\".\n\n\\> I thought the extenders should get longer  \n\\> at text sizes and shorter at display sizes\n\nIn my view extenders do something mostly functional at text sizes, but mostly aesthetic at display sizes. So for text sizes they need to vary depending on the target point size, while for display they need to vary based almost entirely on your taste!\n\nEspecially in a text face, vertical proportions, color and spacing are very strongly inter-related. If you have a certain color, that implies a certain narrow range of proportions and spacing that can result in good readability. Usually it's best to decide the target point size (since that's what users mainly choose); the other two mostly follow from that.\n\nThe smaller the target text size, the larger the x-height needs to be (which means shorter extenders)\\*. What I'm seeing here is around 8-9 point. If you want to lean smaller I'd make the descenders shorter; if you want to lean larger I'd make the ascenders longer. So I'm not actually recommending one over the other; the main thing is for ascenders to be sufficiently longer than descenders. But of course this is not an exact science.\n\n\\* Don't worry about cap height too much here.\n\nBTW, I'm not good enough to be able to recommend small tweaks based on a PDF - I might be able to do it if I saw some hi-quality printed output. But really, such small degrees of change start wading into aesthetics (something no font is entirely devoid of) so you might easily disagree with somebody. My own taste BTW leans towards darkish fonts.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I also think I don't want to add too much interest to the baseline, and the trumpet-snout terminal (as Nina christened it) would bee too much.\n\nOne of my original premises was to add interest and emphasis only to the areas of glyphs away from the baseline. Since there's always a lot of activity at the baseline I figured the eye might find it easier to read if the less frequent parts were emphasised.

Maybe the bottom 1/4 of it could somehow be firmed up?\n\nIs is possible that lining zero is a touch too heavy in the upper right and lower left quadrants?\n\nI really do love that lining seven with the serif!\n\nSomething I really admire about what you've done here is capture the style I associate with oldstyle figs in those figures, and the style of lining figs in those (after all, there's more of a difference than simply presence or absence of extenders), while keeping the two sets stylistically uniform as a font. Really nice work.\n\n"

      "content": "Craig, thanks. That's really nice to hear. When I was working on these I realised that the two sets could be 'emancipated' (as Nina would say I think), so the lining ones have more in common with the uppercase and the oldstyle ones share characteristics with the lowercase. Hence the lining ones have slightly more vertical stress as well as more serifs. I'm really pleased you think this has been successful, except for a minor tweak to a couple of glyphs. You're right about the 5. (The lining one, yes?) That's going to be hard to get right, but coming back to look at it now, looks like it needs widening and the stress rotated like you say.\n\n"
