It's the typeface used on the cover and throughout the book \"BRANDING TERROR\". At first I thought it was MISO but it's not. Any thoughts?\n\nGreat book BTW.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [534566\\_132659110221084\\_959351593\\_n.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140527134650/http:/typophile.com/files/534566_132659110221084_959351593_n.jpg) | 67.59 KB |\n\n",
