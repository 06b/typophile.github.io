Here's a part of the error messages I get:  \n[WARNING] Use of DFLT tag has been deprecated. It will work, but please use 'dflt' instead.

I'm able to generate a TT font, which features pixelated edges compared to an older version of the font I was able to generate in OTF format. I'm assuming the fact I can't generate OTF right now has to do with the errors. I have to have 2 fonts of the typeface finished by the end of the week so it's really appreciated if you can help me out with this. Can someone also tell me what I'm doing by specifying Greek, Latin and Romanian in the script? I assumed I need to specify Romanian to replace some accented characters, but I don't need Greek. I'm working on full language support for Latin.\n\nHere's an example of the script I'm working with:\n\nfeature clig {  \n # DEFAULT  \n sub I J by Y.alt1;  \n sub I j by Y.alt1;  \n sub T h by T\\_h;  \n sub a e by ae;  \n sub a.alt1 e by ae;  \n sub f f by f\\_f;  \n sub f i by f\\_i;  \n sub f f i by f\\_f\\_i;  \n sub f j by f\\_j;  \n sub f f j by f\\_f\\_j;  \n sub f l by f\\_l;  \n sub f f l by f\\_f\\_l;  \n sub f t by f\\_t;  \n sub f f t by f\\_f\\_t;  \n sub f question by f\\_question;  \n sub f question.alt1 by f\\_question.alt1;  \n sub f\\_f question by f\\_f\\_question;  \n sub f\\_f question.alt1 by f\\_f\\_question.alt1;  \n sub g g by g\\_g;  \n sub i j by i\\_j;  \n sub f i j by f\\_i\\_j;  \n sub r r by r\\_r;  \n sub t t by t\\_t;  \n sub period period period by ellipsis;  \n sub comma hyphen by comma\\_endash;  \n sub comma endash by comma\\_endash;  \n script grek; # Greek  \n sub I J by Y.alt1;  \n sub I j by Y.alt1;  \n sub T h by T\\_h;  \n sub a e by ae;  \n sub a.alt1 e by ae;  \n sub f f by f\\_f;  \n sub f i by f\\_i;  \n sub f f i by f\\_f\\_i;  \n sub f j by f\\_j;  \n sub f f j by f\\_f\\_j;  \n sub f l by f\\_l;  \n sub f f l by f\\_f\\_l;  \n sub f t by f\\_t;  \n sub f f t by f\\_f\\_t;  \n sub f question by f\\_question;  \n sub f question.alt1 by f\\_question.alt1;  \n sub f\\_f question by f\\_f\\_question;  \n sub f\\_f question.alt1 by f\\_f\\_question.alt1;  \n sub g g by g\\_g;  \n sub i j by i\\_j;  \n sub f i j by f\\_i\\_j;  \n sub r r by r\\_r;  \n sub t t by t\\_t;  \n sub period period period by ellipsis;  \n sub comma hyphen by comma\\_endash;  \n sub comma endash by comma\\_endash;  \n script latn; # Latin  \n sub I J by Y.alt1;  \n sub I j by Y.alt1;  \n sub T h by T\\_h;  \n sub a e by ae;  \n sub a.alt1 e by ae;  \n sub f f by f\\_f;  \n sub f i by f\\_i;  \n sub f f i by f\\_f\\_i;  \n sub f j by f\\_j;  \n sub f f j by f\\_f\\_j;  \n sub f l by f\\_l;  \n sub f f l by f\\_f\\_l;  \n sub f t by f\\_t;  \n sub f f t by f\\_f\\_t;  \n sub f question by f\\_question;  \n sub f question.alt1 by f\\_question.alt1;  \n sub f\\_f question by f\\_f\\_question;  \n sub f\\_f question.alt1 by f\\_f\\_question.alt1;  \n sub g g by g\\_g;  \n sub i j by i\\_j;  \n sub f i j by f\\_i\\_j;  \n sub r r by r\\_r;  \n sub t t by t\\_t;  \n sub period period period by ellipsis;  \n sub comma hyphen by comma\\_endash;  \n sub comma endash by comma\\_endash;  \n language ROM ; # Romanian  \n} clig;\n\n",

      "content": "Probably Mark Simonson is onto something, whether you can spot it or not.\n\nBy the way, your clig statements are all messed up. First of all, as Mark says, they're not contextual, as written. Secondly, remember that instructions are performed in the order they're given. So with the order you have:\n\nsub f f by f\\_f;  \nsub f i by f\\_i;  \nsub f f i by f\\_f\\_i;\n\nthe string \"f f i\" will never be found, because you've already changed part of that string, \"f f\" (i.e., a portion the string \"f f i\") to f\\_f.\n\nEtc.\n\nYou have to do it the other way, with the f f i statement first.\n\nHere's a portion of the clig description (emphasis added)\n\n> Example: The glyph for ft replaces the sequence f t in Bickham Script, **except** when preceded by an ascending letter.> Recommended implementation: The clig table maps sequences of glyphs to corresponding ligatures in a chained context (GSUB lookup type 8). **Ligatures with more components must be stored ahead of those with fewer components in order to be found.** The set of contextual ligatures will vary by design and script.\n\nI'd remark that the usual way to debug a long list of statements is to cut things in half, and try each half. Keep cutting until things compile without errors. If you're lucky, you'll spot it. Safest is to just add one more statement at a time. And if the rest of your code is as scrambled as clig, I'd just start with one statement, get it to compile, then add each, one at a time.\n\nLong ago & far away, I had to do logical proofs -- passed my PhD prelims in math logic. When I used the techniques learned there in trying to debug even little programs, my business partner -- a proper engineer -- finally convinced me of the error of my ways. He succeeded in large part because I kept failing, trying to be \"logical...\"\n\n"

      "content": "Where to start?\n\nIt might be easier, if you are on deadline, to send your fonts so someone who can make the OpenType fearures work (and no, I don't do that work.) Many of the larger font publishers work this way, Adobe, FontFont, etc. You don't think Slimbach writes all the features for his fonts, do you?\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI say they are not contextual because you have not included the context as a part of the substitution statement. OpenType features code is pretty simple in the sense that everything happens \"right now.\" The items to be included in the substitution must be given in their entirety in the statement, as they exist \"right now\" -- as the instruction is processed.\n\nAnd the order matters. So, if you have liga before clig, much of the \"ligaturing\" you're attempting in clig won't happen, because there will be no longer be any f i, f f i, etc. And if you put clig first, then what's available for liga to work on will be affected, of course.\n\nIf you're working entirely in FontLab -- I suppose you know you can write off the features file, then alter it in a text editor, then read it back in to FL. I'd recommend that. I, anyway, also make sure all my classes are in that .fea file, then delete the \"classses\" from the FontLab vfb. This way, I have one file where everything is contained, and if I make a change to either an OT feature or class, when I bring the fie back into FontLab, I don't create an unintended conflict.\n\nHow I'd start if I had to work on your font, starting now.\n\n1. Make a copy of the FoltLab .vfb, and work on that. Don't risk you original files.\n\n2. Write off all the features (making sure the classes are contained) to a plain text .fea file. Clear the features and clases from FontLab; all you now have are the glyphs. See if you can generate a font. That's the starting point.\n\n3. Now add one thing at a time -- make up a small, test, \".fea\" file. One feature only. Make sure any feature you put in it has all the classes it needs -- i.e., pair the classes in \"test\" to the features in \"test.\n\n4. Read the \"test.fea\" back into Fontlab. At first anyway, both compile the features and generate a font to test that all is well.\n\n5. Keep adding things one at a time. You will soon discover what's not working.\n\n"

Still, I obviously would like to get the OpenType features to work as soon as possible, because I do have to send updates on the fonts.\n\n\"I say they are not contextual because you have not included the context as a part of the substitution statement.\"  \nWhat do you mean by this?\n\n\"So, if you have liga before clig, much of the \"ligaturing\" you're attempting in clig won't happen, because there will be no longer be any f i, f f i, etc.\"  \nActually I got all of that to work in a previous font. I did do the order of the ligatures correctly, but I don't think I paid specific attention to the order of the ligature classes. Perhaps I accidentally got the order right though. In any case, this will probably avoid a lot of frustration.\n\n\"I, anyway, also make sure all my classes are in that .fea file, then delete the \"classses\" from the FontLab vfb.\"  \nI think I'm confusing features with classes. I hope so, because that will explain why my font keeps searching for small caps.

I will put the features back in later and see if it all still works.\n\nSo, thanks a lot for the help. I was also wondering, when I change diacritics, some don't update to the letters and when I change the a plain letter, not all instances of that letter with diacritics are updated. I assume this is an issue with the classes? I find the class system to be confusing. I would follow a lot more tutorials on Fontlab but there are so few.\n\nAlso, how do you go about making tabular figures? I have the design done and the glyphs are in FontLab but I put each number in the glyph window individually, and so the spacing isn't consistent throughout all figure sets. Is there a way to simply copy the default and oldstyle sets and make them tabular automatically? Or should I first create the tabular sets, copy those and modify the spacing for the proportional sets?\n\n"

Moreover, you need \"calt\" in the example above, as there in one instance where no ligature is involved -- namely, \"iogonek f\".\n\nIt's rumored that Bingham Script uses clig, but I don't have that at home to take a peek...\n\n"

I don't see anything about \"contextual ligatures\".\n\n\"EOF\" means \"end of file\" which suggests that there is some structure that's not closed. That could be a missing semicolon at the end of a feature, or a missing brace (\"}\") or something like that.\n\nHow did you delete the features? If it's saying \"syntax error at 'feature'\" that suggests there is still at least one feature and that there is something wrong with it.\n\nIt's pretty hard to tell what's wrong given the small amount of information you've provided. Can you post a screen shot of the OpenType and Classes panels maybe?\n\nAlternatively, I would suggest asking over at the FontLab forum, where there are a lot more FontLab users hanging out than here.

Last night I checked the script of the font I did a few years ago and noticed I'm using calt there and not clig. Aren't these activated by the same OT button though? In my previous font they were turned on with the contextual button. Thanks a lot for the information. I will have another look at my code.\n\n"

      "content": "Regarding composites, you may want to read the section of the FontLab manual on composites, and the use of the \"generate glyph\" (Cmd/Ctrl - G) command. Basically, do Generate Glyph and type, say \"a+acute=aacute\" and you will get an aacute created as a composite referencing those two base glyphs. If you go in and try to edit the aacute you will see that these are references to the original glyphs, not editable outlines themselves. This way, changes to either component will affect the composite. Pretty nearly all your accented characters should use glyphs constructed this way.\n\nThe glyphs generated when you click on an empty cell are created based on recipes in the \"alias.dat\" file. This is an editable plain text file used by FontLab (although I'd be careful to back it up before hacking it).\n\nT\n\n"

If you are in an active character window, use the sequence \"alt\" + \"insert\" (i.e, hold down the \"alt\" key whilst hitting \"insert\" -- at least, that is the sequence with Windows), to bring in any component glyph -- by name, Unicode number, or anything else on a long list of options displayed. Move it around the way you move any component around.\n\nActually, you can bring in the base character that way, too. Just double click on a grayed-out cell, open it, select the base glyph with alt + insert (or Mac equivalent), and that will be the character the widths & sidebearings have. Same sequence again for any number of \"accents.\" All these will be components -- unless you eventually decompose, which isn't recommended save for glyphs where the components overlap.\n\nWhen all the artwork is in place, make sure both the \\*name\\* and \\*Unicode\\* assignments are proper...\n\nMay I gently suggest that part of your troubles is perhaps because you \\*don't\\* know how it should work?\n\n"
