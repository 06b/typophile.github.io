For 'Luxury,' as a display face with a wonderful but very limited appeal, you're not going to sell thousands anyway.   \n   \nThe rational basis for pricing is not the work that goes into it, but what will gross the most for the product given the market.

Given the extent of font piracy in the larger market, there is something to be said for high prices and a limited market: among other things, you can be pretty certain that TEFF has a very different relationship with its customers than Adobe has. Likewise Gerard Unger, and also some American type designers such as Sumner Stone. Interesting to note that Sumner used to work for Adobe, so he knows both sides of the font pricing question. If you buy a font from the Stone Foundry, you not only pay a lot more than you would for an Adobe font, you also have to _sign_ a license contract. Such things reinforce the value of what is being purchased.   \n   \nI don't think either approach is _bad_ marketing. They are different approaches to different markets. There are people who are willing to pay a premium for quality fonts and who understand that one of the things they are paying for is relative exclusivity: they want fonts that not every Tom, Dick and Harriet graphic designer has on his or her hard drive.   \n   \nAre you saying that it is bad marketing for Emiglio Zegna to price their clothes so that the Walmart shoppers can't afford them?   \n   \nAnd how do you measure the success of a small foundry like TEFF?

      "content": "Eduardo, I don't see the difference in the 'A's. What is the difference? (I am talking about the ALDO logo not the flash animation, which I guess has some light Helvetica.)   \n   \nJohn, I agree that both approaches can make sense, or not. It just depends on the market - or, to use economists language, on the price elasticity for the good in question.   \n   \nI also can easily believe an alternative theory: that the TEFF and DTL people make their livelihood mainly from teaching and commissioned work, and that the foundries are sidelines. And that they are too busy with other stuff to market properly.   \n   \n(Evidence: DTL has been promising that van Krimpen's Romulus, which I adore, would be out in three months, for about three years. The current 'deadline' is August 2003; it has been changed four times, I think. They are also selling FontMaster, which seems to be a higher priority.)   \n   \nBeing an abominable marketer myself, I would be the last to say this weakness puts the good folks at these places in a bad light.   \n   \nYou may be right that they are following an optimal path for marketing. But I tend to believe my eyes. I don't see their faces here, and the work is great stuff, according to many on these boards, as well as amateur me. To me that raises a real question mark.   \n   \nAs to Hrant's reasonable question why they should succeed there and not here: it is different selling to their countrymen, who will buy out of friendship and national loyalty in a small country.   \n   \nI'm definitely not saying I know better. And I learned from a similar discussion on Typographica that eg. different car models price for different niches. But I am saying that the evidence makes me question whether charging ten times more really is an economic benefit to them.   \n   \nIn this thread people are questioning Christian Schwartz's decision on 'Luxury', and defending DTL and TEFF. My intuition is that it is the other way around. I've been wrong before, lots, but I notice that sometimes when that little bell goes off sometimes I'm right too.\n\n"
