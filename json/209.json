      "content": "I have a very nice copy of this particular specimen book. The Italian foundry specimen books are always wonderful to page through. Lots of faces there are relatively unknown in the Anglo-American sphere.   \n   \nOne of the faces, Fregio Serie 900 was a grid construct. Very cool. Various pieces of the shapes of letterforms could be put together to form the actual letterform. Sort of like Sumner Stone's Means/Ends, but, as a metal face, I'd bet a lot more fun to put together.\n\n"

Oak Knoll (US), Veatches (US), Francis Wakeman (UK), Minotaurus (Netherlands), etc.   \n   \nPrices for this probably run anywhere from $75 to $250 (I'm taking an educated guess) dependent upon condition and dealer knowledge.   \n   \nSome of the earlier Nebiolo (1930s?) are really something. Fat little suckers just packed with goodies.   \n   \nHoping you have a happy birthday.\n\n"

The specimen sheet, showing the face from 12pt to 60pt, is a great example of optical sizing. Incredible.\n\n"
