They are in a process of changing from Quark to InDesing CS, and came accross a small problem.\n\nWhen typing prices without cents they use ,- (50,-) kerned so, that the hyphen is flush left with the full stop. Font used is Helvetica Neue Heavy Condensed. When there are cents, they use superscript.\n\nIs it possible to define the .- pair so, that it would behave the same way every time, regardess the size of the font, while the kerning of numbers would stay normal? And if it’s possible, how do I do it?\n\n",

Or at least I haven’t figured it out, yet.\n\nApparently it is possible to define a single kerning pair for just one font in Quark, which is what they have been using until now.\n\n"

The people who work on the job 8 hours a day don’t want to kern them one by one.  \nObviously, if the function can’t be automated, they have to create a character style sheet or use your method. That would be ok, but not as fast.\n\nBert, thank you for the link, it looks interesting. They seem to be having problems at the moment (page not found), will try again later.\n\n"
