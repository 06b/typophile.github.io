I have been running the standard  \nfontbook that obviously come with 10.4 but I really don’t feel comfortable with it.\n\nI have used a Mac for a few years now and every problem that I have with them seems  \nto stem back to fonts?\n\nCould anyone pass on some experienced words of wisdom on where to best store fonts  \nin OS 10.4 and the most effective management systems?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Software engineers don’t come cheap.  \nOne would assume that if the product will be free, it’s main purpose is to \\*encourage\\* people to purchase Linotype’s fonts.  \nIt would seem that there is at least a little room there for conflicts of interest. For example, managing OpenType fonts is much easier since most OpenType fonts on the market have been recently released and are from major vendors. It could be that support for Postscript and Mac TrueType might be lacking in the hope of selling people new editions of typefaces they already own. There was some similar discussion around this topic concerning Adobe’s Garamond Premier Pro. There are some nice features in those products, but it’s really a tough sell for people who already have a licensed version of Garamond.  \nThat said, Adobe used to sell both type and manager. But then, Adobe was also selling PageMaker and Illustrator.\n\n"
