I have read the FontLab manual, and the FontFlasher manual, followed the directions to the letter, and still the typeface blurs when used dynamically in Flash.   \n   \nI would be eternally grateful to anyone with advice on how to solve this problem. I am completely at a loss and very frustrated.   \n   \nHere is a sample of the typeface in action (on the right is a sample of one that works correctly in Flash) -   \n [http://www.stereotypography.com/bfuq2/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121091508/http:/www.stereotypography.com/bfuq2/)\n\n [‹ Can&#39;t generate OpenType font from FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121091508/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5215 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New Java-based Font Editor ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121091508/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5229 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Sucks, doesn't it?   \n   \nThere are only two ways to fix this that I know of:   \n   \n1. Use FlashMX 2004 and switch aliasing ON for the text field. The drawback is that you if you export this for pre-Flash 7 players, it doesn't work.   \n   \n2. Set the quality setting for the movie to LOW. This is the only way to do it for pre-MX 2004 versions. Unfortunately, this affects everything, not just the text field.\n\n"

Any other details you can provide about the fonts? (PostScript, TrueType, etc.) In other words, I'm not sure how it's even working in the lower right text box. It seems like it shouldn't...\n\n"

He has tried this with both versions, but I believe we are looking at the TTF version. I assumed that the problem was metrics causing the blurring, but my flash programmer says that no metrics are involved at all. Does that help clarify?   \n   \nI generated the typeface using FontLab and FontFlasher with Python. I have generated a TTF and a PS1 version with an 8pt bitmap for him to use, both generate the exact same problem with the blurring that we see in the example above.\n\n"

This can get complicated with multiple lists. I'd write a global to local script to force the textfield to a whole pixel position on the root timeline.   \nAlso use Math.floor to fix that floating point integer bug.   \nAnd make sure your text isn't center justified or anything like that.\n\n"

I have seen this same problem with other   \nVector \"bitmap\" fonts when pulled dynamically into Flash.   \n   \nThe only fix I've found is to use fonts from [Miniml](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121091508/http:/www.miniml.com/). You can see   \nStandard working on the Typophile home page. Even Unibody   \n(Underware) and various FontsForFlash faces produce the   \nblurring when the text is dynamic.   \n   \nMakes me wonder if these other fonts have the same word   \nspacing issue.\n\n"
