This face is a reconstruction of Spire (1937) drawn by Sol Hess. The skeleton of Spire Roman stands with the serifs removed. Like Spire, this font has no lower case, but does offer alternate cap styles in some of the lower case positions. Spire and Obelisk have both been use prominently in the fashion industry.\n\n[http://www.p22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070711214205/http:/www.p22.com/)  \n [http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/obelysk.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20070711214205/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/obelysk.html)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070711214205im_/http:/typophile.com/files/obelyskgrotesk_6183.gif)\n\n",
