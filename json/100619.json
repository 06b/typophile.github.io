(Clearly not the same as some of the more angular 'blocky' college fonts- looks to me as if the serifs are curved not block type, but could just be my eyes!)\n\nsuggestions and thought please folks.

Here are some, matching only /P specifications, hoping there'd be at least one that could meet your expectations: [Egyptienne](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074051/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/egyptienne-2/), [Clarendon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074051/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/clarendon/) (MT version [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074051/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/clarendon/)), [Xenia](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074051/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/xenia/) (the only one with straight-legged /R, more \"varsity\" to me), [Gold Fever](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074051/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/gold-fever/) ( [Bookman](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074051/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/bookman) track I've decided not to follow because too far from varsity style to me)  \nThe other option would be to start with any geometric slab serif of your choice and rework transitions for each letters you need. Here is what I've done starting from [Rockwell](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074051/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/rockwell), reworking serif transition and recreating /O and /C (may be /R leg would have need some tweaking).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074051im_/http:/typophile.com/files/princeton_4921.png)\n\n"

The font suggestions (particularly Xenia) are definitely the sort of thing I was looking for!  \nThanks too for taking the time to play around with Rockwell and create the text image you posted...more food for thought.\n\nAgain, many thanks and best wishes\n\nSteve\n\n"
