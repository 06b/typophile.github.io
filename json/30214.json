  "content": "Hi Typophiles,\n\nI'm very pleased to announce that [Beorcana](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014135843/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Beorcana) is finished and released: all 28 fonts. [Tal Leming](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014135843/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Tal%20Leming) did the final mastering, and there were many helpful people who critiqued the shapes, diacritics and performance. It's been a ponderous undertaking. My intention was to produce a workhorse book typeface without serifs, with display variants, for general use. I think it's successful, but I'll be very interested to see how people use it; a typeface comes to life with use.\n\nFont will be posted for sale on fonts.com in mid-January. I'll be updating [www.beorcana.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014135843/http:/www.beorcana.com/ \"www.beorcana.com\") with more information and a better specimen PDF when I come back from vacation in January.\n\n",

I also love that it’s something that even can’t be compared with all the \"look-a-likes\" of the somewhat \"trendy\" typefaces that are released from different foundries all of the time.\n\nThis is far more unique and it’s letterforms will definately live a long life far beyond all of these trends.\n\nI will definately remember Beorcana, and eventually buy it, as soon as I find a project to use it for.\n\nSalutes from Sweden! Great work!\n\n"
