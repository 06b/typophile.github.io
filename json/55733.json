I want the high/low joins to happen automatically. At first I put them in calt because, well, they are contextual alts o+r -\\> o+r.high ( [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203162010/http:/typophile.com/node/52410)). However some major apps (Illustrator CS2) don't have calt on by default, but most do have liga on. I have seen many examples in the wild of nicely designed scripts ruined by ignorance about calt.\n\nWould it be a problem to do this kind of sub inside liga? The result is very ligature-esque and I can't imagine a time when you'd want ligs on, but this off, or visa versa.\n\nAnything I'm overlooking? Thx!\n\n",

They can just as easily keep ligatures on while attempting to track it out. Since your script is connected using ligatures seems like a reasonable way to go. You could even use the clig feature, though its probably not necessary in your case.\n\n"
