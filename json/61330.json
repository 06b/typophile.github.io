  "content": "To my utter delight, the new [AFDKO](http://web.archive.org/web/20131218053818/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/) now supports proper mark-to-base and mark-to-mark features -- not limited to TrueType 'attachment points', it works perfectly with CFF (Type 1s) as well. So I spend the weekend updating my accents font, removing all rligs that glued a myriad of specifically spaced accents to a few characters and replacing them with a single accent glyph. I even could use the free DTL OTMaster Light to proof them! (And I am utterly convinced the full version is worth its full price, because with that I could have done the positioning straight away!)\n\nHere's the catch.\n\nTraditionally, I positioned my accent glyphs _after_ its base glyph, then manually kerned it into place. The positioned accents I created had, therefore, to be of zero width and _on the left side_ of the zero line. After some initial problems, I worked out I still could position its anchor points on the base point per accent:\n\n` markClass [@ALLTOPMARKS] <anchor -250 500> @TOP_MARKS;`\n\n-- the entire accent glyph is centered horizontally inside a 500 unit wide rectangle. So all I had to do was for umpteen characters figure out where _their_ (optical) center was, and set the position for their anchor:\n\n` position base [g] <anchor 240 500> mark @TOP_MARKS\n\t\t  <anchor 240 -250> mark @BOTTOM_MARKS;`\n\nWorks like a charm in OTMaster. I could even work out vertical stacking of the accents (mark-to-mark). Now the strange thing is, when testing with InDesign CS4, vertical stacking works as advertised, but the **horizontal position** is off by an entire character width. If I type in\n\nm \\<acute\\>\n\nthe acute appears the exact width of the 'm' to the right. I have confirmed this by typing in another 'm' right after the acute, and _then_ the accent was placed perfectly -- on the next 'm'.\n\nWhat are the conventions for combining accents? Should they have a non-zero width after all? (I think their widths would be discarded because they're positioned with the mark-to-base feature.) Should they be zero-width and on the _right hand side_ of the null line? (That would imply that, lacking mark-to-base, one would type first the accent and then the base glyph -- which is, I admit, _also_ a historical convention -- typewriter style.)\n\nOr is OTMaster behaving correctly, and IDCS4 not?\n\n",

In this case, the width is collapsed in the GPOS lookups as part of the mark positioning.]\n\nIt doesn't matter where on the zero-width the actual outline is positioned. Typically, the default position is set to offset the mark over the preceding letter in cases where GPOS mark attachments are not supported. So for left-to-right scripts the outline is offset to the left of the zero-width, and for right-to-left scripts it is offset to the right. [The exception is Hebrew, in which the marks are typically centered optically on the zero-width, which allows them to be used by legacy Hebrew engines that employed algorithmic horizontal positioning.]\n\n"

It doesn't matter whether I add a bottom accent or not -- the result is the same.\n\nI don't trust my OTF font making abilities enough, so I did the same using Legendum, with this result (CS4):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131218053818im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ie_no_fun_3801.PNG)\n\nand SIL Doulos -- top WordPad, bottom CS4:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131218053818im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hummbug_5249.PNG)\n\n-- so it seems `mkmk` doesn't _really_ work in CS4, while I'm pretty sure it was mentioned as a new feature (perhaps even here on Typophile).  \nI'd be gladly proven wrong. Anyone?\n\n--  \n[Note] For some reason my custom glyph names-per-unicode do not survive the export to PFB/makeOTF trajectory, they never make it into the PFB. Custom names are preferred, because it makes writing the feature file just that bit easier (using \"macroncomb\" and \"opene\" rather than \"uni030F\" and \"uni2011\"). A rather unfortunate side effect is that these glyphs don't appear in Wordpad.\n\n"

Besides, there seems to be no way of knowing which 'number' one particular accent has in its stacking order. `mkmk` accents only have positions relative to the preceding one, and the very first relative to its parent glyph.\n\nThat said, I'm also not sure why there would be a hard-coded limitation in an OTF drawing routine, it could be written as a simple repeating piece of code (at least, that's how I would've done it ;-).\n\nI suspect it's more a bug (or 'feature') in the way type gets blitted; it may be to a buffer restricted to the current font height plus ascenders, something like that. Do Word, Notepad, and Wordpad all use the same drawing APIs? (And -- again, just suspecting -- the answer is likely to be 'yes'.)\n\n"
