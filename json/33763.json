      "content": "kern2VOLT is part of MS VOLT distribution. It allows font designer easily convert existing kern table into file containing kerning data in VOLT lookup format. Once lookup file generated, it can be imported into VOLT project through “Import\\Import Lookup” menu.\n\nCommand line for kern2VOLT is following:\n\n`kern2VOLT [-rtl] fontfile.ttf kernlookup.vtl`\n\nFontfile.ttf should contain kern table and VOLT project sources. VOLT project is required because kern2VOLT needs to get glyph names from there. kernlookup.vtl is name of the output lookup file. -rtl is optional, you would use it to get correct data for right-to-left scripts.\n\nThanks,  \nSergey\n\n"
