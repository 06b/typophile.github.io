Who knows… other freewheeling, DeutscheBahn BahnCard-100–owning typophiles might make it down there, too. Frequent customers like us can ride the ICE trains down to the Basel SBB Bahnhof for free!\n\n"

Yes, Basel is quite accessible from Germany too (and France).  \nPaul, I know at least one person in Basel who might be interested, plus a few people in other areas of Switzerland that might make it down here – I mean Zurich for example is like an hour away. But it would certainly be nice to get more of a Basel-based \"core\" going. Are you connected to the School of Graphic Design (or whatever they call it now)? There should be plenty of typophiles there. But I don't think I know anyone there.  \nIn any case, feel free to drop me an email at altairas\\_eye at mac dot com to discuss things further.\n\n"
