  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have been searching for some elegant slightly informal brush drawn script fonts, but with the unusual specificity of being non-slanted, like the tradition wants.  \nA good example of the \"looks\" I'm searching for is linotype's pepita, but in a less right-slant-look concept. Sadly, for some reason all \"vertical-looking\" brushscript fonts I was given to see looked uneasy and quite in-elegant.(Most probably because they get less curves to express their character).\n\nThanks for any suggestions,\n\nPaul-Kenji Cahier\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks all for the suggestions.  \nThere is this smoothness, clarity yet hand-made brush feeling in pepita that is so hard to find around. The variations in width/alignement are for a good part of that. That and some non-typical forms.\n\nThe one matching the most from what was suggested would be Mr Rafkin:  \n [http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000080](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315225651/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000080 \"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000080\")\n\nI'm particularly fond(in this case) of the caps of pepita, like the 'P'.\n\nAnyway, all suggestions are still welcome.\n\nEdit:  \nOn a side note, I'm liking a lot the looks of gizmo(even if not what I need in this case), it's really nice to see such an informal yet elegant face.\n\n"
