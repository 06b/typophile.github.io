  "content": "Well, for lack of a better term. I might be suffering from the recency illusion, but I could swear here in Spain more typefaces than in the US use an S which has a straight or positive slope mid section, leaving white space in the top left and bottom right sections.\n\nIt seems to be more of a hand-written flourish (or display face characteristic) as I've never seen it used in body text, but I was wondering if anyone else has noticed it before, and if there are any design suggestions/ideals for it?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/costanilladelosangeles_4321.jpg)\n\n(also this shows a nice LL, DE lig with the resizing and repositioning of letters to fill in white space common around here, full text is \"Costanilla de los Ángeles\", a street sign from downtown Madrid. sorry for the low quality, didn't have but my phone's camera)\n\n",
