  "content": "I’m looking for a serif typeface that is as thorough as TheSerif or PMN Caecilia — i.e., multiple weights, small caps, true italics, ranging figures, etc — but that isn’t TheSerif or PMN Caecilia. I can’t use TheSerif (long story why) and I can’t shake the feeling that PMN Caecilia is just a bit too precious (humanist) for this particular use. I’m tending toward slab(ish) serifs, but open to other suggestions, too. Any thoughts?\n\n [‹ clean, fresh, ultra light sans ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829115347/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27522 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Best cut of Clarendon? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829115347/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27512 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
