  "content": "Hey all,\n\nThis is my first post. Been lurking around these parts for a while, figured this would be the best place to get thoughtful, constructive feedback from some really bright people. Anywho, I'm working on branding a tax and payroll service, starting, naturally, with the logo. I'm meeting the client in about two and a half hours, so I thought I'd post something real quick to get some last minute opinions!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [reliant.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320151759/http:/typophile.com/files/reliant.jpg) | 83.27 KB |\n\n",

Maybe instead of having 100% white walls you could colour them in some very light blue colour.\n\nOr change the symbol because all they say is probably: corporate, big firms, financial, low trust. Just my opinion.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
