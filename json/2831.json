  "content": "This is a logo I've designed for my own freelance graphic design/illustration work. My concept is that I'm comparing myself to a Ronin, Japanese for a samurai without a master, working for hire, in that I work for myself, for hire. I wanted to convey a clean, stylish, modern look with a bit of a Japanese/Asian feel.   \n   \nI'm mainly using the top version, however I made the bottom two in case I wanted to use a more compact, less horizontal version of the logo. How do you feel about multiple versions of logos? Is this ok, or is it something that's frowned upon? I'd appreciate your feedback. Thanks.   \n   \n ![Ronin Graphics Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017092006im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/24821.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for the comments. Personally, I think only the capital R and G have a slight asian feel. My intent was not to make it overtly japanese/asian, but to give it just that little touch to reflect the name as well as to represent my personal tastes (being a fan of asian aesthetics, both traditional and modern).   \n   \nAs far as the concept going over people's heads...it wasn't that important to me that people be immediately familiar with the term \"ronin\", however, I plan to incorporate the definition and its relation to me, in things such as the mission statement/website/etc. I like the name because it gets people asking about its meaning.   \n   \nAlso, how do people feel about using variations on a logo...or is it a strict policy of choosing one and sticking with it?\n\n"

And I think Chris has struck a very nice balance between cliche and too-subtle. Those letters are not the rancid \"chop suey\" style, but they look nicely comptemporary-Japanese. A little frivolous though.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

If you have many methods of working through a design or work with many styles several logos might suit you better than one.   \n   \nOverall I would say that is is more important that the attitude you convey be consistent than the particular logo you use.   \n   \nThis is especially true if you market yourself in a personalised, direct fashion than if you just pepper the local papers with adverts.\n\n"

This was a huge trend that came and went, so you may be creating associations you don't want. It's a bit more subtle than [CS Takahashi](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017092006/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cs-takahashi/), but that's the first association my mind makes, along with the Playstation game series [Wipeout](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017092006/http:/www.kleber.net/wipeout3/history/2097/).   \n   \nAlthough, looking at [your work](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017092006/http:/www.ronin-graphics.com/), I see that you tend towards lush, fast, young graphics anyway, so these associations could work in your favor. I recommend being more consistent with your use of the one-line logotype on your site. Personally, I'd replace the Ronin Graphics header that follows the splash page, which looks bland next to your personalized version.   \n   \nBy they way, _Hellboy_ rules. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017092006im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

As for weather you can use the symbol in different ways the answer is of course you can. Different media, require the flexibility for change. A business card is a different environment than a web page. But, make sure you use it consistantly in the media of choice. If you stack it for a business card, always stack it for a business card.
