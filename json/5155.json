It's on a very old German stockpaper from 1922.   \nDoes anyone know what font this is, and if it is still in use.   \nOtherwise I see it as my job to revive it from the dead.   \n   \n ![German stockpaper](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524130232im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37936.jpg)   \n   \nThanks,   \n�en�\n\n",
