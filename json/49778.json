  "content": "Hi all, I'm partly redesigning a historical periodical. A friend suggested Tankard's [Kingfisher](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018040130/http:/www.typography.net/type/font/kingfisher) for body text. In my opinion a great – conservative but fresh – original design. But is has no true small caps, which I really need – and will be using a lot. To automate small caps by using a character style is not an option.\n\nSo any suggestions would be more than welcome.  \nThanks in advance, Brieck.\n\n",

How close does it need to be to Kingfisher? Can you say more about the periodical this is for?\n\n-- K.\n\n"

Also the osf figures, I think, come out very well. The few pages I received and printed just made a fresh impression and looked quite elegant.  \nAs to the periodical; the main focus lies on Dutch imperial and colonial history.\n\nThanks, Brieck\n\n"
