The link to it from [www.typebase.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20121231211758/http:/www.typebase.com/ \"www.typebase.com\") no longer seems to work, but there are other gems within their education section. There is also a topic page for kerning at Ellen Lupton's [www.thinkingwithtype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20121231211758/http:/www.thinkingwithtype.com/ \"www.thinkingwithtype.com\"). Not interactive, but informative. The essential thing is that negative space between characters should appear optically even, rather than mathematically equal.\n\n"
