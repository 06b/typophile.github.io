  "content": "I'm interested in a combo that includes a basic set of pens or whatever, and a text that will take me from beginners' exercises to working on some serious letterforms before sending me out on my own. I've decided I want to get that sense of how the strokes go from thin to thick and vice versa.\n\nOh, something I've been meaning to ask about ... I'm a lefty. Do I have to jump thru hoops figuring out the reverse of instructions from one of these books? Or is it just the same moves with the other hand?\n\n",

      "content": "Pilot Parallel are good starter pens (in fact pretty good full stop) since the nibs are created with two parallel plates, rather than a more recognisable nib, I would imagine they would suit a lefty as much as a righty.  \n [http://www.studioartshop.com/acatalog/info\\_672\\_1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417115258/http:/www.studioartshop.com/acatalog/info_672_1.html \"http://www.studioartshop.com/acatalog/info\\_672\\_1.html\")\n\nIt seems Rotring have dropped their lefthanded range, but there maybe something on ebay or in a dusty stockroom somewhere, the righthanded versions are lovely to use but a little sterile in the quality of their line, depends what you want from your calligraphy.  \n [http://www.blotspens.co.uk/acatalog/Calligraphy\\_Rotring\\_Art\\_Pens\\_22.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417115258/http:/www.blotspens.co.uk/acatalog/Calligraphy_Rotring_Art_Pens_22.html \"http://www.blotspens.co.uk/acatalog/Calligraphy\\_Rotring\\_Art\\_Pens\\_22.html\")\n\nOr there are specialist lefthanded sites – I don’t know about the quality of instruction and pens but they are written with the lefthanded in mind.  \n [http://www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/master\\_class\\_calligraphy\\_s...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417115258/http:/www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/master_class_calligraphy_set.html \"http://www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/master\\_class\\_calligraphy\\_set.html\")\n\n[http://www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/left\\_hand\\_calligraphy.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417115258/http:/www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/left_hand_calligraphy.html \"http://www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/left\\_hand\\_calligraphy.html\")\n\n[http://www.clas.co.uk/lefthanders.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417115258/http:/www.clas.co.uk/lefthanders.html \"http://www.clas.co.uk/lefthanders.html\")\n\nBy the way has anyone used a Yoropen? They look like fun, I am sure I saw a similar product designed for a competition by Seymour Powell.  \n [http://www.yoropen.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417115258/http:/www.yoropen.com/ \"http://www.yoropen.com/\")\n\nTim\n\n"
