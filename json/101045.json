  "content": "Dear Forum\n\nI am very brand new to this.\n\nI really wish to create a PROPER Yiddish font, since i type a whole lot in that language.\n\nI won't go into details now.\n\nI am trying to use Font Creator to make the font.\n\nBut I have a whole lot of problems.\n\nI want to use the font with Microsoft Word\n\nI need a lot of help, especially with the left to right - right to left problem.\n\nI have no trouble creating the glyphs I need. They are based on a simple  \nHebrew font with about 10-15 additional glyphs, which are used only  \nin Yiddish.\n\nI do not need any Latin characters, but I want to be able to use both  \nupper case and lower case to create the needed new glyphs\n\nIf you think you can help me,  \nI would VERY MUCH  \nlike to have somebody as a kind of mentor to get me through this.\n\nI am willing to spend a lot of time with this, but I need some direction,  \nespecially at first.\n\nContact me at\n\n[caspari@tx.technion.ac.il](mailto:caspari@tx.technion.ac.il)\n\nI will surely reply to any responses,\n\nThanks a lot\n\nDavid Tal\n\nHaifa, Israel.\n\n",

      "content": "I want to wish you success on your project and share some ideas. Creating a proper meshet font will also help those of us trying to OCR old documents. I've been wanting to help make such a font for a while and I'm happy to help any way I can, so long as your work is open source.\n\nFirst, I urge you to develop this font with an open-source license, so as to permit others to easily collaborate and build on your work. Here's an example of an excellent open-source font license, the [GPL+FE](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317091443/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL%2BFE)\n\nLikewise, I think you will be able to learn much from the work of other open source Hebrew fontographers. Have you heard of the [Culmus Project](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317091443/http:/culmus.sourceforge.net/)? Maxim Iorsh and Yoram Gnat are two open source Hebrew fontographers in Israel. Yoram in particular helped me out with a Rashi font. Let me know if you need any help making contact with them.\n\n"
