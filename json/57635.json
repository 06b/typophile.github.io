The thing is that i'm looking for font that has more monospaced look ( especially \"wider\" look in italics that are important to me ) that can be found in Foudndry Sterling or Precous Sans. Also I'm looking that letter \"a\" is more proportional.\n\nLike these ex in Sterling:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018014851im_/http:/typophile.com/files/f1_5995.jpg)\n \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018014851im_/http:/typophile.com/files/f1_a_5162.jpg)\n\nOr Precious:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018014851im_/http:/typophile.com/files/p1_6692.jpg)\n \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018014851im_/http:/typophile.com/files/p1_a_6449.jpg)\n\n"
