And then I was let go with a \"we'll call you\" talk...\n\nAnyways, someone mentioned unemployment to me recently, and I'm curious if any of you have applied for / gotten it?\n\nI was technically freelancing, but they the company I was working for took out all the taxes from my weekly paychecks and I worked in house 5 days a week.\n\nIs this something someone here has done? Should I pursue it?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

If you don't receive anything in the mail, you can contact/visit your local government employment office to see if you qualify. It is OK to work while on unemployment, you simply need to report your wages/earnings and let them figure out what you qualify for. Of course, the more you make, the less unemployment you will get.\n\nAlso, if you were freelancing, your employer/client might not have been paying for unemployment benefits (in which case, you would have no claim).\n\n"

If the IRS classifies you as an employee but the employer didn't pay all the taxes and benefits (including unemployment) that they should have, the employer could face fines and penalties.\n\nThe IRS has good information on their website.\n\nMy take is (and this is only MY OPINION): if you really need the unemployment, contact your state labor board or the IRS to ask if you were an employee. (There is a form to file if you need to report the company.) If you prefer to keep the client relationship and can get by without unemployment, don't.\n\n\\*Employees have employers, freelancers have clients.\n\n"

It's a tough economy out there. I spent a greater portion of this year unemployed as well.
