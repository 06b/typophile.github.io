Im using an [HP Laserjet 5200](http://web.archive.org/web/20081206132720/http:/h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/en/WF06b/18972-18972-3328059-14638-236263-1137934-1137935-1137940.html) which is really good, but makes type slightly whispy (thiner than offset). Good for proofing designs, probably not so good for proofing type though.\n\n"

Slower than the latest iteration but these days speed is relative.\n\nI had considered an Xante, for a number of reasons, including film processing (at 2400dpi), but specimens that were sent by the company revealed an awful lot of toner scatter, and since I was mainly interested in camera ready reproduction (back in 2000) I opted for the HP. Actually, can’t say I regret it. At an institution where I teach they have an Xante with film capacity (actually on my recommendation) and they have a lot of software connection problems with it plus repair maintenance is unbelievably expensive.\n\nPlus, even with 2400dpi and film capacity, the Xante still can’t anywhere come near the quality of an imagesetter.\n\nGerald\n\n"

Sigh.\n\nI have also heard from a few other designers that they are having problems with new HP cartridges printing ’wispy’ type. Be interesting to know if anyone else is having the same problems.\n\n—K\n\n"
