I know it's a stupid question but help me out here?\n\nthank you :-)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Times Modern \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062517/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [\\_.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062517/http:/typophile.com/files/_.png) | 762.2 KB |\n\n",
