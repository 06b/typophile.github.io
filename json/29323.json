My heterodox opinion is that Carter could have gone much further. (And where are the bold and bold italic? Only a \"street\" version, somewhat but not quite fully bolder, appears on the website.) His differences are fascinating, of course--slight overall condensing, adjusted x-height, and above all, a smoothing away of many of the most charming kinks--e.g., on the capital K--instead of adding \\*more\\* kinks as, say, Dupré might have done with the same assignment. But these differences don't add up to anything fresh, transcending the source material, as Galliard did. Yale is certainly entitled to their own more \"formal\" Bembo, but if it went on the market, I would see no point to getting it. I speak as a type consumer, not a type designer.\n\n"

The first poster asked whether Carter's Yale fonts were available to the public, which implies a second question: if they were, would they be worth acquiring? My answer to both is no. The prospect of Carter taking a fresh look at Bembo is profoundly exciting, especially since Morison's 1929 is the only version extant. We don't know what his client specified, but the Yale tweaking is deeply disappointing relative to the type market, and I hope Carter could still revisit Bembo with more creative effect. There is a market demand to revive older pre-Morison Bembos, delving deeper into the Renaissance source material for a funkier, more charming result, more like a Dupré face.\n\n"

I'm too young to tell) of the standard MT Bembo and its offsprings.\n\n\\<rant\\>  \nHell, Tufte even had his own Bembo made because the commercially available ones are mostly crummy.\n\nAs for a bold, or even a --shudder-- bold italic: What are you thinking? Did Manuce have a bold italic? Does anyone _need_ bold italics? We would live in a much better world if it weren't for bold italics!  \n\\</(h)rant\\>\n\n"

      "content": "Tufte had a digital Bembo made for his later offset work, probably because he was accustomed to having books set in Monotype metal Bembo by Michael and Winnie Bixler (for offset repro, no less). He has the same prejudice we all have: \"Metal Bembo is so great, why is the digital so weak?\" and he knew metal Bembo.\n\nOne partial answer to that complaint is the new, OpenType Bembo Book, which Robin Nicholas based on a different size master than the earlier digital version. It's stronger.\n\n"
