There’s some funky stuff going on in the negative space, and a lot of it looks accidental. That probably helps the impression that there doesn’t seem to be much conscious interaction/interconnection between the two elements, and that the type is just sitting there on top of the blades.  \nMaybe consider overlapping, too, to hurt the type less? :-)\n\n"

They liked the ’grassy’ logo, but we all felt it was too far removed from both the word association w/ ’sawhorse’ and from their actual business — building simple, no-frills web applications from scratch.\n\nThis concept won them over because it references d.i.y. construction, coding, and a rough gesture of a sawhorse.\n\n"
