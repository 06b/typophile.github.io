Should be modern but still a bit conservative, quiet/clean, well readable ... I think I would fancy the whiteman/Kent Lew font ...   \n   \nAny suggestions?   \n   \nAnd than I would like to show you a logo I did a few years ago. Its a typologo for a media solutions company.   \n   \nWhat do you think?   \n   \nCu beck ![logo moccabeans](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310065320im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33130.gif)\n\n",
