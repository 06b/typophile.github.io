  "content": "Hello there. New to the board. Would love to get some last minute feedback from you folks.   \n   \nThis is going to print in various forms on Monday. Any last minute adjustments would be greatly appreciated.   \n   \nI have some thoughts but I don't want to bias your replies. Looking for thoughts on kerning, letterforms, serif treatment, overall aesthetic.   \n   \nThanks in advance. ![Amicus logotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804191108im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10892.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "With the unique qualities found in the larger, wedge serifs, perhaps you should see if you can somehow incorporate more of a wedge-like serif on the C and S -- those two seem to be naked compared to the others. You might also consider removing the sharp apexes, rounding them slightly. Maybe dulling down all the sharp points throughout just a hair. Maybe rendering it a bit more hammered and chiseled. \\>\\>\\> just thoughts. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804191108im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

YOur guides may show that they are, but if they don't go below (slightly) the same baseline as the \"ami\" they would seem slightly above it, because they are curved letters...just a thought....\n\n"

I think it should be smaller. I agree with Tiffany about heavier serifs at C and S. I hope we will see the new version soon. It could be a nice piece.\n\n"

In other words, make the thicks a bit thicker instead of thickening up the thins. ah!   \n   \n[] Not sure if this has been suggested, but what if the U were a V?? Silly idea?   \n   \n[] Serifs are much improved. However, the C and S continue to seem a bit small in the serifs. But, I'm not sure how to fix them. :^\\\n\n"
