      "content": "Basically, never ever stack it. Most likely you won't be using a fixed-width typeface, so the letters won't align at all, and readability will go right down the tubes. Set the text just as you would, then rotate it 90°… Which direction you choose to rotate it is more up to you, but generally, it looks better if the baseline is facing the edge of your interface.\n\n"
