I do know some history behind black letter, but I was wondering which would be the best to show the overall characteristics? I am thinking something like Goudy Text. Possibly Fette?\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Courtney,\n\nstrictly speaking, not every [Blackletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516172517/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter) is a [Fraktur](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516172517/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fraktur). According to the DIN [Scheme](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516172517/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typeface%20Classification%20Schemes), those typefaces could be classified into [five subcategories](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516172517/http:/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_16518#Gruppe_X:_Gebrochene_Schriften).\n\nGoudy Text is, as its name suggests, a [Textura](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516172517/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Textura), which is the oldest branch of Blackletter. Then again, this very typeface was designed as recently as in the 1920s.\n\nSo is [Wilhelm-Klingspor-Gotisch](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516172517/http:/www.linotype.com/1608/wilhelmklingsporgotisch-family.html), a Textura by [Rudolf Koch](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516172517/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Rudolf%20Koch). That one would be my suggestion: It is one the most beautiful Blackletter typefaces. And, IMHO, it is more representative in some details. Compare the letters ‘d’, ‘h’, ‘z’, ‘A’ etc. You’ll see that Goudy Text is more normalised, less ‘quintessentially Blackletter’.  \nF\n\n"

It is an exceptional Blackletter.\n\nMichael\n\n"
