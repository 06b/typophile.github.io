And although we ask for member contributions, we don’t require a fee to join. However, we view a Typophile affiliation as a signal of where your personal and professional interests lie and we feel a public LinkedIn group is one way for people to get direct value from the Typophile community as a networking vehicle.\n\nSo, while we don’t expect a lot of discussion on LinkedIn — we expect that to continue on the boards at Typophile.com — we do hope this will foster better networking among Typophiles.\n\n",
