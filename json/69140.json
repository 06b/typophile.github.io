What can I do to resolve this problem? Or it's impossible?\n\n",

Identify the beginning of a word not by presence of space but by absence of letters:\n\n@anyLetter = [a b c ...];  \nignore sub @anyLetter b';  \nsub b' b.alt;\n\nThis makes it easier to deal with different spaces, punctuation marks, numbers, currency symbols, math symbols, etc.  \nIn case you do _not_ want to see the b-to-b.alt replacement if, for example, a period precedes the word, then simply include period in the @anyLetter class.\n\n"
