It is most definately gotham. The R is a little longer, which I find very characteristic. To be more specific, Gotham Bold (gotham medium pictured above in my example).\n\n"

I was referring to the cover lines, and should have been more specific.\n\nLooks like the logo’s gone through a few iterations over the years.
