May be mixing some of these ones would be interesting: [Highway](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/youngjerks.com/#/highway-typeface) (flare serif but overall design looks in the same vein), [Wyvern](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/wyvern), [Railroad Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/railroad-gothic-rr), [Maxwell Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/kimmy/maxwell-sans), [CA Aires](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/capearcona/ca-airespro), [Strassenbahn](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.tendollarfonts.com/strassenbahn), [Route 66](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/route-66-nf), [Outer Loop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/outer-loop-nf), [SNV](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/snv), [Highway](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/highway) (Blue Highway, Highway Gothic, Interstate, Expressway...), [Signal](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/font/T1052/signal), [SAA](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/saa), [Monod](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/monod), [Nomad](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/coniglio/nomad), [Cougher](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/context/cougher), [Van Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/rsantos/van-condensed), [Inventory](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/inventory), [Station](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017184902/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/kimmy/station)\n\n"
