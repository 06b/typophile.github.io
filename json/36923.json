Cos I really didn’t get a chance to talk to you much. And you went through the trouble of making the reservations too. Thanks for that. We would never have gotten in without reservations.\n\nStewf, are you back in SF yet?\n\nHehe, and I look like I’m doing something dubious with my nose in that photo.\n\nI wonder if any typophile is coming to Singapore anytime soon. Always nice to meet with fellow type lovers.\n\n"

We walked past the library and the City Hall, and found that it wasn’t as bad as we expected.\n\nStewf, my timing’s off I guess. Was hoping to catch you again but today’s my last day in SF. Well, be sure to email me if you’re going to be in Singapore. Thanks for the goodies!\n\n"
