  "content": "The UK Research Council’s Energy Programme has announ-ced funding of £5.25m for a study of energy-efficient heating and cooling technologies.\n\nThe research will be carried out by the Interdisciplinary Centre for Storage, Transformation and Upgrading of Thermal Energy, which will be known as i-STUTE.\n\nThe University of Warwick will play a leading role in the project, working alongside London South Bank, Loughborough and Ulster universities.\n\ni-STUTE director Professor Bob Critoph told H&V News the intention is to outline a strategy that will be easily understandable for consumers that will also “allow suppliers to make money”.\n\nHe stated that i-STUTE was already speaking to companies such as Dimplex, Emerson and all the major boiler manufacturers.\n\n“We want to identify something that’s universally acceptable,” said Prof Critoph, explaining that the four partners had already carried out work in a number of complementary areas.\n\n“In many ways this follows on from the work we did within CALEBRE [Consumer-Appealing Low Energy technologies for Building Retrofitting],” Prof Critoph said, adding that this would allow the project to “hit the ground running”.\n\nHe also revealed that there would be a focus on studying air-to-water and gas-absorption heat pumps.\n\nThe four partners are due to sign legal documents to confirm their involvement by 1 June.\n\nThe project will run for five years and be able to diverge its studies if necessary.\n\n",
