His is a unique new voice, and we’re very excited about this design and the other types Kris has in development. (You can expect more designs before the end of the year.)\n\nhttp://vllg.com/KLIM/Feijoa/mudTyper+Weights/\n\n/ / / / /\n\nFor Like Ever-er\n\nShow your undying love with one of our “For Like Ever” products.
