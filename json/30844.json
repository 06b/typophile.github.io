For example, [FF Bau](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104142655/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11312.1.5) has most of the same physical structure, but it is not as condensed. It is also $40/weight. Is that too high?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
