  "content": "There was a pile of bricks sitting in the front yard. I have no idea why they're there, but they have been there forever. I have to design a typeface, so I thought that using the bricks for that would be pretty neato. So I made all 26 letters (sorry, no symbols or anything...yet) and took photos and edited them down to where they would be simple enough to use practically. I'm a pretty big fan of block letters, so theres that as well. I haven't finished editing all of the letters, but I have to get something up here now and figure this will at least get the point across, I hope. Please let me know what you think.
