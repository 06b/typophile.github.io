I have also found that Opti Fonts had this under the name of Ogden, but I can't find it online. A lighter weight (bold?) was once distrbuted by NovelFonts under the name of Obbsidda.\n\nThat's all I have been able to find through my notes. Maybe Mike F. has more info on digital versions?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The download includes equivalents to Modula Light, Bold and XB (there was a medium weight to Modula too).\n\n2) [Modularity](http://web.archive.org/web/20140425005626/http:/fontsfordesign.com/previews/modular.html) from [Doug Olena/Keystrokes](http://web.archive.org/web/20140425005626/http:/fontsfordesign.com/preview.html).\n\nNeither matches the image exactly, but it's the image's characters that have been altered from Modula - especially the c and C - not the fonts.\n\nOh, and [Castcraft](http://web.archive.org/web/20140425005626/http:/www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html) likely still will sell you their version, but their customer service, er, lacks enthusiam, shall we say?\n\n"
