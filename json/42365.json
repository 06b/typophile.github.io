  "content": "Hello,\n\nI tried the search function to find an old thread without success. We discussed a Font Management program that produces a new license order form when a user attempts to access a font in excess of the license. Can anyone track down the thread for me?\n\nMegacorporation is looking into purchasing a font management system so we can better track our font usage and ensure the proper licensing of our fonts. Are any of you using a Font Management system that works well? Any systems I should avoid?\n\nI talked to Halstead York about this way back during the Boston Typecon and he was kind enough to donate a copy the tech team could play with, so we will definitely be communicating with Extensis.\n\nThanks,\n\nKristin\n\n [‹ Not a Mac vs. PC question](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821153501/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42225 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typo synth in action ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821153501/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42375 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
