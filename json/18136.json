      "content": "In the Dover book “Treasury of Authentic Art Nouveau Alphabets” (which is a partial reprint of a German type specimen book from 1903), there is a face called “Studley Extended” which, except for the proportions, looks almost exactly like your sample. It has many similar details, such as the hook serif on the G and the way the diagonal meets the right stem of the N just above the baseline. According to the Dover book, it was produced by the Inland Type Foundry, but I can’t find any other references to it. I would have expected to see it in Mac McGrew’s American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, but maybe it was too old even for that.\n\n"

      "content": "Studley was named for [Robert P. Studley](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Robert%252BStudley), the first user of lithographic presses in Saint Louis. It was said to be only a modification of [Woodward](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Woodward). Extended, Condensed, and Extra Condensed versions would follow within four years. While [Inland](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Inland%252BType%252BFoundry) claimed this was original work, [McGrew](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mac%252BMcGrew) claims that it was just a copy of Quentell/Taylor Gothic/Globe Gothic. McGrew in general shows little trust in Inland and denounces its claims of originality in many cases. Eckman showcases Inland’s its aggressive salesmanship and bullying tactics.\n\nMcGrew about Studley: [Globe Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Globe%252BGothic) is a refinement of Taylor Gothic, designed about 1897 by [ATF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ATF) at the suggestion of Charles H. Taylor of the Boston Globe, and used extensively by that paper. But Taylor Gothic has mostly the same lowercase as [Quentell](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Quentell), though with hairlines heavied a bit. ATF’s Central Type Foundry branch in St. Louis claims to have originated Quentell (q.v.) in 1895 or earlier. The conversion to Taylor Gothic was designed by [Joseph W. Phinney](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Joseph%252BW.%252BPhinney), while the redesign as Globe Gothic in about 1900 is credited to [Morris Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Morris%252BBenton). It is a serifless, thick-and-thin face, distinguished by the high crossbar on E, F, and H. The angular end on the stems of V, W, and most lowercase letters. Globe Gothic Condensed, Extra Condensed, and Extended were designed by Benton about 1900. Globe Gothic Bold and its italic are also credited to Benton, in 1907 and 1908 respectively. But [Frederic W. Goudy](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frederic%252BW.%252BGoudy), in the book on his typefaces, says, “This type (Globe Gothic Bold), drawn at the suggestion of Joseph Phinney, followed in the main certain points which he wished brought out. It never had much vogue and is the least satisfactory (to me) of all my types.” This is puzzling, as the bold departs somewhat from the style of the lighter weights, but is not at all characteristic of Goudy’s work-nor of Benton’s, for that matter. Studley of Inland Type Foundry was similar. Compare Ryerson Condensed, Radiant, Matthews, Pontiac, World Gothic.\n\nhttp[:]//cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/inland/\n\n"
