I mean, everyone says what’s listening to while working, but they do the same on music forums.\n\nWhat was interesting was the association proposed at the thread’s beginning: what’s the relationship between your design and the music you relate to it.\n\nPersonally I did often in the past the opposite: I played certain things as I worked on early creative stages of alphabets. I recall I did it with Neoritmo: since the face was a destructured/restructured approach to the classic lapidary/roman framework, I played alternatively traditional rock and pop, as well as things evocating the Roman Empire in modern context. Examples which could apply:\n\nKilling Joke - Rubicon (and the whole “Brighter…” album)  \nIggy Pop - American Caesar  \nPsychic TV - Slur  \nSigue Sigue Sputnik - How do U Dream Little Caesar  \nMorcheeba - Rome Wasn’t Built in A Day  \nAnthrax - American Pompeii  \nCulture - Roman Soldiers of Babylon  \nand so on…\n\nI did the same with a face I have not released as well, recently. The thing is very very destructured and meant to convey a sense of the future, so I played an album I just discovered (in 2004), which is The Human League’s debut album “Reproduction” from 1979.  \nIf you are used to the “crappy” pop done by Phil Oakley in mid-1980s you should check the original first two albums of the band, which convey an unsurpassed sense of “the future”.  \n“Black Celebration” by Depeche Mode would have been equally suited. A masterpiece of a concept album. Considered it’s from 1986, it’s optimistic considered what we live right now.\n\n"

He always smoked me, but it was an honor that he would play off some of my licks. And he taught me to appreciate things I hadn’t got into before, like quartile riffs. One he liked to repeat was three rapid ascending fourths, then go up a half-step and do three more, then another half-step and do three more, then resolve it with a rapid minor-third trill. He’d repeat it until I whistled it right. A truely patient teacher.\n\n"
