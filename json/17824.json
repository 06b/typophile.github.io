  "content": "_ **KEYWORDS:**  \nOlympic Games visual identity, Olympic Games corporate identity, Olympic logos, Olympic emblems, Olympic mascots, Olympic sport pictograms, Olympic sport pictographs, Olympic information pictograms, spectator signs and symbols, Olympic typography, wayfinding system, Olympic signage, Olympic marks, Look of the Games, Olympic posters, Olympic medal, Olympic torch_\n\nHi, everybody!!!\n\nThis is Panos Koutsodimitropoulos. On 2002, I did my MA on **'Olympic Sport Pictograms'** and ever since then I try to collect as mush info as I can regarding all the visual elements of Olympic Games. My aim is to create an educational web site, in which there will be all the info for **'Olympic Games visual identity'**. Everything that is related to Olympic Games' visual elements and you happen to know or heard about it may be very valuable to my research.\n\nThe final web site will present for every modern Olympiad the following:\n\n**a) the basic visual elements**\n\n- Emblems (bid, main, secondary ones for: environment, culture, volunteerism, torch relay)\n- Mascots (in sport action, variations)\n- Sports and information pictograms\n- Pattern (in [http://www.athens2004.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308045705/http:/www.athens2004.com/ \"http://www.athens2004.com\") is called 'secondary graphics' and in [http://www.torino2006.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308045705/http:/www.torino2006.org/ \"http://www.torino2006.org\") is called 'Look of the Games')\n- Typography\n- Colours\n\n**b) design applications, such as:**\n\n- Wayfinding\n- Posters\n- Medal\n- Torch\n- Web site\n- Print items\n\nSo, any help is welcomed. You could help me by giving me reference for: an article that you have read concerning Olympic Games visual identity, a book that contains similar data, digital files and anything you may think off. If you want to send me digital files, please use my e-mail: [pkoutsod@gmail.com](http://web.archive.org/pkoutsod@gmail.com).\n\nThanks is advance. The project will be done inside 2006. So, stay tuned!!!\n\n:-)\n\nPanos Koutsodimitropoulos\n\n",
