  "content": "Here is a preview of an extensive revision of \"Shark,\" an old typeface of mine. I started it a few years ago as a hybrid between blackletter and roman, before I knew anything about blackletter. The revision has ligatures, alternate characters, upper and lowercase numerals, small caps, Cyrillic and Greek alphabets, and the kerning and metrics have been fixed.\n\nLet me know what you think. Should I keep working on it? I'm especially interested in feedback from people familiar with blackletter typography.\n\n-matt\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222450im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sample2_1.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sample-revised.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222450/http:/typophile.com/files/sample2_0.pdf) | 355.8 KB |\n| [sample2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222450/http:/typophile.com/files/sample2_3.png) | 124.49 KB |\n\n",

On one maybe it stays the same on another maybe you move it 20 points down on another 22 on a yet another 5 etc.\n\nThe variation may give you a richer more interesting feeling, and you may be able to make better letters that way too.\n\nFor instance my guess is that the i could maybe stay the same whereas the r will benefit from a lower angle.\n\nAnother thing I saw was that the lc s looks a little thin compared to the other glyphs. Maybe the middle can be fatter.\n\n"

      "content": "It's little details like the top of the arm of the r. At smal sizes you might not notice but big you can see that the curve is lumpy. The bottom of the e and it's end need a little more weight. The aldine style diagonal on the echoed in the s is a different angle from the diagonal cut of the descenders. I wonder if it would be good to reduce it in the descenders to that of the s & e. The s falls over backwards. It needs a wider base. I wonder if the r would benefit from starting the crotch of the r deeper down. What if the s had it's terminals out just a little more so the end s might be heavier? What about lettering the ascenders be a little taller? I think that might make the face read better & help make the teeth at the bottom less of an impediment to reading. The bottom of the d seems like a make do solution. In general it is the joins on the letters that need the most help. Look at Cooper Black and maybe the bold weight of DTL Fleischmann, and Freight.\n\n[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Fleischmann\\_rdrct.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222450/http:/www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Fleischmann_rdrct.html \"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Fleischmann\\_rdrct.html\")\n\n(pull the the weight\n\n[http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222450/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext.php \"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext.php\")\n\nI might comment further but I don't have a full glyph set with the cut-ball terminals.\n\nOn some level it's a spit & polish thing. Are all the details the way you want them? Obviously you don't have to do any of this. You may decide that I am mistaken which is quite possible. Or that it's good enough. But what I like about the face is that it's outrageous but it nearly works - very well. I see potential. The ball terminal for instance work better than I thought - even. I would hate to see it be less than it can be. If you are sick of it maybe put it away & come back... But that's just my 2.5 cents.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n"
