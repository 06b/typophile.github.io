I just love it!\n\n[http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018233110/http:/www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights \"http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights\")\n\nI am actually looking for a similar typeface (with what some might call a \"nice and 'trendy' modern sans design\") that includes cyrillic glyphs, with a wide variety of weights (especially light or thin).\n\nAny suggestions ? :)\n\n",
