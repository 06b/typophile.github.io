So firstly, thank you for being amazing people.\n\nI had a question that has been bothering me for a good long while.\n\nHave any of you ever encountered a typeface in a film or other work that did not belong in the setting's time period? Especially if it just wasn't invented during the era in the film?\n\n",

As I said in an other thread, don't put a glyphic roman typeface on a movie about Egyptian mummies (The Mummy) or on a movie about a 1912 British ship (Titanic).\n\nI don't really agree with Mark Simonson when he says the title on a movie poster doesn't have to be contextual. Indeed the rules are not as strict as on in-movie typography, but selecting a glyphic roman typeface to represent everything surrounding the RMS Titanic is just ignorant.

For such a high profile, critically acclaimed film, I honestly expected more. I don't think the surprised expression has left my brow yet.\n\nI simply do not understand why one would not enlist the help of a professional typographer to make things accurate. Even without, google is more than helpful when it comes to choosing a proper typeface. Just as they research costumes and the like, so, too, should they research typefaces.\n\nBut I guess google searches (like dystopias and accurate science) are too hard for some movie-makers to accomplish.

Designed more than 20 years after the the series time period begins, it's an expression of the sophisticated tastes of Upstairs at Downton Abby in a way that speaks more clearly to modern viewers than alternative typefaces from the immediate pre Great War period, which might be distracting because they are generally unknown or seem quaint to the modern eye.  \nBTW Trajan is the Comic Sans of contemporary movies with a historical theme.

I can't completely agree with that. For some reason we became accustomed to the idea that in-movie typography needs to be contextual while the typography on the movie only needs to be aesthetically pleasing, but that's very different from arguing that this should be the case objectively. There is logic in placing the typography in the movie in the correct time and setting of the movie, but there is also logic in the design of movie posters. A movie poster is a visualization of a mood of the movie and needs to be rationally crafted to communicate exactly that. Arguably the Titanic poster does that, but it's not the most coherent in its message and this could easily be improved with better typography. The typography doesn't necessarily need to be contextually correct in regard to the movie, but it does need to be contextually correct in regard to the mood of the poster, which in turn has a strong relation with the movie. Because, if only aesthetics matter, why not use a magenta background for the poster? Because if magenta is not a prominent color in the movie, the poster doesn't have a clear relationship with the movie. Why would you expect such consistency in color, composition and theme, but not in typography?\n\nJohn, I think in a roundabout way I said just about the same thing as you. I agree with your distinction, but in practice it will always bother me if it doesn't adhere to my logic. This is why I'm not convinced it's an entirely objective matter.\n\n"

I don't think your analogy necessarily applies.\n\n<cite>I don't think that I have such a problem with using typefaces for their aesthetic appeal over historical perfection. It looks really lovely when it's done well.</cite>\n\nDefinitely. I don't think there is anything necessarily wrong with it as long as it's a conscious choice and it's well done. In most cases things go wrong due to ignorance though. I think every movie should have a knowledgeable typographer in their team to make sure the typographic details make sense.\n\n<cite>But costumes, hairstyles, language, and many other things often aren't historically accurate in movies.</cite>  \nIt seems you're using this argument to justify the contextual deviations. I know that costume designers and historians will get just as annoyed and passionate about that as we do about typography. The reason we usually don't notice other inaccuracies is because we're either ignorant on the subject or we're just not passionate about it. Only Neil deGrasse Tyson would have complained about the sky in Titanic being incorrect because he has the knowledge and the passion. Only we would point out all the typographic inaccuracies because we have the knowledge and the passion.\n\n<cite>The director is just trying to evoke a time in history, not necessarily be accurate in every detail.</cite>\n\nThat's a generalization. I think it's often the director's objective to do make it as accurate as possible. When someone in Lord of the Rings is wearing a watch, that's an overlooked mistake and it can't be justified by saying the director was just setting a mood so not all details need to be accurate. They do need to be.\n\n"

I _was_.\n\nWhen one is watching a movie, the ideal is that it should be as if one were viewing _the actual events depicted_, somehow recorded as they were happening in real life.\n\nSo an anachronistic typeface is a continuity failure. And, unlike expecting Hollywood actors to even have their heads shaved, let alone their teeth damaged (hey, but maybe someday we'll be able to do this with CGI), it seems an easily remedied one. I mean, they still will print fake newspapers on laser printers or whatever - setting up stereotype plates with resuscitated Linotype machines and Ludlow machines (doing Bodoni much of the time) is a _little_ too much to expect.\n\nTitles, credits, and even subtitles are the packaging on the box the movie proper came in. When you see a title, you know you're watching a movie - documentaries have titles too, but the title, credits, and subtitles of a documentary _aren't part of what's being documented_.\n\nSo while I'm entirely OK with saying that those typefaces ought to \"belong\", if they're anachronistic, we're not seeing something that's in any sense logically impossible. A bad choice of typeface is simply an aesthetic failure, not a failure of the movie to present to the eyes what it pretends to present to the eyes.\n\nHowever, there is another half to your argument that _is_ valid that I simply skipped over for reasons of space and simplicity in my original post.\n\nPeople watch _stage plays_ for enjoyment. Even when they're performed by _high school students_. Thus, while it is an ideal to present to the eyes the actual events a film depicts, it is not a logical requirement of a well-made film that production values be infinite so as to achieve absolute perfection.\n\nThus, while some fanatical Star Trek fans may disagree with me, one couldn't really expect them to have cloned William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney, and any other actors who would have been required, some 20 years or so before making the current series of Star Trek prequels.\n\nSo I will agree that historically correct typefaces are not an absolute logical necessity for a successful film, if that was your point.\n\n"

It should be correct enough that it doesn't jar the average non-specialist movie goer. But film makers are telling stories so a level of suspended belief should be expected and probably encouraged.\n\nThe opening battle scene in Gladiator was heavily criticised by historians because the Romans never threw their pilla as they advanced, and lost cohesion in the melee... but 98.5% of viewers neither knew or cared and probably weren't interested in being educated. In the same way, it probably wouldn't matter if they used Times New Roman for the title rather than Trajan or a custom imitation of some Roman text off a ruin.
