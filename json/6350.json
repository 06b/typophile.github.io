      "content": "Hi Paul   \n   \n...well this is the best thing to communicate with designers all around the world. I could never meet i greek who designs a logo for a ranch.   \n   \nAnyway my view is that you need to make less lines and more tight composition. I would propose to keep dark the width of the letters (as in your last proposal) and if possible to avoid the inner light of the fire so the flames can just be black and describe the shape of the letters. If you sure need to keep the inner parts of the fire you could maybe use them dark and the outer shape with a fat and calligraphic outline.   \n   \nI realy had a hard time to explain in english what i mean and hope you understood. If not is reasonable why.   \n   \nchristos\n\n"

      "content": "thanks for your comments thust far. let me take a bit of time to respond   \n   \n_I'm not a big fan of the 3D effect. With Adobe Illustrator CS You are going to see alot of cheesy 3D_   \ndarnation! this was my concept before i hoped on illustrator and even knew you could do this 3D thing... maybe i should use my \"3-D\" sketches but i wanted this to be really clean. is 3D really that cheesy? any other opinions? the main thing is that i wanted to give the HX mark some weight when set on an angle, i don't want them feeling flimsy. what would be a good alternative to give weight to the mark? i guess i'm not married to this design, it's just the strongest concept i've come up with so far, but i can do some more brainstorming...   \n   \n_I'm not in love with the campy cowboy HX Brand type, its 2004 not 1864_   \ni was actually shooting for comtemporary but maybe this is too 70s? 2000? instead of 2004. Again I'm not wedded to this type, i just stuck it in there to comp the feel of having a tag there in that spot. i'm not sure if it helps or hinders there. Maybe i'll try to draw some beautiful slab letters like [FB's Dispatch](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052843/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=109345214610152766&fontname=Dispatch) for the tag.   \n   \nChristos:   \nIs this what you meant? if so it's genius! but maybe you had something even more genius in mind. let me know what you think.   \n   \n ![revised B&W](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052843im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47533.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Paul:   \n   \nThis last post is a huge improvement. There is definitely a difference between \"3-D\" and \"cheesy 3-D\", and this last post is not \"cheesy\". You have a much better use of your positive/negative space.   \n   \nBefore seeing your last post, my main comment was going to be that I usually see brands on a more vertical plane (on the side of cattle). I didn't immediately think brand when seeing your graphic. I realize that the branding iron would probably be seen this way, but there is no handle/pole coming from the brand to identify it as the iron.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

      "content": "Scott,   \n   \ni was waiting for you to comment. ;^)   \n   \nMaybe i should clarify a bit better. My whole concept with this logo plays off the word \"brand.\" Yes, this HX mark is my family's brand as in branding iron, but i acutally want to take the mark from the meaning it had in 1864 to the present meaning: \"a trademark or distinctive name identifying a product or manufacturer\"-- Websters (not necessarily a big hunk of metal) That said i want to keep some of the symbolism of the branding iron - thus the flames and the rust-colored HX in the first post. So no one really needs to \"see\" a brand as in a hunk of metal on a post, but i want it to be \"felt.\" does that make any sense?   \n   \noh and thank you for the \"not cheesy\" comment. i feel much better now. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052843im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

A couple of minor comments, the \\ stroke of the X looks a little thin and something about the 3-d effect is slightly off because X doesn't seem to be lying on the same plane as the H. One last thought, personally I'd like to see the mark and the type relate more. Have you tried using the slab serif HX in the flame mark instead of the sans?\n\n"

The only snafu I see (which probably won't be a problem) is many trendy clothing companies do the same with their logosï¿½ place a logo image captioned with \"foo brand\".   \n   \nI actually liked the Western type in #1 better than the one in the SWF; have you tried Clarendon? Also, I agree with Kirsten, there's something funny happening at the join of the H and X.\n\n"
