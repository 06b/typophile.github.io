Ok? Thanks a lot.   \n   \nMH\n\n",

There are some [beautifully inventive ligatures](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042445/http:/www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=142) in there (the \"g\" combinations are wicked!). And it works both in display and text settings.   \n   \n [Cholla Unicase](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042445/http:/www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PChoUL.html) is a fine example of ligatures in a very contemporary setting, and understandably also ships with [Just van Rossum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042445/http:/www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PChoUL.html)'s LigatureMaker.\n\n"

The ct, st, and sp for example are not in use anymore because, due to changing in tastes, most people today find them disruptive in the flow of reading. The sz has been thrown out of modern German, and I haven't seen many examples using the ft and fft-ligatures in Petr van Blokland's Proforma yet.   \n   \nI'll try to post a couple of examples later on.\n\n"
