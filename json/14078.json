      "content": "Hi again,\n\nThanks for the responses. The meaning of level d? To be honest I looked for words that I like the sound of first. The meaning came after. The D is design. And it doesn't hurt that my last name starts with a D. So...combos like Terminal D and Area D came up. I liked the sound of Terminal D but it means the end and although most would associate it with a section of an airport some might think death. In the end I settled on Level D and decided that I liked the various definitions of the word. For example, (adj) Rational and balanced; sensible, or (n) A relative degree, as of achievement, intensity, or concentration and (n) A natural or proper position, place, or stage...\n\nWhere do I want to go with design? I'm currently in a place where I want to explore other arenas of design...work with my hands more. Most of my experience has been with corporate design...newsletters, brochures, books, magazines, identities, etc. So this is a space for me to explore.\n\nAbout solving the problems in black in white first...you're right. I'll work on that and repost with gifs next time. So regarding the comment that I should tell people who I am...are you saying that the word design should be a part of the logo?\n\nI used Din because it looked like it might be used for a parking or street sign. Perhaps I should move away from that aesthetic. I'll definitely explore other options.\n\nThanks again for your help. I'm moving today so I won't be able to show you anything new until the end of the week.\n\n"

I like the various colors that you've applied to the logo. You could actually choose a palette of colors and use them all depending on what section of your portfolio one is reviewing. There are a great number of ways in which you could apply the logo to various touch points.\n\nCriticism:  \nIf it were mine, I would work on the kerning of the word a little more... There is a spacing issue particularity between the v and the first e. I suggest tightening it up a bit. Try squiniting your eyes when looking at the word and keep tightening up the space until it looks coherent to the other letter spacing in the word.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n"

There is equity in your existing name because you have done work under that name already. Also 'starlux' is more memorable than 'level D'. People forget they parked at level D alll the time. What is to stop them from forgetting you? Starlux is memorable. I would suggest redesigning starlux to carry the new feeling you want to evoke.

      "content": "starlux,\n\nI've just read through this critique thread for the first time and I agree with the main themes of this discussion:\n\n- The original is best but would benefit from refinement  \n- Define the problem further to give focus to the process\n\nHonestly, you're straddling a couple of definitions of 'retro' and you should probably pin those down more firmly before moving ahead. Don't design, research (I have to go back to the research all the time).\n\nAre you generally going for 50s retro with chrome lettering and pastel colors, 60s retro with a psychedelic twist? Perhaps late 70s/early 80s neon rock lettering with some glitz and shimmer? Your site seems to drift towards the latter, but the 'Starlux' pushes towards the 50s in my mind's eye. And if you want to blend them, what aspects are you blending and why? Again, immerse yourself in visual research. Get excited and inspired by the rich visual cultures you're referencing and don't worry about websites and logos for a little bit.\n\nBy the way, there's a film called [Lipstick & Dynamite](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143100/http:/www.apple.com/trailers/independent/lipstick_and_dynamite.html) that hits the retro-but-contemporary nail squarely on the head with its titles. Check out [the movie site](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143100/http:/www.lipstickanddynamite.com/). While I think it gets a bit too hip-contemporary for its own good, it's not afraid of some _real_ retro design, incorporating some of the kink, funk, and naiveté of the design from that era. I'm a fan of that [script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143100/http:/www.ruthlessfilms.com/images/index_08.jpg) they use. That's what separates a retro design from a thin retro-rehash.\n\nThis is all probably more helpful for your general design, since it looks like you're focusing on the original script, which I like. I'm eager to see where it all goes. Hope this helps.\n\n"

I was particularly interested in words that mean \"light\" or \"illuminate\", most of which are taken. I thought at the time a tagline that read Illuminating Design would work well (although something about it sounds familiar. I think there was an Illuminating Television tagline for something). And illuminate is a good word because it means to enlighten, clarify, reveal...all of which are important in design.\n\nSo...I arrived at lux...which was the favorite of all the words I came up with. Another design company in the bay area has it so I didn't take it on. But I did combine lux with other words. One day I wrote luxstar. Took a look at it and thought Starlux!\n\nAs you can see (I can too) now, the retro/futuristic vibe I was going for was more a stylistic choice. It doesn't really have any bearing on the meaning. I think starlux sounds flowly and it also sounds techno. Perhaps I was trying have the logo match the way it sounds in my head.\n\nSomething to think about...\n\n"

The kind that satisfies.\n\nThis may not be what you are going for - but it's what I have been associating in my mind.\n\nI like your direction so far because it promises fun & suprises.
