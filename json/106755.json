If you want to make it look genuinely beautiful and pleasurable to read, but still in keeping with the genre, which typeface do you first reach for?\n\n",

Actually an insult to comic sans; IIRC, some comic books were better written. Well, that's the best-seller market for you...\n\n"

A little more personality than the usual text faces, but it seemed to be the right kind of personality for a dark mystical race-against-death adventure. I had thought I was looking for something a bit constructed and artificial, and was actually surprised that something so calligraphic seemed the best fit.\n\n"

As bland as possible, without being Times New Roman. There’s no saving blandity, you might as well embrace it.\n\nIf you’re setting the special signed leatherbound edition, use Bembo. It feels old and classy yet very familiar, which is exactly what people want for a classed up version of literary drivel.\n\n"
