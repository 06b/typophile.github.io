I'm trying to identify the typeface used for \"PRAIRIE CITY OIL CO.\" It looks similar to Copperplate in many ways but a bit more condensed with some curled 'C's. Anyone might know where I can find a digital version of this font or trace down a better specimen that'd be great.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [prairiecityoilco-type.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828175026/http:/typophile.com/files/prairiecityoilco-type.jpg) | 89.89 KB |\n| [DSCN22801.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828175026/http:/typophile.com/files/DSCN22801.jpg) | 207.41 KB |\n\n",

The \"Detroit\" angled serifs are used in fonts like Brothers [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers-ot/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828175026/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers-ot/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers-ot/\") but here the letter-forms are rounded instead of angled.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "MANUFACTURED ONLY BY THE PRAIRIE CITY OIL CO: I agree with Ryuk that Billhead 1900 is a good starting point for duplicating most of the letters, modified by adapting the top half of Billhead 1890 for the \\_C\\_. You have to do a fair amount of clipping of some but not all mini-serifs, flatten the dished ends of the strokes, and do various adjustments to get it right. I would use the lowercase version of the letters:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828175026im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Billhead1900PrairieCityOilTypophile116061_3873.jpg)\n  \nThe source of the curls on Billhead 1890 is unknown, but I suggest that it might be Art Gothic [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/art-gothic-hih/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828175026/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/art-gothic-hih/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/art-gothic-hih/\")  \nDon \n"
