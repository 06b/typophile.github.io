  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nI have a major problem: my font is completely ready, I double checked everything, opentype features, opentype classes, kerning classes and so on. When I generate the font, fontlab does not complain about anything (just slowing around 92%). And then when I try to install it through Font Book, Font Book refuses to install it and warn me that the file is not good and can corrupt the system. Yet when I put the font in the \"Fonts\" file of InDesign, it works perfectly. What could the problem be? As I have no tip from Fontlab about any problem, I am a bit lost...\n\n",

You give us absolutely no hint as to where the problem may be: Operating system, InDesign version, error messages, or even what exactly you \"double checked\". Everything is left to our mighty crystal balls.\n\nJust a wild guess from a Windows guy: is there an open glyph in your font? (No idea as to how forgiving font book/InDesign is in that respect.\n\nAndreas\n\nPS: Found something in the [article of the Unspeakable on Font Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424142137/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_Book). Read the \"criticism\" section. Maybe an OS upgrade will help.\n\n"

Now things have changed :) When I try to install the font with Font Book, it does not bug, but nothing happens, the font does not appear, and when I try a second time to install it, the font appear with a little dot which means it has been installed twice... Still it remains akward.\n\n"
