      "content": "I think that if you’re going for “clean,” this doesn’t quite work as a logo. The tightness of the letterspacing causes a number of extremely dark, frankly ugly spots; for example, the m and i and the a and t. Also, using what appears to be Helvetica isn’t often a spectacular way to distinguish yourself in a logo, nor is it especially considered modern anymore (although it can certainly be if used in the right way).\n\nI’d try working on your logo concept some more; maybe just do some free associative sketches for a while. What would you like to convey to someone with your logo? How do you see yourself as a photographer? I’d experiment with both typographic and largely graphic logos; either can work as long as it’s inventive and memorable.\n\n"

Or that 14 tightly-spaced characters in Arial Black does not a logo make.\n\nMatt, by the same token – you’re not selling design, so if you like what you’ve done, go with it. Otherwise, maybe consider hiring a designer who actually specialises in these things; maybe you could trade them some photographic services in payment.\n\n"
