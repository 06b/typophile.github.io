Everywhere I've looked that has this typeface doesn't include the vertical stemmed V and W and a few other complex letter forms that I'm looking for. If anyone knows where I can find the version of Avant Gard Gothic included in this linked pic and could let me know it would be great.\n\n[http://bowfinprintworks.com/Fonts/FontScans/AvantGardeGothBd.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20141111031116/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Fonts/FontScans/AvantGardeGothBd.gif \"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Fonts/FontScans/AvantGardeGothBd.gif\")\n\n",
