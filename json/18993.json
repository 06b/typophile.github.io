But I wonder how this will play out amongst your average designer and international audiences?\n\n",

Better still a tour of duty (or two) in Basingstoke.\n\n\\>What if we are invaded by giant alien reptiles from space and soemoen has to to kick they’re but??!!\n\nWell, the design community may be able to come together with a series of posters promoting alien awareness or perhaps a signage system directing the aliens to “our leaders”. Better still a coffee table book with some tastefully moody black and white alien pictures and series of essays from film makers and product designers. Well there goes next years April Fools…\n\n"
