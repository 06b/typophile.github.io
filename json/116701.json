  "content": "Hi!\n\nI have a question regarding the Font Family Futura - in particular the font Futura XBlkCn BT.\n\nTo be more precise I want to know if this font is allowed to use in Logos etc.?\n\nI am literally searching the hell out of google to find a proper answer for this, unfortunately not with a satisfying answer. What I found out until now is that the font family from futura is not per definition protected for any use in a logo or a corporate identity. According to my research futura itself is \"public domain\", which means (at least in my understanding) that this font should be free for corporate use or did I understood that wrong?\n\nActually I am a bit concerned since a friend of mine informed me that the brand \"Absolut - Vodka\" is using a similar font for their corp-identity.....\n\nSince I am not that deep familiar with the copyright in terms of fonts I would really appreciate any feedback, links for copyright terms for fonts, etc from you guys. :-)\n\nThanks in advance for your answers.\n\nCheers!\n\n",
