In it, Hoefler mentions a typeface Barry Deck created for Nickelodeon called “Fontoid.”\n\nTry as I might, I haven’t been able to find a sample of this anywhere, and I’d very much like to compare it with the other faces I’m looking at.\n\nDoes anyone have a sample or know where I can find one?\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ what is the stereotypical behavior and appearance of a designer?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011041318/http:/typophile.com/node/14186 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Festive, \"Party\" type suggestions? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011041318/http:/typophile.com/node/41702 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
