  "content": "I'm wondering if anyone know the intended use of U+0315, called COMBINING COMMA ABOVE RIGHT. Is this glyph intended to be used to represent ejectives/implosives in languages which use an apostrophe to indicate glottalization, or is it intended to represent the alternate form of the haček found in pairs like Ď ~ ď? While the former will always resemble the apostrophe, the latter can differ significantly depending on typeface, so I'm wondering which form should ideally be used.\n\nAndré\n\n",

      "content": "When an apostrophe is used to indicate a glottal stop, that is regarded as a separate letter and thus not an accent mark. However, a transformation of a consonant could be indicated by an accent, such as palatalization, so if there is such a thing as glottalization...\n\nAh, yes, Wikipedia tells me that glotallic consonants are represented with an apostrophe in the IPA.\n\nU+0315 was added to Unicode in version 1.1, and is a combining diacritical mark. But I can't find the original proposal for adding it to Unicode.\n\n"

U+0315 is provided for compatibility with visual encodings that handled e.g. ď with a separate character from the normal haček. It's mostly useful these days as a component glyph for use in making diacritic composites for Czech and Slovak glyph sets. Note that although nominally a combining mark it actually requires an advance width, so is not usually handled with GPOS dynamic mark positioning.\n\n"

      "content": "The glottal stop, when so signaled using one fairly common orthography, uses the \"raised comma,\" U+02BC. But remember, that's just one orthography. In Polynesian, the glottal stop is signaled with the turned comma, U+02BB, as in Hawai‘i. And in some languages, the glottal stop itself is used.\n\n"
