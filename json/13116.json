  "content": "Basically, why does what is illustrated in the attachment happen sometimes? Making a new weight should be simplified by something that will expand an outline by a set number of units, not complicated. There’s still so much to do to create a true bold, cleaning up unasked for points is a time waster. I figure I’m doing something wrong or else it wouldn’t need to generate these points (and sometime seperate contours). See attached gif to make sense of this.  \nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [why.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060524170707/http:/typophile.com/files/why.gif) | 21.67 KB |\n\n",

I had assumed it was probably just the kind of thing you should expect from an automatic process like this.\n\nYou may still want to split that point, though. Notice that the lower handle is below the other handle on the right (and probably the point to which it belongs). Adding a point somewhere in the middle should prevent this and allow you to retain basically the same curve. I don’t have any idea if that will have any effect on the autobold, though.\n\n"

I don’t see anything wrong with using it as long as the design works in the end. It may take some tweaking to achieve what you want, though.\n\nI remember reading a site with some suggestions on how to create bolds, but I can’t seem to find the address now.\n\n"
