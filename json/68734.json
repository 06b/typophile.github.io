This also implies a bit more space between A and D.  \nThat should do the trick.\n\n(Kerning is balancing the area's between the glyphs. Consider the white space between M and I & between A and D — these should be identical. That's two pairs fixed. Now try the same with the other pairs & you'll come to the same conclusion as I have.)\n\n"

A round to a vertical letter would have 3/4 of the unit and round to round would be 1/2 of the unit. Just determine how wide 1 unit is.\n\n"
