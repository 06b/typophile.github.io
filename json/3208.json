Lovecraft Historical Society (NPLHS) are constructing a \"complete 17th-century version of the fabled [_Necronomicon_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223916/http:/www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/contest.html)! Using a comprehensive set of custom-designed vintage fonts, artwork and text.\"   \n   \nWhile the contest is related to writing passages, it'd be interesting to see (from a typographer's standpoint) whether their version would stand up to the rigorous scrutiny of the Typophiles.   \n   \nTheir goal is to make it a downloadable PDF that could be printed and bound (so I guess it'll be only so realistic). But they have some example [woodcuts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223916/http:/www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/woodcuts.html), [decorative intitial caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223916/http:/www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/deccaps.html), [page decorations](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223916/http:/www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/pagedecs.html) and some example [PDF pages](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223916/http:/www.cthulhulives.org/necronomicontest/NconSamples.pdf). They seem to be mining the real thing for their facsimile, but I'm sure they're slipping up a few times. The PDF is a good way to scrutinize.   \n   \nIf you're not familiar, here's some [info on _The Necronomicon_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223916/http:/www.geocities.com/SoHo/9879/nechist.htm) from the man himself, H.P.\n\n",

He's really into this stuff, so I would think it would at least _appear_ to be authentic, even if it's completely concocted.   \n   \nI heard from him after writing my article about the use of type in movies ( [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223916/http:/www.ms-studio.com/typecasting.html)). He seems to be one of the few people working in Hollywood who cares about type. He recently started selling some of [his fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223916/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/ephemera/) on MyFonts, too.\n\n"

Luckily for me, I don't read Latin at all.   \n   \nAs for the HPLHS and fonts, I've evaluated some of their freeware stuff, and it was pretty abysmal. Bad enough that I decided not to give them feedback because I didn't know where to start. They needed basic ideas like sidebearings sorted out. You can see this in the sample above. Compare the b-long-s pair with the \"is\" or \"os\" pairs.   \n   \nThat aside, these folks are great, and some of their other stuff is truly wonderful. I have bought quite a few copies of the \"Shoggoth on the Roof\" CD (though beware of imperfect reproductions). They also have tons of cool resources for live-action Call of Cthulhu role-playing.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"
