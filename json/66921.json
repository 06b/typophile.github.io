I still have the original .ai\n\nWhen I inherited this work-station, there were over four thousand fonts activated- over the last year, I've been trying to get rid of as many as I can. (the previous user installed most of dafont's inventory, and years of other free fonts, on top of an ancient copy of Adobe font folio and a bitstream collection). Somewhere I have a backup of all of these fonts, but I've already gone through about two thouand of them, without any luck.\n\n"
