It should be be a font that is still very readable even if the lines get sloppy in case the grass grows unevenly or the fertilizer isn’t applied perfectly. Also, I imagine that it’ll be easier to make straight lines than curves.\n\n [‹ Hitchcock font by Matt Terich](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202182126/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31052 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [wordmark for visual artist ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202182126/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36338 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
