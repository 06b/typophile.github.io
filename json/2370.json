  "content": "I'm selling my Font Book from Digital Typeface Compendium. It includes the Font Finder brochure as well. I wanted to offer it for sale here first before uploading it to eBay. If it sells here, I'll donate half the proceeds to Typophile. This is a serious offer. For more information, here's a link to the book on Amazon: [The Font Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111025837/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/3930023024/103-3926384-5127865?v=glance&vi=reviews)   \n   \nIf you're interested, I prefer PayPal as a payment method. Email me for further details: [dylan@customartco.com](mailto:dylan@customartco.com)\n\n",
