As our FAQ says, these kinds of fonts are very easy and cheap to make, so it could be custom, but there are many _similar_ fonts available. Here is a list of some I saw on my browse: Andy (p.3), FF Friday (p.4), Skippy Sharpie (p.5), Greg HW (p.6), Dik HW (p. 10) and Casino Hand (p.24). My criteria were to have the same 'a' style and 'G', with a neat, skilled lettering style.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
