  "content": "Some time ago I discovered a feature in InDesign that would take straight text fractions like this: 1/2 and turn them into beautful \"nut\" or split-level fractions. You know: superscripted denoninator, properly kerned solidus, and properly sized numerator. It was as easy as using oldstyle figures is now in open type fonts.\n\nCan anyone remind me how to work this magic spell? I remember typing in a typewrite-style fraction, selecting just the fraction, then executing a command somehow from a menu or something. And I'm not talking about using fractions from the glyphs palette. This method works for odd fractions like 7/32.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n",
