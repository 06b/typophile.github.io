  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI really need to invest in a color printer for proof work in my graphic design/illustration/type/logo design workflow. I'd like to be able to print out a half accurate proof for any client work to give to them.\n\nAbout 5 years ago I had a $1000 Epson A3 Photo injet printer (can't remember the series number) but it was a real hassel to get it to print correctly and the ink very quickly dried and my overal experience was very frustrating and disappointing and stopped using the thing as a result.\n\nSo I was looking at an A4 color laser. I have a black toner Hp1200 laserjet for about 9 years and it has just been terrific. Just wondering if anyone can recommend me a good A4 color laser for my situation and any specifics I should be looking out for.\n\nNot sure if I could trust Epson again after that experience although I'm sure their other products are much better.\n\nAny help would be great\n\n",

HP seems to print too thin, at least the monochrome printers.\n\nYou also should care about duplex precision and the document authenticity of the toner. For example it can happen, that the toner gets off, if you fold the paper, although it is resistant against finger nails and wetness.\n\nI have heard, that the toner, that Lexmark uses, is document authentic. Samsung is not. But Lexmark tends to print thicker than Samsung, at least, if you compare the monochrome printers.\n\nUnfortunately they never tested a Xante printer.\n\nI would like to know more of those sources.\n\n"

      "content": "I bought a Xerox Phaser 6130 a year ago and the quality is very good. As I recall, it worked 'out of the box'. The setup switch, which I found to be fiddly, is similar to the multi-position switches on mobile phones and cameras, so if you're familiar with those, you'll have no problem. I've not had to replace one of the 4 cartridges, but I'm a light (home) user.\n\nAs to whether it's the 'best' or not, I can't say, but it does reproduce text, drawn vector shapes and solid fills extremely well and photographs look pretty good. The problem is that one person's 'excellent', is another person's 'average'. I've used standard laser/copier paper and photographic. The output is very good on both, but it's noticeably better on the photographic paper. I've had a couple of inkjets and in every respect the Xerox is much better. It was reasonably priced, too.\n\n"

The manual lists various papers including Thick Card stock up to 220gsm, but it wouldn’t accept 180gsm Photo Gloss Inkjet paper. The printer is very particular about paper types; you have to specify the correct paper type in the printer’s menu. I’ll investigate.\n\n"
