Some typographers and calligraphers asserted they followed the path of Morris. Among them, find at least three names of early XX th century typographers: the American Frederic Goudy, the Austrian Victor Hammer and the German Rudolf Koch.\n\nDo you know other typographers under the influence of William Morris, by the way?  \nThanks in advance.\n\n",

Peterson is very good, and includes a chapter on the immediate, direct influences of Morris.\n\nI think the impact of Morris is huge, but more general. For one thing, he made revivals of old type fashionable, resulting in a flood of revivals in the early 20th century. Second, the idea of a 'designer' separate from a printer was apparently created by his example, though I'm sure others know more about this history. Third, and more minor, the revival specifically of the types of Griffo and Jenson was led by him, so all later revivals of these are influenced by his efforts, even when they reject his heavy style.\n\nAnother specific influence was his criticism of 'modern' types (Bodoni) and praise of 'old style', which led to specifically the revival of old style types.\n\nThere may well be stories about the influence of his style of illustration, and of his example of 'art book', but I don't know the stories.\n\n"

It was designed by D.B. Updike.\n\n_The Altar Book_, Bertram Goodhue, type designer and decorator, printed by Updike, 1896, is pure Kelmscott.\n\nBut do you really mean typographer, or type designer?\n\nThe most direct inﬂuence Morris had in type design was published by ATF in 1893 and named “Jenson Old Style”, a plagiarization of the Golden Type. Here it is from an Ivory Snow ad in _Ladies Home Journal_, Christmas 1903 (left hand page).

      "content": "Craig, what I said is accurate. Caslon was first revived at the time you say, but it was only used for reprinting of old books, or books with stories set in old times. It was generally used only to create deliberate antique effect.\n\nThe early Chiswick press books reviving Caslon did attract attention, I think, for their readability, as well as beauty. The next step was the creation of 'Old Style,' which was very widely used. But it has generally 'modern' features, but reduced contrast, which looked 'old style' enough to Victorian eyes. It was only after printer Emery Walker, a friend of Morris's, gave a talk about the history of type, showing samples of old printing, that Morris became passionate about type revival and designing and printing his own books.\n\nI did an article, 'Readability and Revival: The Case of Caslon,' for _Printing History_ New Series no. 10 (July 2011), where you can read more of the story. William Peterson, who was editor then, and truly knowledgable of that period and its personalities, lives here in Washington DC, and was kind enough to share with me his research that is relevant to the story. So I think I got it right.\n\nMorris was so much a taste and opinion leader that he changed the view of old styles, making them fashionable instead of quaint, and only after Morris did they start to be widely used. Morris wrote of \"the sweltering hideousness of the Bodoni letter, the most illegible type that was ever cut, with its preposterous thicks and thins ...\" I don't agree with Morris—though his passion is wonderful—but it seems that at the time if William Morris said something wasn't cool, it wasn't cool.\n\nIn America, for example, Vogue Magazine, started in 1892, adopted Caslon, and that started the Caslon popularity in the U.S. Emery Walker himself, if I remember rightly, preferred Caslon to Jenson.\n\n"

      "content": "I don’t think the dots connect quite so neatly, Bill.\n\nIt’s a bit of a stretch to call the Golden Type an old style, it’s more of a caricature, not a general purpose “readable old style” design.\n\nMorris Benton at ATF produced several antiquarian styles, e.g. Roycroft and Bodoni, and the Arts and Crafts Cheltenham, and the functionalist Clearface, before he got around to reviving an old style (Cloister, his Jenson).\n\nYou won’t ﬁnd true old style typefaces, other than sporadic Caslon, Golden Type knock-offs, and Della Robbia, widely used in the U.S. mass media until Goudy’s Kennerley in 1911 (not a revival), which was the game changer. In the UK, Imprint (1913) appears to have been the ﬁrst new old style.\n\nAs you say, people were quite happy with “Old Style”. Morris Benton thought the readability road ahead was through Cheltenham, Century and Clearface, not old style.\n\nSo, while William Morris, D.B. Updike, Will Bradley, Walter Crane (_Of the Decorative Illustration of Books_) et al can be said to have stimulated the fashion for historicist graphic design and page layout in the late 1890s, it didn’t translate into the production of popular “readable old style” text faces during the ﬁrst decade of the 20th century. If William Morris, who died in 1896, was so inﬂuential typographically, why the delay?\n\n"

      "content": "Since Caslon was revived before Morris, while it's clear that Morris' own types were copied, that does indeed complicate the question of how much influence Morris had on the revivals of Baskerville and Garamond, and on the creation of such faces as Plantin or Poliphilus or Bembo.\n\nMorris' revivals of Jenson were outliers, after all.\n\nBut many of the earliest revivals - Cloister Old Style, Centaur - not only were Jenson revivals too, but they were clearly influenced by Morris' Golden Type. Not in the sense of their content, as with Jenson Oldstyle, but in the sense that he called further attention to the merits of the first Roman type.\n\nI did notice, though, a mention that the success of ATF's revival of Bodoni was one of the forces leading to Cloister Old Style. So there was an independent impetus to revival as well. Since the \"butterfly effect\" tells us history would turn out differently if even minor, seemingly irrelevant, things are changed, it's difficult to make the case that there was enough other impetus towards revival that without Morris it would still have happened the way it did.\n\nSo it could well be that if it weren't for William Morris, the Caslon revival and the Phemister old style would not have led to a Baskerville revival and then a Plantin revival... and so there would never have been a Times New Roman. (Despite it having been \"bigoted and narrow, mean and Puritan\" and thus not the sort of thing of which Morris would have approved, I suppose.)\n\n"

As I said, Caslon was used by Vogue in 1992, and—here I am relying on Mac MacGrew's book American Metal Typefaces—this started the popularity of Caslon in America. This would be the 'McKellar' Caslon, a foundry type allegedly produced by electroplating originals. In England, George Bernard Shaw, who knew both Morris and Walker through Socialist circles, insisted on printing his plays in Caslon, before the turn of the century. You can see some of the story [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/books.google.com/books?id=ti3EGtFcq5IC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=Shaw+on+Caslon&source=bl&ots=-B84it16Uv&sig=rquR7aEA4CdpTe3n4AV9NMzwRig&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZXcLU8iHF8nq0wHCvoDQBA&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Shaw%20on%20Caslon&f=false).\n\nThis \\*general use\\* of Caslon I think dates after Walker and Morris were praising it. The general revival of old style types involves both Caslon and the Jenson that Morris copied, as well as many other types.\n\nIn America, certainly Theodore Lowe DeVinne was also an influence, criticizing the high contrast types of his time, and using his influence to reduce thick-thin contrast in the original Century type, commissioned for the magazine he printed. He gave a good review of Caslon in his Historical Printing Types, but I don't think he used Caslon himself, whereas a book by Morris was printed in Caslon in 1892, probably under the influence of Walker.\n\nIt is a general revaluation of older types that I think is the main influence of Morris, though the case is circumstantial; I can't prove that Morris was a key factor in changing typographic tastes, but when you look at the big picture, it sure looks that way. Of course it is ATF, Linotype, Monotype who use the pantographic punch cutter to do the revivals over next forty years.\n\n"

Goudy bought Morris's physical Kelmscott Press, and the first thing Goudy published on his own Village Press was an essay by Morris and Walker.\n\nThis story of going through a Morris phase, then rejecting it, but doing more sober historically influenced work, including revivals, happens again and again. Updike initially went through a phase of imitating Morris, producing the best book done in the US with a Morris aesthetic, according to Peterson. Then he rejected the Morris aesthetic, but did historical style printing, as the [wikipedia article on him explains.](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Berkeley_Updike#The_Merrymount_Press) And of course wrote his great history of types—but it started with Morris. Bruce Rogers got into book design because of seeing Morris's work. And of course Centaur is a Jenson-influenced type, though Rogers also rejected the heavy Morris aesthetic in .\n\nAlso people were doing revivals before 1911, so it wasn't Kennerley that suddenly turned the tide. Inland Type Foundry did a Caslon in 1901, which became the basis for Monotype's Caslon 337. And Monotype did a Caslon as early as 1903. ATF's Caslon 540 was 1902, and their Caslon 471 was before that. Lawson's book also tells the same story about Vogue in America, but more extensively, with more details about the influence of Vogue's use. Also the Doves type (1900), used by Walker's press, was influential, as Peterson documents. Morris was just all over the place, though you could argue it was equally Walker. The revival snowball was already rolling when Goudy started doing type.\n\n"

That Goudy was influenced by Morris, though, while it shows that Morris must get some of the credit, doesn't itself show that Goudy didn't have an important role - although your other point, that Goudy wasn't the only typographer to be inspired by Morris, and then move on to more sober historical revivals _is_ telling.\n\nGiving Morris full credit seems odd, since his own revivals are so different from the other revivals that came after him. But seeing how Goudy, Rogers, and Updike reacted to their initial inspiration by Morris means that they get some of the credit too, because they produced revivals that would be more popular and that would stand the test of time. Without their contributions, Morris might have been seen as only an eccentric, rather than someone who was influential and even pivotal.\n\n"

(Other than the Old Style that originated c. 1850.)\n\nYes, after Morris old styles did start to be \\*widely\\* used, but only long after, and after the efforts of Goudy.\n\nI don’t deny that “the ball was rolling”, as you say, but outside of the general fashion.  \nBear in mind, the private presses were an incubator (which we can see with hindsight), a tiny market removed from the commercial mainstream.\n\nI asked: Why the delay?\n\nAnd I identiﬁed two reasons: ﬁrstly because the thinking, by those such as Morris Benton, about readability/legibility was towards ideas such as heavier weight and lower contrast (Century and Cheltenham) and clarity of form (Century and Clearface). I suspect that historicism was primarily an issue of authenticity for Benton, not a key to readability.\n\nAnd secondly, it took Goudy a while to ﬁgure out what made the historical old style tick, how to make it work again, and for it to become popular through the “killer app” of Kennerley.\n\nIsn’t it counter intuitive that a style hundreds of years old would have been considered to be efficient in the Progressive era? It took Goudy’s experiments with historical pastiche and text color to synthesize, through design, an attractive demonstration of a proposition that William Morris’ elitist typography had only hinted at, that the allure of the past could be a gateway to contemporary mass functionality.\n\n"

The fact that it took time to build is not surprising. To see trends, you have to look over time. That something started small is not unusual. Also people like Lawson and Peterson looked at a lot of literature of the time. I don't think they deserve your disparaging remarks.\n\nJohn, I agree that the credit should be spread around. The earlier efforts of the Chiswick Press were also important, and all those people, including Goudy, were a part of what created the change. I'm not saying that Goudy didn't have an impact, Nick, but I think when you track it, Morris (or Walker-Morrison) is more of an inflection point. Of course the inflection point also coincided with the invention of the pantographic punch cutter, which enabled revivals to be made much more cheaply, I think. So that may have equally been a factor.\n\nBy the way, on readability, I think it was Theodore Lowe DeVinne's critique of high contrast which was the influence. Benton the father did the first version of Century, following DeVinne's guidance. Later with M.F. Benton's Clearface, an effort to be highly readable, I think the influence was some research of the time.\n\n"

A relatively small group of fans bought an album from 1967 (when the Velvet Underground was unusual), and precipitated a change that hit the mainstream ten or fifteen years later (when they were less so). This sort of thing isn't that strange, really: You have a small group of cognoscenti devotees of a particular style carrying on a line of thought different from the mainstream – and then at some point fashion changes and they're suddenly in the middle of it.\n\nSo in this case it's perfectly possible some later-influential designers had a cult-figure Morris devotion going on, which bloomed into fashion when other trends ended up in a similar area. It may even have been fashionable in a smaller context, like the art world (there's plenty of examples of Morris-style lettering there), without breaking throught into the mainstream. It's not like the styling of today's graphic design avant-garde, to compare, is the same as its mainstream equivalent, though both are \"in fashion\" in distinct senses.\n\n"

But I didn't feel that way until Nick Shinn's latest post just before yours. In 1900, a lot of typefaces were popular that hardly anyone would have considered in 1950 or today.\n\nThe revival phenomenon that needs to be explained is the series of revivals including those of Baskerville and Garamond, involving both ATF and (British) Monotype.\n\nThe candidate inspirations are:\n\nThe revival of Caslon, which is known to have led to Phemister old style.\n\nMorris' revival of Jenson's type as Golden.\n\nGoudy's creation of Kennerley.\n\nAnatomy of a Typeface notes that Bembo was the last of the initial group of Monotype revivals, and that it came out in 1929. It specifically takes the position that this was engendered by William Morris and the private press movement. As well, it is noted that Monotype created a version of Centaur... and Bruce Rogers does seem to have been inspired by Morris.\n\nIn my earlier post, I noted, in effect, that if none of those 30,000 people buying the Velvet Underground album had musical talent, then the Velvet Underground would not have been influential. Which is why I felt there was room for those who felt that the 'real' credit should go to Goudy or Rogers. And, of course, someone had to figure that it was worth reviving Garamond and Baskerville in addition to Jenson and Aldus: that decision changed revivals from being something for artistic books to something that impinged on general publishing.\n\n"

You know, there were such a thing as books, and a lot of people read them. It may well be that books led the way on the adoption of Caslon, though Vogue (1892) was, I believe a hugely popular magazine—and of course still around.\n\nAnd the adoption of Caslon, and then other revival old styles, for general use, not just antiquarian effect, was, as I said, crucially influenced by Walker and Morris. And Caslon revivals were being churned out and sold by ATF and Monotype well before Kennerley in 1911. For example, [Frederic Warde, writing in 1925 about Bruce Rogers](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Farchive.org/stream/brucerogersdesig00ward%2523page/n9/mode/2up) relates that seeing Morris \"came as a revelation\" to Rogers and changed his whole way of thinking about books. Rogers is known for using Caslon a lot, starting in 1897 (see the bibliography in the linked book), and had a special version of Caslon cast for his use on the Monotype machine, Riverside Caslon, in 1909. Daniel Berkeley Updike [purchased Caslon in 1904](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Berkeley_Updike). Updike was probably the biggest Caslon fan ever, and printed 14,000 items over his career, many of them using Caslon. His Marymount press, even though it specialized in fine editions, was commercial and also did a lot of other work. The point is, judging by the most revered and influential book designers, the Caslon freight train was going full speed before Goudy ever did Kennerley, and the popularity of Caslon with these taste leaders was itself an invitation to revive other old styles, quite apart from Goudy's work. And these guys who actually did the revivals sure knew about Rogers and Updike. Oh, and I believe, Stanley Morrison, who did the later revivals with Monotype England, despised Goudy and his work. (I like some of Goudy.)\n\nSo your idea about Kennerley leading the way for old style revivals isn't consistent with the facts of book history. And by the 20s, I know I can find many, many ads in Caslon. Not least in The New Yorker, which started in 1926, if I remember rightly. And it used in its text Linotype Caslon Old Face—not Kennerley. And it still uses versions of Caslon, including, er, mine. So John's story of the Velvet Underground is very much on point, with Morris as the Velvet Underground, Rogers and Updike as in the first wave of those influenced, and popular taste in advertising following. And Caslon had it own momentum, apart from Goudy.\n\n"

So the Life Magazine is probably in one of those. As to what is \"fashionable,\" Nick, I haven't done a study of the advertising of that day, but if Vogue used a Caslon in 1892 and Life magazine was using it in 1906, I would say that is probably evidence of its further use in text of magazines. By 'fashionable' I meant, as I indicated above, that it was regarded as 'cool' by taste leaders of the time, such as the owners of Vogue, who wanted to use a real old style (not Phemister's Old Style, which DeVinne had slammed in Historical Printing Types). As to its use in advertising, which I grant you is also a kind of 'fashionable' I don't know.\n\nYou're right that I haven't studied magazines of the period, but your story, above is very off target. You wrote:\n\n\"You won’t ﬁnd true old style typefaces, other than sporadic Caslon, Golden Type knock-offs, and Della Robbia, widely used in the U.S. mass media until Goudy’s Kennerley in 1911 (not a revival), which was the game changer. In the UK, Imprint (1913) appears to have been the ﬁrst new old style.\"\n\nCaslon was not \"sporadic\". On the contrary there was a race to have it, with all the leading foundries—ATF, Linotype, Monotype, Intertype—having to have it, and actually even multiple versions, before Kennerley was drawn. And we know of at least two popular magazines that were using it. And by the effort the foundries put into it, I would still bet that there was much wider use as well in books and the text of magazines. In any case, Kennerley was not a \"game changer\". Indeed, as you said, Goudy was trying to do an old style to improve on Caslon, which was already by 1911 seen as one of the best models. The game changers were Walker and Morris.\n\nHere is the testimony in 1920 (from my article, and thanks to Peterson's prior research) of Charles T. Jacobi, who was for long editor of the Chiswick Press, which had first revived and used Caslon extensively, though for an antique look: \"the excellent design of these different founts was not generally appreciated until about the year 1888, when the Arts and Crafts Society first came into existence, and Mr. Emery Walker was perhaps more responsible than anyone else for making known this series of faces.\" Walker was the innovator in seeing old styles as suitable for contemporary use, but the famous Morris, who took up the lance, was the force that spread the idea.\n\n"

I don't understand what you mean by 'real'.\n\nAnd as to 'sporadic,' I didn't just refer to Life. I mentioned Vogue, which both Lawson and MacGrew say led to popularity of Caslon in the US. And I mentioned both Bruce Rogers and D.B. Updike, who are said to have designed a lot of books in Caslon. But above all, I just can't believe all four major foundries were idiots spending huge time doing versions of Caslon for no demand. And Linotype spent four years 1919-23 doing specific drawings of every character in every size of Caslon. That is after Goudy's Kennerley, but I never heard that Chauncy Griffith at Linotype had any particular love for Goudy, and I don't even think they published a single Goudy design, though they did do revivals.\n\nBy the way, who else besides Nick thinks that Kennerley drove the train? My view, that Walker and Morris led the change in taste, that Jenson revivals and Caslon came next, and the rest later climbing on the bandwagon is I think consistent with the view of other historians, and the facts that I know. Did Goudy ever say that his Kennerley influenced Linotype, Monotype, and ATF to do revivals? Is there any opinion from anybody of the time that says this? What's the evidence?\n\nBy the way, ATF, having done several Caslon revivals already, did a Bodoni revival—Benton worked on it—from 1910 to 1911, when Goudy was working on Kennerley. That is not an old style, but it is a revival. The point is that the whole revival movement comes arguably from Walker and Morris, and the invention of the Pantographic Punch Cutter by Benton the father. The idea that it comes from Goudy, who was one of the followers, and specifically from Kennerley, is to me a non-starter. The ball had been rolling for 20 years by then.\n\n"

(And if it was, since Caslon's revival preceded Morris' activity, this would also disprove the claim that Morris was pivotal.)\n\nThat is all I meant when I referred to the later revivals as \"real\"; I meant they were the ones of interest, as part of a broad movement to revive numerous typefaces; I was not trying to disparage Caslon's revival.\n\nExcluding Caslon, which came along too early to be to Morris' credit, and excluding Morris' own specific revival, the Golden Type, we have a bunch of revivals that did take place in a post-Goudy time frame. People who didn't like Goudy's types (I like some of them, the most popular ones, but I admit I'm not myself a fan of much of his output) could still have been influenced by him at second hand.\n\nSo, to me, the question is: was there really a big gap when while there were some oldstyle types - Caslon, Jenson Oldstyle, and Phemister's Old Style - nothing much else happened until ATF revived Garamond and Baskerville, which would support, from a timing viewpoint, Nick Shinn's argument?\n\nOr were there other revivals, or at least other indications of interest in earlier typefaces, in the time span following Morris' Golden Type, that show that it wasn't just a flash in the pan that would have led nowhere until an important later event - such as Kennerley by Goudy.

Nothing new in the way of old.\n\nBut most importantly for the old style revivals that would follow, Kennerley presented a newly (or rediscovered) stringent concept of fit.  \nAs Goudy described it, _“What was wrong with Caslon? I had by this time decided that the pages presented a spotty appearance, largely due to the strong contrast in color between the capitals and the lower-case, and partly due to the wide ﬁtting of the letters themselves, making it impossible to present each word as a compact unit, which I felt was desirable, for only if each word is a compact unit can close spacing between words be used.”_\n\nGoudy would subsequently employ this concept of tight ﬁt in his Goudy Old Style, and in Italian Oldstyle, which took it to the max.\n\nYou can see it in the sequence “p\\_e\\_a” [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/f.cl.ly/items/1i1w3e2R0g172w023G36/Kennerley_CU.jpg). The pointedly diagonal stress which Goudy attributes to the old style enables these three letters to be butted up against one another, without creating a clot between “p” and “e”. That’s how Jenson did it. And it’s how Morris Benton did it in [Cloister](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/f.cl.ly/items/320Q240R3R442Y331p3j/Meal.png), his Jenson.\n\nAs a new typeface which demonstrated a theoretical principle, I believe that Kennerley was instrumental in opening typographers’ eyes to the look and potential of the old style. There were other related memes and connections in play too in the ﬁrst few years of the century, such as the method of Edward Johnston with broad-pen lettering, inﬂuential on Eric Gill, who worked with St. John Hornby of the Ashendene Press, who also owned WH Smith & Sons, for whom Gill produced a corporate identity utilising a special “old style” [lettering style](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/f.cl.ly/items/231e1j1D263G3W2P3b2v/Gill_Lettering.jpg) he designed. Again, note the combination of diagonal stress and tight ﬁt.\n\nI rest my case…\n\n"

      "content": "John, I guess I haven't been sufficiently clear, so let me have a go at it again. Caslon got general notice after the revival by William Pickering, publisher, and Charles Whittington, printer at the Chiswick Press. The book that first got notice was Lady Willoughby's Diary, 1844. There were subsequent Chiswick Press editions using Caslon, but, and this is the important point, they were always of old books or books set in old times. They were used for antique effect. So far as know, nobody put them to general use for books, magazines, or for that matter advertising, before Walker brought them to attention of Morris, and through both their efforts to the rest of the English speaking world.\n\nFor Lady Willoughby's Diary, it was not strictly speaking a revival; it was actually actually old fonts of foundry type stored at the Caslon Foundry, pulled out after long neglect. The first time you have actual recutting of old types—always with some changes—is with Morris. And \\*immediately\\* (in 1893) you get ATF doing a Jenson/Morris knock-off. And as early at 1897 you get a Caslon recutting, and then a whole bunch of new versions of Caslon beginning in the new century. And they are being used in popular magazines, Vogue in 1892, and Life, as we have seen from at least 1906. Further, both Bruce Rogers and Daniel Berkeley Updike are using revival versions, including Rogers' custom version for the Riverside Press. And you have good Jensons with the Doves type (1901, I think) by Cobden-Anderson, who had worked with Morris, and Centaur (1913) from Rogers, who was originally inspired by Morris. The actual recutting of old types with revisions, including at ATF only begins with Morris. That's why I say that he was the 'inflection point'.\n\nAnd Goudy is aware of all this, and specifically is trying to 'fix' Caslon in his Kennerley, as he says in Nick's quote.\n\nNow you have both a bunch of Caslons and Jensons by 1911, and the revival of Bodoni by ATF in 1910-11 by Benton. Then in 1913 you have Plantin, done at Monotype England. [Here Frank Hinman Pierpont says](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin_(typeface)) the 1913 revival is because he saw the fonts displayed at the Plantin Moretus Museum. And you have Centaur also in 1913. Now you've already had real revivals rolling for twenty years. So what is the evidence that Pierpont and Rogers were influenced by Goudy's success? I suspect the answer is none. That's why the story of Goudy influencing Monotype England to do revivals is unconvincing to me. Also when you get Morrison on board, he and Goudy apparently did the Garamond revivals at the same time, and he disparaged both Garamont and Goudy. So was he influenced by Goudy? Not likely.\n\n"

That is an interesting approach, and I look forward to reading his article.

I wasn't conflating different senses of 'fashionable' as not looking at advertising at all. So I am happy for Nick's notice of this work, and look forward to reading his article. But it doesn't change the type revival story in the late 19th and first half of the 20th century. Putting Goudy at the center, rather than Morris, I just don't think is supported by the evidence.\n\nAs to fixing Caslon, absolutely everybody does it who has revived Caslon, including me. Generally people do reduce the weight of the caps, and do tighter spacing. I also reduced the weight of the caps (so did Carol Twombly for Adobe, but made them very tall), but for the text size I kept the looser spacing, as for me that was 'a feature, not a bug.' But as I have written, Caslon is a kind of Rorschach test for every revival of it: we see different 'good' Caslons and 'mistakes' in it. The same kind of thing happens with every revival, though probably more with pre-Baskerville types than after.\n\n"

He got into printing late in his career.  \nThe idea that historic style was only used for historic documents is at odds with 19th century currents of design.  \nIn the ﬁeld of children’s literature, for example, designer-illustrators such as Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott were producing nostalgic graphic picture books before Kelmscott, some of them set in Caslon. The text and subject matter of these children’s books was from earlier times, but their conception was contemporary, they were considered archetypal and ideal—following a sentiment of anti-industrialization—as the idea of progressive modernism had yet to emerge.  \nAnd Walter Crane, for Edmund Evans, before his association with William Morris.  \n [This](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712114037/http:/www.randolphcaldecott.org.uk/imgbackc/MlkmdBackCvrRtldg1st.jpg) from 1882.\n\nAnother parallel thread, in America, was that of Colonial revivalism.

If economic conditions made room for more attractive types, and printers who filled that demand wanted their types which used more ink and paper to be _visibly_ different, so they would get the credit for what they were doing that added to the cost of their product -\n\nthat is, when you make something more expensive, you want customers to be able to see at a glance that they're getting better quality for their money -\n\nthen instead of using a more generously proportioned Scotch Roman, they will seize on any model they have to hand for a text type that people will accept even though it's distinguishable at a glance from what they're used to.\n\nEven if it's a Jenson previously used by the most elite and eccentric of private presses! Or, in the opposite direction, a pseudo-oldstyle that sticks a few of the features of Caslon on a Scotch Roman body - to take a more jaundiced view of the Phemister oldstyle than I normally feel justfied in taking.\n\nKennerley is more of a Jenson than the Golden Type and its Jenson Oldstyle imitator were. So it contributed to the later Cloister Oldstyle to some extent, I'm sure. It was used in books, and to our eyes today, it looks like something worth using in a book - unlike Jenson Oldstyle and Phemister Old Style, for different reasons. But while it was **the first modern revival** , since Jenson Oldstyle already made Jenson visible, ATF could well have made something very like Cloister anyways; they knew what Jenson really looked like, and given that the Ladies' Home Journal would even use Jenson Oldstyle, there was a demand out there for distinctive premium body copy faces, which typefounders could most easily fill with revivals.\n\nSo I feel I'm now in agreement with Nick Shinn on _two_ points:\n\nKennerly was the first really successful new old style.\n\nWilliam Morris' immediate direct influence on popular culture was limited. (As the Ladies' Home Journal shows, not nonexistent, but his influence at least took time to be felt.)\n\nCheltenham was a typeface widely used in advertising in the time period of interest. Cheltenham and Bookman (also by Phemister) are typefaces that have stayed around; Cheltenham was in the Kelsey catalog, and it was on phototypesetters. Bookman was on phototypesetters, and it was one of the earliest typefaces to be made available for laser printers, back when laser printer fonts were made of dots instead of outlines.\n\nWhile Kennerley dates from 1911 (from ATF? or did people buy fonts direct from Goudy?) it wasn't until 1920 that it was available _on Monotype composing machines_. That's when the popular taste got ahold of Kennerley, and sent a loud and clear signal that Kennerley was preferred to Cheltenham or Bookman as a text face replacement for Scotch Roman.\n\nOops. Benton revived Bodoni in 1909, and Garamond in 1917. So although I think the real pivotal influence is a change in economic conditions, this seems to point away from Goudy as being the inflection point.\n\nExcept, of course, that Bodoni and Garamond also took time to make the jump to the composing machine... so there could still have been earlier feedback from Kennerley from how popular it was with advertisers.\n\nOops. Kennerley was from 1911. 1909 is before 1911.\n\n"

Because this thread has focused heavily on Type Design, I was wondering if anyone had more to say on Typography and book design, and Morris' impact there. Put more specifically, what impact did Hubbard and the Roycroft press have, if any, on the dissemination of the Morris book design theories? If the question is why did it take so many years to get from Morris (1896) to a lot of historicist design in later years, wouldn't Hubbard (and Dard Hunter, et al at the Roycroft press) also be part of that story? [The question is humbly submitted]\n\n"
