  "content": "This is a familiar font, the closest thing I have is ‘royalacid’ based on the masthead font from Rollingstone magazine. Can someone help identify it for me? It reminds me of all the sweet TV shows I watched as a kid like “Hart to Hart”. Who can forget Mrs. H, she really was Gorgeous.\n\nFunnily enough there is another version of this album cover widely released which has really poor typography. Not sure why?\n\nCheers,\n\nDom\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Felt.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=Felt.jpg) | 48.82 KB |\n| [252430.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=252430.jpg) | 9.61 KB |\n\n",
