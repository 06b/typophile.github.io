  "content": "Hi.  \nNew to this forum and I'm hoping someone will be able to bestow their wisdom... failing that I'm trawling for hours for the answer on google and it'll make me cry with frustration!\n\nSo I'd like to create a series of posters. These posters use a font as it's focus – word play on a font for the purpose of creating an amusing poster. I aim to sell the posters. Can I do this? Clearly I'll need to license said font to use it on my mac, but then after that I'm unclear as to the ramifications.... i.e. commercial gain of using a font to my advantage.\n\nThe posters would only appeal to designs really, as designers more familiar with fonts/typefaces.\n\nHELP!!!!\n\nThank you :)\n\n",

      "content": "@&nbsp;Emma, each font has its own licence. So if you'd like to have advice you should tell us which font you’d want to use. Generally, if you buy a font from a professional vendor, you have the right to use it commercially. But be very careful by using fonts which you have downloaded »for free« somewhere. Some/many of these fonts are illegal knock-offs.\n\nUPDATE: Sorry, read your posting wrong. So don’t mind.\n\n"

I'd be using the name of the font/typeface in a phrase..and setting that phrase in the font/typeface I am referencing... so for example 'Frutiger Salad' then doing an illustration of a salad bowl using letters as fruit (all set in Frutiger)...\n\nMake sense...?!!

This covers what most users expect, the ability to use the font software to create documents of various kinds; correspondences, advertisements, publications, posters etc.\n\nThe term \"Commercial\" in an EULA generally means using the actual font software in a product that will be sold. Game, App, set-top box, etc. This usage is usually not allowed in a standard EULA and requires an additional license fee.\n\n"
