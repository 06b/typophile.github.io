I especially like to use it for on-screen  \nwork because it’s so shallow\\* without being devoid of  \ncharacter - in fact it’s one of the very few fonts that  \nI use both (very) small/lo-fi and very large. I think  \nPoppl really knew what he was doing, and we’re very  \nlucky to have such a design available.\n\n\\* [http://typophile.com/node/15367](http://web.archive.org/web/20060525045601/http:/typophile.com/node/15367)\n\n**The thing is, many people always complain about its  \nampersand. You can think “they need an education” but  \nthe fact remains it can be useful to have a “conventional”  \nampersand for it. So let’s make one.**\n\nBeing a Berthold font it’s become hard to view through  \nother font houses (can’t really blame them I guess)\\* like the  \nalways-great-for-a-preview Myfonts. You can see a cruddy  \nGIF\\*\\* on their site, but I would recommend downloading the  \nthe PDF that shows all their “Hybrid” fonts, from here:  \n [http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq\\_library/BQ\\_library.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20060525045601/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/BQ_library.html)\n\n\\* In fact I’d strongly recommend remaining squeaky-clean-legal  \n on this one. Maybe read the PDF usage conditions on their site,  \n and definitely only work with just renderings of the letterforms,  \n not original outlines.\n\n\\*\\* [http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq\\_library/90089.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20060525045601/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90089.html)\n\nhhp\n\n",
