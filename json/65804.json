I will be presenting a paper I wrote (co-authored by my supervisor, Professor Raymond Klein) titled **[In search of the font effect: the effect of conﬂict upon reading and naming typefaces serially](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820062821/http:/g10.cgpublisher.com/proposals/139)**. This will be my ﬁrst conference presentation.\n\nFor more information you may visit [the conference website](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820062821/http:/designprinciplesandpractices.com/Conference-2010/) where they have posted [a preliminary schedule](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820062821/http:/g10.cgpublisher.com/program-detail.html).\n\nThank you and happy new year.\n\n",

Lewis & Walker built upon the Stroop effect by showing that word recognition is improved when font characteristics like heaviness match words that carry the semantic characteristic of heaviness (rhinos are heavy, while rats are light).\n\nLewis & Walker: [http://www.psych.lancs.ac.uk/people/uploads/PeterWalker20061116T111653.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820062821/http:/www.psych.lancs.ac.uk/people/uploads/PeterWalker20061116T111653.pdf \"http://www.psych.lancs.ac.uk/people/uploads/PeterWalker20061116T111653.pdf\")\n\nCollaborators and I have built on Lewis & Walker’s research by showing that other kinds of characteristics built into fonts also can improve word recognition when paired with words that carry that semantic characteristic. For example a font can range on formality from formal to informal. People are faster to recognize formal words in a formal font and informal words in an informal font.\n\nI have tentatively proposed this as the key difference between serif and sans serif typefaces.\n\n"

If one's goal is not to improve recognition and readability, but to slant someone's perception of a text, one could choose a typeface that best suits the words you wish to emphasize.\n\nOh, dear.

The style of the font needs to match the style of the content for the best reading experience.\n\nThe finding also means that studies of legibility are not leading us towards one font to rule them all. Many fonts are necessary in order to match many kinds of content.\n\nJohn: _Can you tell whether that is due to positive reaction in the case of matched form and content or to negative reaction to mismatched form and content?_\n\nIn order to answer that question you would need words that are 1) consistent, 2) inconsistent, and 3) neutral with the font being presented. My study and Lewis & Walker only used consistent and inconsistent words. That would be an interesting next step.\n\n"

One conclusion was that time to name congruent stimuli was indeed faster than time to name incongruent stimuli. However the difference in time between neutral and congruent stimuli was less than the difference between neutral and incongruent stimuli. I do not have access to their data to attest to the statistical significance of their findings. Overall, an excellent read for anyone interested in anything Stroop.\n\n"

      "content": "Christopher, Macleod's congruency effect is certainly interesting, but I think we need to be careful in extrapolating from simple visual or property congruence (e.g. **heavy** vs. heavy; **rhinoceros** vs. **squirrel** ) and more abstract, culturally engendered associations such as formal/informal. I'd want to see evidence that the same kind of congruency effect accounts for the latter and not a higher level aversion to incongruent form and content.\n\nOne of the reasons that I found the study that MS sponsored on ‘personality’ in typefaces problematic is that most of the keywords used were ones that we've been trained to associate with certain styles of typography by their use in advertising. So typeface ‘personality’ seems to me a self-reinforcing construct: the more times people see Didot used in fashion magazines, the more likely they will be to associate Didot with ‘elegance’. And of course, if you are asking participants to select keywords from provided lists, rather than to explain the associations they make in their own words, one is filtering out a lot of potentially interesting variance. I'm the guy who'd be describing Didot as decadent :)\n\nI'm doubtful that congruence at this level of abstraction functions in quite the same way as simpler visual or property congruence. At the very least, the associations involved are more nuanced and variable.\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not sure that shows the dominance of reading.  \nCertainly, if the question is put **in text**\"what typeface is this?\" the answer, in words, may well be what the text signifies. However, flash the subject \"Helvetica\" set in Times, and then ask him to choose which typeface it was from a selection of various \"a\"s in different typefaces. I suspect he would choose Times, not Helvetica. \"Read and identify,\" not \"read and name.\"\n\nHas anyone re-done the Stroop test in a similar fashion?  \nThat would be, flash the word \"black\" in red, and then have the subject pick the colour from a palette of square swatches.\n\nBeyond a pointed rebus-concept headline, the idea that type may match the semantic meaning of text is banal.  \nSelf-referentiality, in which text refers to its own appearance, is a parlour trick, an art gallery amusement, a game of _double entendre_, nothing more. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n\nNonetheless, I do love the concrete poetry of type specimens.\n\n"
