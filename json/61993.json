  "content": "I'm going to be in Madrid around the last days of October until mid January & I was wondering if someone knows if there is a Type Design Workshop in the area. I have already googled for some, but everything I find is mostly design workshops where they introduce you to type use or masters in typography which are out of my budget.  \nI'm from Peru & no such workshops ever occur here, so I would like to gain some typographic design experience while I'm overseas, either by taking part in a workshop or by helping around as an intern in a foundry or with a typographer while I'm there.  \nI would appreciate any feedback on the subject.\n\n",
