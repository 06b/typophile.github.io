  "content": "Greetings!\n\nI have been working for the past few months in Illustrator on a display family with lots of alternate glyphs and ligatures and would like to begin the process of creating a fully functioning OT font in FontLab 5.0.2. (on Mac X)\n\nI have never used FontLab before and this business of a [UPM](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223110030/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/UPM) value of 1000 throws me already off. The number 1000 seems such a unyielding beast regarding it's compatibility with other numbers. It cannot be cleanly divided by 3 to start with. Could I use 1080, for instance? (With the exception of 7, it is divisible by any number between 1 and 10 and by 12, 15, 18, etc.)\n\nOr is s there a way to get around those rounding errors by choosing a number lower than 1000? In my case, the number 864 would allow all points in all weights to fall precisely on the grid. (the design has a few decorative elements, like seamless patterns for each weight, for instance, which I would like to remain seamless)\n\nAny input on this would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks,  \nPeter\n\n",

      "content": "Writing off the top of my head now:\n\nThe maximum UPM size permitted by the OpenType and TrueType specifications is 16,384 ( [http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/head.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223110030/http:/www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/head.htm \"http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/head.htm\")), and this is the value that FontLab Studio also permits as a maximum.\n\nYou need to keep in mind that the UPM size controls how glyphs will be sized at a specific point size (i.e. the point size chosen by the user in an application always corresponds to the UPM size of the font). If your UPM size is 2,000 and the user chooses 10 pt type, any glyph that will be 1,000 units high in your font will be exactly 5 pt high in print. Typically, in text fonts, the height of flat uppercase Latin letters such as E, H or I is 70% of the UPM size. So if you pick a non-1000 UPM size but you want for your font to go well with other fonts available on the user’s system (i.e. so that it’s not untypically small or untypically large in relation to other fonts), you should make your uppercase letters roughly 1,400 units high in a 2,000 UPM font. Of course this is just a rough estimation -- it can range from 1,100 to 1,600 units and will still be within the normal range. If your lowercase is quite large, you may want to make the uppercase appropriately smaller, somewhere around the 1,100 end. (For a 1,000 UPM font, all these values should be cut by half, obviously.)\n\nThe Type 1 specification states that absolute glyph coordinates must not exceed the range of –2,000 to +2,000, in both x and y directions ( [http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1\\_SPEC.PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223110030/http:/partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF \"http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1\\_SPEC.PDF\") section 3.3). This means that according to this specification, \\*regardless of the UPM size\\*, none of your extrema points should have the x or y position larger than ±2,000 units.\n\nWhile in the Type 1 specification states that the general limitation is ±2,000, the Type 1 spec supplement states that the most important implementations have higher limites: the Adobe PostScript RIP that is built into printers and imagesetters supports glyph coordinates up to ±4,095 and the Adobe screen font driver (ATM/CoolType) supports coordinates up to ±8,191. So these are the more important limitations to observe.\n\nAll those limitations are also valid for OpenType PS fonts as they are being converted to Type 1 fonts when sent to a PostScript printer.\n\nAdobe recently released a set of OpenType PS fonts with the UPM size of 2,048 (Adobe Arabic, Adobe Hebrew, Adobe Thai) in which there are a few very wide glyphs in which the x coordinate is about 3,500. This exceeds the original Type 1 limitation of ±2000 but is still within the Adobe PostScript RIP limitation of ±4095.\n\nIt seems that, regardless of the chosen UPM size, the maximum glyph coordinates in an OpenType PS (.otf) and Type 1 font is ±4095.\n\nIn FontLab Studio, you can check the maximum glyph coordinates in Font Info / Metrics and Dimensions / Key Dimensions / Font BBox. The values listed there are in order: (minimum x, minimum y) - (maximum x, maximum y). Make sure that the absolute value of neither of the numbers is larger than 4095.\n\nFontLab Studio currently has an internal implementation limit for glyph coordinates of –32,767 to +32,767. This means that very high coordinate values (e.g. over 10,000) might cause problems at geometric transformations (scaling, rotating etc.). You can observe the effect easily if you scale something in FontLab by 1000% several times -- you will see that the glyphs \"implode\".\n\nAltogether, it is not possible to give one definitive answer of what the maximum UPM size and maximum glyph coordinates should be. For reasons of conciseness (one of the glyph design principles recommended by the Type 1 specification), the designer should not choose a larger UPM size than is needed for the precision he’s looking for. If the precision offered by the UPM of 1000 is not sufficient, the designer should choose 2000, and failing that, higher values such as 3000 or 4000 — while on the other hand keeping in mind that all glyph coordinates should fit within the ±4095.\n\nDepending on the font format (OpenType PS or TT) the tool choice (Fontographer or FontLab Studio) and backwards-compatibility concerns (does the font really have to print on printers or imagesetters made in 1992?) the limits are different. Also, many of those limits are not \"hard\" or specified by any vendors, they’re empirical estimates that people found after struggling with some bugs in specific devices.\n\nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "Back in 1995; I wrote something about UPEM for Microsoft. This was in relation to the 'head' table in a TrueType font and why 2048 was chosen for TrueType by Sampo Kaasila and Apple Computer. Basically it is because division on a computer (especially when TrueType was made) is slow and division can be achieved quickly by shifting bits if the values are powers of 2.\n\n\\* unitsPerEm should be a power of 2 (2048 ideally).\n\nWhat is a power of 2?  \nA value that is the product of 2 to the power of 'n'. For example, the ideal value of unitsPerEm is 2048. This is the product of 2 to the power of 11.\n\nWhy a power of 2?  \nDivision on computers is a very slow operation. One way programmers get around this problem is to use a technique of shifting bits for division. When a value is a power of 2, division can be performed by simply shifting the bits in the binary of that number. This is extremely fast and efficient.\n\nThis method is similar to dividing by ten in a decimal system. To divide 1000 by 10, you only need to move the decimal place one value to the left. The result is the same as 1000 divided by 10 or 100.0.\n\nWhy 2048?  \n2048 units were chosen for a few reasons:\n\n\\* It is a power of 2 (2 to the 11th power).  \n \\* 2048 is a high enough value for good precision in rendering.  \n \\* 2048 is a low enough value to be processed efficiently by microcomputers.\n\nIn the Asian fonts for Windows, MS Mincho and MS Gothic, it was necessary (at the time of their release) to choose a lower value (256 units) because of the file size of these font files.\n\nThe actual units per em value is a balance between the amount of processing power, the complexity and size of the font file, and the amount of precision that can be obtained with this value. A low units per em value would result in less quality in the output, but be faster to process. A high units per em value would produce a higher quality output, but be slower in processing.\n\nToday, computers are more powerful than ever and the use of large fonts with thousands of glyphs is becoming more common, especially with Unicode and OpenType fonts. With today's computers, we suggest the 2048 units per em value as still the best value for all fonts of any size, including large Latin or non-Latin script fonts.\n\n"

Keep in mind that scaling from an UPM 2000 down to 1000 is the worst case: about every other value has a rounding error of 0.5, which can esily add up to stem inconsistencies.

This means that in order to change something only by one dot at, say 10 pt you need at least 6 units in Fontlab, even if that looks very much on the screen.\n\n"

On the other hand to be fair, they are supplying hinting of the output to solve the more generally problematic Down scaling of type.\n\n\"changing the UPM from 1000 to 2000 with “Scale all glyphs according to UPM size [...then] changing it from 2000 to 2048 without that checkbox checked.  \nI think this is quite an elegant solution to the problem.\"\n\nThis is a solution. It's best employed on 1000 dpi fonts that have no metric history in the outside world as it leaves 1000 and 2048 fonts unmatched vertically. It also says you didn't care for the original relationship twixt design and em by a specific factor. ;)\n\nThere have been a lot of threads here, but fabric fails to form. ;)\n\nThere are two variables in the designer's UPM decision tree: the memory and processing of the composition system, and the characteristics of the type design.\n\nThe OS's big problem with \"real Typography\" was always that the UPM's size alone is not enough of answer upfront \"how big?\" how much memory and etc. ... So, to handle Typography, there are now more numbers and tables in the font formats to answer the question in enough detail. But still, there's got to be a gross maximum unit system upon which, the UPM exists, and the type occupies, mostly within, but not exclusively within the em. That's the truce — we have 16,384 to build: an em (TT) and all the extent we need. But if you use it all on the em! (8x2048 you fools!), don't go outside of that 16,384, please, it could have consequences for all of us. . .\n\nDesign's big problem with the EM is when the level of detail is under-whelmed by resolution. 1000 rarely needs to change for \"normal\" design detail. 2048 rarely needs to change for \"any\" design detail. The Linotype library was built on 8000 something. The Bitstream Library was built on 4320, and the Adobe Library was built on 1,000. So, a designer's got to have something very special to render in a master (small relative to the upm, or large relative to the user), to make one choose something beyond 2048.\n\nI hope that's all true, still.\n\n"

TrueType fonts preferred having the Units per EM (UPM) as a power of two because in all of the scaling of the outlines, one has to continually divide by the UPM. When that is a power of two it is much quicker and can be implemented with a \"shift right\" instruction._\n\nOf course higher UPM size give greater accuracy to the outline data, giving the equivalent of fixed fractional precision, but there is a trade-off in data size. For TrueType, outline data is typically stored as relative distances from the previous point. If the relative distance could be stored in a byte, it would be, otherwise it was stored in a 16-bit value.\n\nThe higher the UPM, the less likely relative distances would fit into a byte. For some of our early Japanese fonts, we used 256 UPM in order to reduce the outline data size. 2048 UPEM was common in TrueType because it seemed like a good balance between data size and accuracy. The range for TrueType and OpenType is between 16 and 16,384 inclusive.\n\nAlso see:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/30727](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223110030/http:/typophile.com/node/30727 \"http://typophile.com/node/30727\")\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"
