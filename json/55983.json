Not so much of a blog, but a portfolio with funky yet functional navigation. It's a nice breather from a lot of traditional computer rendered typography treatments. I've always been keen to getting off the box and hand rendering some letters, but it's much tougher than it seems. Practice I guess...\n\nJohan Vilchez\n\n"
