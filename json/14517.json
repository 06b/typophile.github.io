Featured on their site is the casestudy claiming that \" a custom typeface was develloped\", when in fact, even here on Typophile, a lot of us noticed that it is merely, if at all, an adaptation of the ubiquous FF Dax. So I guess it is safe to suggest you use this typeface if you can't get the \"UPS Sans\" corporate typeface.\n\n"
