  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nLong time no “see”...  \nI have a shameful (for me) question for you: I have drawn letters under Illustrator CS that could actually lead to the whole alphabet, and I’m thinking that it would be great to gather them into an actual font.  \nMatter is I have no idea how to do that...  \nWhat software to use as a start? Is that easy to transfer the actual vector letters I’ve drawn to these softs?  \nThanks a lot for your wisdom and knowledge as usual.  \nCheers,\n\nDr.D\n\n [‹ PS flavoured OT font not showing up in Word (Mac)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014045455/http:/typophile.com/node/32626 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Stylistic Alternatives - Indesign ? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014045455/http:/typophile.com/node/32399 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
