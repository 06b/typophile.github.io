WIth the technology as it is today, is it necessary to start a design in this way? It seems to me that you do keep the rudimentary elements in mind still, but can push forward much quicker without having to worry about test characters. Or not?\n\n"

I think that the main obstacle that I have with the serif is:  \n1. to measure the width with the serif?  \n2. if not - why not?\n\nbut again - I don’t want to be too mechanical or scientific.\n\nright now I’m studying:  \n1. Galliard + Hoefler text  \n2. Futura + Bauhaus (to understand the simple geometric shapes)  \n3. Myriad + Myriad Condensed (to understand what is condensed and to compare it to the regular font)\n\nand the next step:  \ntext vs. display (such as Minion)\n\nand I hope that after that I can start to explore more modern designs.\n\nany thoughts, ideas — you’re welcome.....\n\n"

On the other hand, since serifs **do** exist as more than disposable decoration, the **apparent** width is more important in the end. In fact it’s quite hard -if cozy- to justify reliance on skeletons in type design.\n\nhhp\n\n"
