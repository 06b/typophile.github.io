  "content": "Here's a semi-serious idea that actually could happen, depending ..\n\nTwo of my oldest friends are 5ish weeks away from having their first baby, and they're nowhere near a sense of what to name the lil pup. They're both designery and bookish, and quite like type. In fact, she's sitting across from me and just exclaimed \"Pica! We'll name it Pica! Or .. Franklin!\"\n\nSo, if you had to choose a type-inspired name for a baby, boy or girl, what would it be?\n\nAll the reasonable guidelines apply, for example nothing unpronounceable or humiliating. Like, not 'Slug'. :)\n\nthanks!\n\n",
