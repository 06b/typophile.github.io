  "content": "Hi, here's a experiment series i made in blackletter, first the are two styles Africana and Europea, the difference between them is the position of a 90º angle. There is also small caps based upon some attemps in the letterings i see in the streets ( i'm from Mexico, and we use lots of blackletter for anything)ended looking like lettering of heavy metal logos.\n\nThere's a more detailed preview in behance, but the version attached here is more updated  \n [http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Golondrina-Africana-\\_amp-Europea/427447](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318000435/http:/www.behance.net/Gallery/Golondrina-Africana-_amp-Europea/427447 \"http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Golondrina-Africana-\\_amp-Europea/427447\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [especimen.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318000435/http:/typophile.com/files/especimen_0.png) | 398.51 KB |\n\n",

No calligraphic origin remains, those characters look (%, & etc.) like they were laid down with electrical tape, not a pen.\n\n"
