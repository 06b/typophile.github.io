(As far as I know though, most of their formal schooling was Anglo.) Anyway, they felt that when a excalm- or questiondown was followed by a capital letter, the exclam- questiondown should ride on the baseline, otherwise, it should not.\n\nWe wrote a simple calt feature to take care of this\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043209im_/http:/typophile.com/files/down_5956.gif)\n  \nWhere (F) is foundry, and (1) and (2) show the added calt feature.\n\nAny thoughts before we consider adding this to other fonts (where the license permits).\n\n",
