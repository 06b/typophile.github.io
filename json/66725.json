On iPad Eve I feel, as book designer, editor and typographer, much the same excitement that came with the introduction of quality paperbacks in the 1950s. Our book culture cannot without mediation just be republished in new media. All our typographical skills are needed to make the tablets function in a humane and literate way and thereby assist the survival of the book.\n\n"

But I don’t think it’s available on any mobile or e-reader platforms.\n\nSetting aside the licensing etc. issues of @font-face, my question is whether the Apple iPad e-book software will support @font-face embedded fonts, or is only selectable among system-installed fonts. I suspect the latter, unfortunately. And it will probably be a closed system typographically, like the iPhone and iPod.\n\nIf by some chance it does support @font-face, then the next question will be whether it supports WOFF.

I had a feeling I was missing something.\n\n@all  \nRan across one wag's thumbnail analysis of the iPad that rings true to me as far as the iPad as an e-book reader:\n\n“As for the Kindle comparisons...  \nThe Kindle is $259. The Kindle DX (similar screen size to the iPad) is $489. Both include free 3g connectivity and have battery life of a week.  \nThe same functionality on the iPad would cost $629 (for the 16Gb with 3G) and then $180 a year for the low plan of 3G wireless access. And your battery would only last 10 hours, so you'd need to plug it in all the time. Plus, the books seem to be about 50% more expensive than on the Kindle. So, as a straight ebook reader, it loses.  \nIts advantage comes in being more than that. Unfortunately, it's not all it could be. It's basically an iPod Touch with a big screen. No camera (for Skype), no Adobe Flash, no USB ports, no SD expandability, no multitasking, no real PC apps (OpenOffice.org, Firefox, etc).”\n\n"
