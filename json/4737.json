(I consider these improvements :-) I changed quite a few other things in it, such as adding a ton of alternate characters and new weights and styles.   \n   \nI don't know of any available digital versions of the original under its real name (i.e., China) but there are some out there with other names such as [Camp Caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525174244/http:/www.castcraft-software.com/cgi-bin/castcraft/dc2.02?135%2C256) if you need to match it exactly.\n\n"
