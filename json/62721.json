Well, I do, and I'm still trying to decide what the visual identity of my small art company, which I've had since high school, should look like. I've bounced between numerous hand drawn logos and fonts but I've never felt certain about anything.\n\nAnyways, here's something I'm working on that seems to fit alright with me. I especially like how I can easily turn this into a stamp for biz cards and what not.\n\nThey are both Ziggurat but I've added cuts into the 2nd one. BTW - I'm trying to go for a playful industrious look that looks modern.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logos.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108094940/http:/typophile.com/files/logos_0.gif) | 20.91 KB |\n\n",

I do rather like how in the 2nd one, your added cuts make it a little more friendly.\n\nWhat if you tilted the \"O\" in Eggroll? (like an egg rolling? perhaps that is too much of a play on words?

I definitely want it to look playful but not like it belongs on a Fisher Price toy if you get my drift.\n\nEggroll Industries is an independent gig I've had since high school. The name comes from my nickname \"Eggroll\" that my friends gave me a long time ago b/c I'm half asian. I started the company with one of my friends silkscreening and airbrushing skateboards for a lot of people. Then, it evolved to silkscreening tees. Four years later, today, I'm still highly passionate about art but haven't really tried to sell anything. So, I'm designing and developing an online store (I also make websites), that will sell nearly everything I create. If people buy it, awesome, and if not I will still have a massive online portfolio. However, I'm trying to shift from freelance web design to just focusing on my art so the branding it pretty important to me.\n\nI tried out the tilted 'O' below.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108094940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabserifs-blue_3519.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "It's your logo so the debate between the true vector version and the hand drawn will probably have to be solved internally.\n\nI think you might try out different ways of making the logotype relate to your artist's handiwork. Perhaps show a version that keeps the original outlines but uses the rough ink typically seen in a lot of silkscreen (see image). [http://www.birminghamprintmakers.org/images/silkScreen.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108094940/http:/www.birminghamprintmakers.org/images/silkScreen.jpg \"http://www.birminghamprintmakers.org/images/silkScreen.jpg\")\n\nPersonally I thought the tilting of the O was a clever addition, but the space between the R and the O is really bothersome. I think you should try and create a ligature of the two letterforms to bridge that gap.\n\n"

As you can see I'm all over the place in terms of what it should look like. I liked the first one, but I couldn't get 'industries' to fit underneath 'eggroll' without the d hitting the 2 'g's'.\n\nI think I may have to go back to the drawing board on my logo...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108094940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/attempt_1_3851.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108094940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/attempt_2_5940.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108094940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/attempt_3_3958.jpg)\n\n"

The traced vector approach looks cool, though I am reminded of an ancient beer brewery or something—but, regardless, it's strong and doesn't take itself too seriously. In your latest sketches, I really dig #3's \"R\" since it looks like a big grin, and the whole thing is simply imaginative.\n\nI think, if you're going to try a completely different direction, keep in mind your targeted audience. I don't think you should fuss too much about kerning or other concerns corporate identity work might need to address since this mark you're making is so personal.\n\n"
