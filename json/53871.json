Not every font had some of the characters you're asking about specially drawn. But many did.\n\nIn the case of Electra, I know that Dwiggins did in fact draw these characters. I have copies of some of his sketches, including alternates that did not get chosen for production. When I have a chance later today or this weekend, I'll scan some samples to post.\n\n((BTW, I assume that this revival is just for an academic exercise and that you don't intend to release anything without permission. Linotype still owns the intellectual property and the trademarks for Electra. Are you in the same class as Abi?))\n\n-- Kent.\n\n"

For whatever reason, in the end, all of those were the shapes that he chose (perhaps with CHG's influence). Remember, you don't want the special characters to distract too much in text.\n\nHere are images of some of Dwiggins's sketches for a few of those special characters. I apologize for the quality, as these are scanned from photocopies. The originals are in the CH Griffith Archives at the University of Kentucky, Lexington.\n\nAt this point, Dwiggins is working in ink at 10 x 12 pt size (he didn't begin working in the larger, pencil outlines until Caledonia). These scans are actual size at 100ppi. Sorry for the scrolling on the last one.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016231309im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Electra_ink_UK-E47_5129.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016231309im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Electra_ink_UK-E137_6483.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016231309im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Electra_ink_UK-E138_4199.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016231309im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Electra_ink_UK-E141_5821.gif)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe note at the bottom of card [E138] says \"Hard to make a § that fits the Electra snap. Try again after you see this lot.\"\n\nThe note at the bottom of card [E141], under the ampersand, says \"Attempt to get a flourished 'and' in the Electra feeling.\"\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have dates for these. WAD wasn't as diligent about dating things at this stage as he was later. The card numbers are Griffith's cataloging. They may or may not indicate any chronology.\n\n-- Kent.\n\n"

[period] as furnished seems light to me, and I am not quite sure about Griff's apostrophes, commas, etc., but let em ride for present?\"\n\nYou'll notice that the final comma is nothing like what WAD drew here.\n\nThe period and comma would have likely been put in by drawing office initially, probably pulled from some standard. Because WAD mentions Griffith in the third person here, I'm not sure who he would have been addressing with this comment. If this were Metro, I would say he might have been talking to Gage, who remained involved in some of the process throughout.\n\nMore likely in this case he's talking to Larson, head of the drawing office. But, I'm not sure his sketches would have gone straight to Larson without first passing through CHG, so this particular comment is curious.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

WAD would have overseen and approved the Emblems specimen. An Alfred A Knopf book designed and overseen by WAD himself (like _Not Under Forty_ by Willa Cather, or _The Borzoi Reader_ edited by Carl van Doren -- both 1936, right after Electra's release) might have made for a more authentic exemplar than a 50s Dutch book, but that's a small matter.\n\nOriginal sketches might give additional insight, but they cannot be followed slavishly (as DB points out so succinctly), since they were a means to an end -- that end being the printed type in everyday use. What Dwiggins and his peers knew as Electra is what we can all see in the books they made, not the drawings that started the process.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
