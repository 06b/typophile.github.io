  "content": "Hi! This is my first posting on typophile and though my question isn’t specifically typography realated, I do need educated opinions on a debate that I’m having with my (non-designer) boss.\n\nOur company has recently been rebranded and I am tasked with redesigning everything. First off business cards. Now rather than go the entirely traditional route (name, title, address, numbers, email, webpage etc) I wanted to ditch the name line, and just do email. Everyone’s email in the company is [first.last@ourcompany.com](mailto:first.last@ourcompany.com) Similar to this:\n\n[http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u123/lynzee34/businesscardexample.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080102021431/http:/i167.photobucket.com/albums/u123/lynzee34/businesscardexample.jpg \"http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u123/lynzee34/businesscardexample.jpg\")\n\nI have seen it done on just a handful of cards and I love it. I think it’s sleek and very modern. My boss of course hates it, but I want to know what other trained eyes think. Am I pushing foward our medium or am I going against graphic design dogma? Should I keep fighting the good fight or am a wasting my time with a battle that shouldn’t even be considered?\n\n [‹ Concert Ticket Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20080102021431/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16768 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Who knows this Font?

But a phone number is really a must on a business card (unless people at the company just don’t have phones)—if you leave the phone number off for the sake of the design, the design has broken the function of the piece, and thus it is a bad design.\n\n"

Worked fine until we had an asian last name of Ong, first name with a “B”... [bong@thecomapny.com](mailto:bong@thecomapny.com) just didn’t fit.\n\nIt sounds like an idea to use on a freelance job. Then your design-challenged, corporate-man boss has no say as to how creative you want to be.\n\n"

Having your personal identity represented by an e-mail sounds insulting to the individual. Plus, what’s your point? What are you trying to say? Is it a meaningful design decision? Are you trying to save ink? It’s not a “good fight” if it’s a pointless design whim.\n\n"

That’s not the way to think about it. It’s really more of a branding issue - and the card’s functionality. You can make it look great either way. I think you’re wasting your time if you try to convince your boss on terms of design. And you run the risk of making him think designers don’t know what they’re talking about, which could come to bite you in the ass down the road.\n\n"

      "content": "I think the concept is good. Nice simple clean design. But you kinda gotta think of the purpose of a business card & the market your targeting. It’s a contact card that represents a business as well as an individual. A phone number is still an essential element in contact information. Even though it seems highly unlikely there are still many people to this day who do not have a computer nor the internet. Another suggestion when presenting a concept to your boss you may want to present more than one idea because although your the designer they are the boss and it will always be that way! If he has design skills or not. He has a vision of what he wants. So try giving him more then one option to choose from. It always seemed to work for me with my boss. Hopefully I gave you some useful information!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for all the imput guys— but this isn’t my card. I was just asking about combinding the name/email into one line and provided that card above as an example incase my description wasn’t clear.\n\nMy card still has office, cell, and fax numbers as well as our address and website. Sorry for the confusion!\n\nMy original question was pertaining to if everyone thought the combination of name/email was an okay thing to do or if it was against graphic design dogma— like trying to pass off Optimum as Optima.\n\nFurther info: We are a medium sized (1000+ employee)document management/business process company who is rebranding themselves as “Powered by technology. Perfected by people.” We switched to Helvetica for our logo, a logo mark that is abstract people, and am trying to brand outselves as people serving people, customer oriented. So I thought with the combination of the name/email was a young, different, “breaks from the traditional”, typographic way to relay our new image.\n\nThoughts?\n\n"

It’s a content/branding issue and waving the graphic design stick at your boss seems misdirected. If you want to convince him to keep it that simple, you should be talking about the image of the company, not graphic design. As a designer your job is to come up with an innovative solution either way.\n\n"
