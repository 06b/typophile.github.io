  "content": "I found this image via an online photo archive belonging to an artist here in the NL. I'm no typographer but it looks like a slightly wider version of Arial Rounded MT, no? Particular attention towards P, L, C, M, E, and S... very rounded, even 'techno/space-like'. After exhausting the powers of online type queries I am hoping that someone here can help identify this particular face. One thing the artist mentioned was that it was highly possible it was a free font and dated around 2008.\n\nI know the text itself might be small but I think it's possible to make out the differences of the type.\n\nThanks a lot, Typophiles! : )\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918110215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled_6028.jpg)\n\n",
