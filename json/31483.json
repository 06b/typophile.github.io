I've followed he advise in this article but on-screen fonts still seem jaggered.\n\nDoes anyone know of any other tutorials on this.\n\nc.\n\n",

My vfb have an em of 1000 cos I'm generating OTF fonts, can I use these vfb to export the TTF fonts without changing the em, cos the em square of the TT fonts is meant to be 2048.\n\nc.\n\n"
