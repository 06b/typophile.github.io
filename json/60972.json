I’ve been designing this custom typeface under the creative direction of Michael Gericke and Luke Hayman.\n\nIt’s currently being used on [the GoUsaBid.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090817225421/http:/www.gousabid.com/page/invite/trailer) site. I’ve been incredibly excited to see what the talented designers at Pentagram are doing with the typeface. Look forward to a future Pentagram blog post with all the applications of the bid message and ’Game’ typeface.\n\n———————————————————-  \n [Read Between the Leading podcast](http://web.archive.org/web/20090817225421/http:/rbtl.us/) | [Pixelspread](http://web.archive.org/web/20090817225421/http:/pixelspread.com/) | [Pentagram](http://web.archive.org/web/20090817225421/http:/pentagram.com/)\n\n",

Definitely a unique look, and good to see our national team becoming more design aware/focused ( [ussoccer.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090817225421/http:/www.ussoccer.com/) was also just redesigned). Nice work, I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on the blog.\n\n"
