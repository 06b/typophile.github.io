I've seen it on several embroidery sites, but it's just called curly script or classic monogram, etc.\n\nThank you in advance for any help or pointers.\n\nBobbi Jo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141104203750im_/http:/typophile.com/files/curly%20script_5251.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [curly script.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141104203750/http:/typophile.com/files/curly%20script_0.jpg) | 10.7 KB |\n\n",

Harold Lohner has about the best collection of Monogram fonts I know and his [Vine Monograms](http://web.archive.org/web/20141104203750/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=HAFO-VIMO) are as close to your sample as i can recall.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Hello Mike,\n\nThanks so much for your response. Yes, I love Harold's monogram fonts. Just purchased his original monogram set a few weeks ago and it works great for embroidery lettering. :)\n\nI don't have his vine font, but it's tempting. :)\n\nI'll keep searching for this one and hopefully if it doesn't exist in ttf format yet maybe someone will do it eventually. Wish I knew how...\n\nThanks again!  \nBobbi Jo\n\n"
