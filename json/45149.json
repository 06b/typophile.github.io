The cookies are great but the design on the packaging sucks (at least according to the Instructor).  \n [http://www.magnificentgifts.com/members/821963/uploaded/ASC-8.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010643/http:/www.magnificentgifts.com/members/821963/uploaded/ASC-8.jpg \"http://www.magnificentgifts.com/members/821963/uploaded/ASC-8.jpg\")\n\nCan you guys recommend a typeface for the company name \"Alice's Stick cookies\" and maybe another face to go with the (miscellaneous) text on the box?  \nI'm going for something that looks contemporary, yet organic, and something that feels a bit sophisticated but not 'elitist' since these are gourmet cookies afterall. Also, the typeface must be available in Font Folio.\n\nThe cookies are shaped-like biscotti if that helps in any way.\n\nIf you also have any other ideas on how to approach this, please feel free to chime in.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

However, you have a manageable number to choose from and you know where they are, so knuckle down and plough through the Font Folio, and build a short list.\n\n"

      "content": "Trial and error, right. You have to use your imagination as you're looking through a selection of candidate faces, asking yourself not only \"Does this suit the criteria?\" but more importantly, \"How could I make this suit the criteria?\"\n\nTypefaces certainly have connotations which typographers and graphic designers are aware of, but the reader is unaware of these. For the reader, the meaning derives from the page as a whole. Consider blackletter: what vibe does the reader pick up from such a style, Christmas or Fascism? (To name but two.) The designer decides.\n\nWhether a typeface will be perceived as ’contemporary’, ’elegant’, friendly’, or ’neutral’ depends on how you use it. Choice of style (weight, slant, horizontal scale), size, color, tracking--these are decisive.\n\n"

I showed my Instructor what I've came up with yesterday and she liked the last one the best(which I also liked the best too) then the fifth one out of 10 roughs. I'm still playing around with roughs and layouts. I narrowed it down to Cronos and Optima for my logotype.\n\nHere are links of the original piece to be re-designed and my roughs\n\nOriginal  \n [http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/8761/originalid5.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010643/http:/img185.imageshack.us/img185/8761/originalid5.jpg \"http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/8761/originalid5.jpg\")\n\nFirst Choice (Cronos)  \n [http://img135.imageshack.us/img135/4033/firstchoicenm1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010643/http:/img135.imageshack.us/img135/4033/firstchoicenm1.jpg \"http://img135.imageshack.us/img135/4033/firstchoicenm1.jpg\")\n\nFirst Choice revised with Optima  \n [http://img368.imageshack.us/img368/4738/firstchoicerevta1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010643/http:/img368.imageshack.us/img368/4738/firstchoicerevta1.jpg \"http://img368.imageshack.us/img368/4738/firstchoicerevta1.jpg\")\n\nSecond Choice (Cronos)  \n [http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/5833/2ndchoicejz4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010643/http:/img294.imageshack.us/img294/5833/2ndchoicejz4.jpg \"http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/5833/2ndchoicejz4.jpg\")\n\nComments?

      "content": "Mirko,\n\nA few first view thoughts of \"firstchoicenm1\":\n\n- If the photo is full-color, why not have more color everywhere?  \n- Are the cookies beautiful enough to merit a die-cut? If they are, what color are they? You'll want the color of the cookies to be harmonious with everything else you choose.  \n- Could the lemons be used more dramatically? Does it have to be a photo?\n\nI'll add that at this point the type isn't necessarily bad. I like Cronos. Again, once the packaging takes on more direction you'll know more of how/where to use the type.\n\n"
