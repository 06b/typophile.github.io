There might be a thread, but my advanced search (using google) doesn't show anything on the first 5 pages.\n\nMovies such as:  \n [Tarantula](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173104/http:/www.allposters.com/gallery.asp?CID=D09B04D472DB428097E091E17D96C469&startat=/getposter.asp%3FAPNum%3D936221%26CID%3DD09B04D472DB428097E091E17D96C469%26PPID%3D1%26search%3Dvintage%2520movie%26f%3Dt%26FindID%3D0%26P%3D1%26PP%3D24%26sortby%3DRD%26cname%3D%26SearchID%3D)  \n [\"THEM\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173104/http:/www.allposters.com/gallery.asp?CID=d09b04d472db428097e091e17d96c469&startat=/getposter.asp%3FCID%3Dd09b04d472db428097e091e17d96c469%26PPID%3D1%26apnum%3D936647%26search%3D42011%26f%3Dc%26FindID%3D42011%26SearchID%3D)\n\nThis is a type ID thread it is a \"let's create a thread where we can list great vintage horror movie fonts\" thread. Unless, of course, it already exists. Just show me and I'll close this thread down. No need to be redundant.\n\nEdit: Use Allposters.com for more inspiration. If you find a movie that you particularly like go ahead and link it here.\n\n",
