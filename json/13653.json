The Typophiles is a not-for-profit educational association that encourages the appreciation and production of fine typography and bookmaking. Individually, a Typophile may be a typographer, an art director, a printer, a librarian, an artist, a publisher, a paper salesperson, a designer, a binder, a calligrapher, a bookseller, a collector, or a teacher. What brings us together is enthusiasm for fine books and typography.\n\nFrom the early days, when [Bruce Rogers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230636/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bruce%20Rogers) and [Fred Goudy](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230636/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fred%20Goudy) were among those who informally lunched together, down to the present time, beautifully printed Typophile Chap Books, monographs, and keepsakes have been produced as a labor of love. These publications are examples of the highest standards, with members contributing their talent and time to produce books that have become treasured collector's items. A new monograph series is now being published annually to great acclaim and distributed to all members as one of the perquisites of membership.\n\nAlthough the regular luncheon meetings and the fabled Christmas luncheon party are traditionally held in New York, you need not live in the New York area to be a Typophile. All members automatically receive publications such as the annual monograph and have the privilege of buying Chap Books at the special member's price.\n\n[http://www.typophiles.com/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010230636/http:/www.typophiles.com/index.html \"http://www.typophiles.com/index.html\")\n\n",
