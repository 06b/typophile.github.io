(New York printer [Darius Wells](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110741/http:/www.woodtype.org/museum_information_about.shtml) was the first to mass-produce wood type, in 1827.)\n\nSee also:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/31623674@N00/529230502](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110741/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/31623674@N00/529230502 \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31623674@N00/529230502\")\n\n[http://famousamericans.net/dariuswells/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110741/http:/famousamericans.net/dariuswells/ \"http://famousamericans.net/dariuswells/\")\n\n[EDIT] Luc Devroye has a page on wood type, and it has some international names in there:\n\n[http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/wood.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110741/http:/cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/wood.html \"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/wood.html\")\n\n"
