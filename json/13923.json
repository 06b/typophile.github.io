  "content": "Ok, I am taking the previous advice and concentrating solely on the logo now. I have spoken with the client in much detail regarding the nature of fiberoptics and done my own research as well. Please give me your thoughts on the new logo I am working on.\n\nTo refresh memories:  \n• Business is a network design firm specializing in fiberoptic and UTP transmission of packetized digital audio.  \n• They would like to emphasize the fiberoptic approach since it is higher bandwidth, hence more reliable for realtime applications.  \n• Their clients are looking for the complete design and installation of a digital audio network in the following locations: broadcast studios, recording studios, performance venues, stadiums, clubs, campuses.  \n• Largest competitor is [Ascent Media](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215654/http:/www.afassoc.com/), although Ascent is working a much larger demographic.  \n• Their primary needs for identity are website, storefront, letterhead, invoice, and business cards.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [new-logo-fiberpack.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215654/http:/typophile.com/files/new-logo-fiberpack.gif) | 8.71 KB |\n| [new-logo-expanded-fiberpack.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215654/http:/typophile.com/files/new-logo-expanded-fiberpack.gif) | 9.17 KB |\n| [new-logo-expanded2.1-fiberp.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215654/http:/typophile.com/files/new-logo-expanded2.1-fiberp.gif) | 10.99 KB |\n| [fiberpack-logo-trio.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215654/http:/typophile.com/files/fiberpack-logo-trio.gif) | 24.81 KB |\n\n",

Leave the name in orange but make it a lighter orange to contrast better with the gray (tone wise they are to close), try making the tagline white or a tint of the gray and the artwork either white or tint of gray or orange. Make a hierarchy of what is important, like: Name number one, Tagline number two and Graphic number three. What is happening now is everything is vieing for the same attention.\n\n"

The audio device at the side looks a bit sonar, try rotating it to parallel with the type.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "You have all offered very helpful suggestions as usual! Thanks.\n\nDan and Timd, you are correct of course. I approached the outline the wrong way and ended up distorting the negative space inside the characters. You will find this corrected. My intent was not to outline the characters, as much as to fill the characters with a double line. Or rather to draw them with a double line in the first place. I could not figure out how to do this in Illustrator, short of carefully editing each character by hand, so I faked it with an outline. I believe this new version conveys the idea a little better.\n\nIt is meant to portray the look of the most popular type of fiber optic cable used. It is a duplex style (2 cables seamed together) in bright orange. If you were to have an install by this company you would most likely see this cable everywhere. And having seen the logo you will hopefully remember forever who did it.\n\n[Here’s the new version](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215654/http:/typophile.com/files/new-logo-expanded-fiberpack.gif)\n\n"

The letters are starting to merge into one another and form different shapes.\n\nNow the tagline is too light, almost to the point of “why should it be there”?\n\nThe fading audio boxes to the right of the O actually work against the logo. I believe they subliminaly suggest that the product is of low quality, since they are so weak and faded.\n\nI do like what you have started with the O. It is developing into a mark. I would explore that further.\n\n"

Please bear with me, I know I have posted alot on this project. :) Thanks!\n\n[Here’s all 3 latest designs](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215654/http:/typophile.com/files/fiberpack-logo-trio.gif)\n\n"

I guess if you refine the “loop” a little more it could be a candidate.\n\n#3 is still the strongest, but those teeny, tiny marks inside the O will disappear at a smaller size, like on a business card.\n\n#1 is too difficult to read and there are awkward joins between the two words. Something I want to point out-when “fusing” two shapes, letterforms or otherwise, you need to be aware of not only the shape you are creating, but the shape of the negative area as well. On #1, there is a weird negative space between the k and the upside-down A. Something to remember for future designs.\n\n"

Don’t give the client an opportunity to choose an inferior design, because most of the time they will.\n\nI agree with adnix. From a compositional perspective, #3 is by far the strongest — but the “O“‘s internals might get lost a smaller sizes. My eye tells me that there is perhaps too much going on around the “O,” which distracts from the typography.\n\n"

      "content": "You are getting the contrast and prioritizing aspect of your logo. Avoid gradients as in number 2 they cause production problems and it will come back to bite you. Number 1 looks like a mistake, Audio doesn’t read. As I noted before number 3 will fall apart or fill-in in small sizes. I also suggest trying to make anything you design work in black and white (tints of black are fine). The reason is any fatal design flaws can be hidden by color. Also test your designs at the smallest size you know they will be used. One last note do not let your client take a piece from one design and a piece from another design, that is how the Camel was made.\n\n"
