  "content": "Recently, Andi Emery started a topic asking if teaching [traditional copyfitting](http://web.archive.org/web/20120107045148/http:/typophile.com/node/14469) methods to graphic designers had value anymore. This is a question of particual interest to educators who want to improve typographic awareness in students.\n\nGiven the fact that typography is a minor sub-set in most general graphic design programs, it sparked an interest in exploring types of exercises that might stimulate creative and cognitive abilities useful to budding typographers and type designers.\n\nThe topic of type education already exists under the heading of [**Typographic Edumacators**](http://web.archive.org/web/20120107045148/http:/typophile.com/node/694) within the _Special Interest Groups_ area of Typophile. This topic area is sadly malnurished having only two replies to an important topic started by Nathan Matteson over two years ago! All of the real dialogs related to education are actually peppered throughout the entire Typophile forum.\n\n'Nuf said.\n\n**If Typography was a Video Game**  \nThis is a thought that came to my mind after participating in Andi's topic. No, I'm not advocating a game blasting Comic Sans with laser guns, or a Sim game trying to pickup type hotties at a party. I'm not even suggesting an \"educational\" game a la Sesame Street or Nick Jr. (though they're wonderfully useful).\n\nI'm thinking more in the line of simple, engaging and hopefully stimulating exercises that might trigger higher cognitive and creative activities in the mind of students. Obviously this doesn't need to take the form of a video game, but the only reason it came to mind is that all designers are now trained in front of a screen.\n\nHere goes my first shot:\n\n[**Tangram**](http://web.archive.org/web/20120107045148/http:/enchantedmind.com/puzzles/tangram/tangram.html)  \nIs this ancient Chinese game (or variant) useful in developing a heightened sense of notan?  \nCan it help designers to create a plethora of recognizable shapes using only a fixed set of elements?\n\nDescription (From Answers.com)  \nTangram (Hanyu Pinyin: Cantonese: ch'i ch'ae pan; literally Seven-Board of Cunning) is an ancient Chinese puzzle.  \nIt consists of 7 pieces, called Tans, which fit together to form a square:  \n5 triangles of various sizes,  \n1 square  \n1 parallelogram  \nThe objective is to form a given shape with seven pieces.  \nThe shape has to contain all the pieces, which must not overlap.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI can already see that exploring helpful tools and methods of developing typographic sensibilities will be a slow and laborous mission, as it has taken me a considerable amount of time just to get this post up. Hopefully a few of us can collectively hatch up some worthwhile exercises. I've got a few more simple activities to share, but it takes time to really think them through.\n\nLook for the \"Typography Edumacators\" topic area to come alive again.\n\n",

I have great admiration for the more skilled practitioners of the art, who seem able to coax an immense range of images out of what is really a rather limited tool set.\n\nAnother exercise which might prove helpful in developing typesense would be a game which has rules, but they are not spelled out at the beginning of the game: the purpose of the game is, in fact, to discover the rules.

Then give them the ho and ask to design the bd. This would have to be in Illustrator or Fontlab, though. If you did the same thing for four or five diverse classics, it would be incredibly educational, I think.\n\n"

More so that the days of yore anyway. I haven't been as active of a participant as I used to be -- teaching's been taking up more and more of my time -- but I hope to make some more time to participate in this sort of discussion.\n\nAlthough, quite frankly, I'm conflicted as to the idea of turning typography too much into a 'game'. Students today seem completely different than when I was in college (a mere 10 years ago), but I buck at the thought of 'coddling' them. I'm sure it's not coddling, it's just change, but so much of what I hear about typography classes (not on this board, mind you) sounds like either (1) teachers obsfucate things to make their practice seem overly esoteric/important, or (2) the classroom becomes a playpen that panders to students' lack of attention.\n\nUnfortunately, in the meantime I have to prepare for class :-P so ta-ta-for-now.\n\n"

Thanks.\n\nmatteson,  \nmy take on exploring this area is slightly different than many of the design curriculums I am aware of. My personal intent is to find methods, tools, or exercises that MIGHT aid students of general graphic design programs to step through the portal of typographic awareness.\n\nIn other words, my own personal interest is to help \"wake up\" and heighten those mysterious powers of super type awareness which lay dormant in only a handful of students.\n\nI have asked myself many times, why can some people look at a full page of straight text and see the continuity or irregularities of type color, the _dazzle_ or _spikeyness_, the need for an addition point of line spacing, or understand why the column should be extended by 4 picas, and finally decide that one vendor's version of Cheltenham should be replaced by a slightly different version to feel right.\n\nThese are abilities I have seen in very few graphic designers. If playing Tangram or Tetris during lunch helps to build these awarenesses, then I'm all for them.\n\nAgain, I don't want to build \"games.\" I want to find out if there is any sort of activity, on screen or off, which can help raise that awareness. It seems a dumb analogy, but I keep remembering the scenes in _Karate Kid_ where the student develops exceptional blocking abilities by waxing cars using only two specific movements of _Wax on_ and _Wax off_.\n\nI immensely respect the expertise and efforts of the many qualified and fully trained educators who build knowledge and train their students in design and typography.\n\n"

It's how I feel about my past students.
