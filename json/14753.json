It looks pretty awkward to write. What’s the deal? The rest of the characters look simple enough.\n\n- Chris\n\n",

      "content": "even _the 2-storey ‘a’ and the binocular ‘g’_ have handwritten origins. take a look at the [carolingian minuscule](http://web.archive.org/wiki/carolingian%20minuscule) and you’ll see both in a calligraphic hand. the same is true for [cyrillic](http://web.archive.org/wiki/cyrillic) letters: they were all based on handwritten models. It is true that some were tweaked to become the cyrillic alphabet we are used to seeing today, but even the old [poluustav](http://web.archive.org/wiki/poluustav) models correlate quite strongly with the forms that are used today. To better understand where these letter forms are coming from, i’d recomment [Vladimir Yefimov](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Vladimir%20Yefimov)’s article on “ [Civil Type](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Civil%20Type) and Kis Cyrillic,” which can be found in [Language Culture Type](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Language%20Culture%20Type).\n\n"

      "content": "Every character has a largely chirographic, but also some lapidary\\*, origin. But the future? That’s up to us. And in something like the Cyrillic De, it might in fact be a good time to reform it (although pragmatically, always).\n\n\\* Consider for example that the Greeks made entire letterform stems and such with single strikes of the chisel (see Catich).\n\nhhp\n\n"
