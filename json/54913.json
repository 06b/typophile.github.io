Might be tough to find something heavy for display, but with modest contrast and classical serif structure.\n\nSubstantial, titling, and bracketed serifs usually leads to high contrast. Conversely, substantial and low contrast usually leads to slab or wedge serifs.\n\nWhat about something like [Iowan Old Style Black](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020220612/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/iowan-old-style/black-osf-bt/)?\n\n"
