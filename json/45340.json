  "content": "Hello All,\n\nI’ve tried this on Adobe’s InDesign discussion group but to no avail. We’re in InDesign CS3, in Windows XP.\n\nWe have a font that InDesign CS3 is seeing as a different name on just one of four computers. In other words, 3 computers see the name as “My TNTFont” but that one computer is seeing it as “My TNT Font” (an extra space btween “TNT” and “Font”).\n\nThis is a font we created (in an older version of Fontographer) and I’m nearly sure the name was changed recently, likely since it was used on the troublesome computer (still no other computers have the problem). I tried deleting all those silly .lst files that Adobe puts all over the place but to no avail. All the computers are pointing at the same font files on a network drive.\n\nDoes any one know of any other places where a list of fonts might be kept or some other thing that InD is reading? We are using ATM to load fonts and there are other .lst files in the fonts folder but I’m leary of deleting those.\n\nThanks a bunch in advance for any help offered,\n\nYours in the font quagmire,  \nKen\n\n [‹ CMYK TO PMS](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706102637/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45408 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [ITC Lubalin Graph by Elsner+Flake vs ITC Lubalin Graph ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706102637/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45375 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Are all computers displaying the same path?\n\nI suspect the one computer showing a different name has the old font installed somewhere.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706102637im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/FindFont_4474.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Well, I found a work around but, alas, Adobe has defeated/deflated my by hiding something, somewhere in which a font name is associated with a font FILEname.\n\nMiguel: The font find dialog shows it as missing, no path was shown.\n\nI decided to rename ANOTHER font and had the same issues. I was UNABLE to get InDesign to display the new font names (it was a family). I deleted every adobefnt\\*.lst file I could find as well as the c:\\Windows\\system32\\FNTCACHE.DAT (hoping against hope) but to no avail. InDesign was still showing the old font names.\n\nWondering WHAT InD could be looking at, I renamed the font FILE and reloaded the new fonts, opened InDesign, used those fonts (which now showed the correct names!!!) and closed InDesign. Loading the fonts from a different location did NOT do it, I had to rename the font file. After closing InD, unloading the renamed font files and reloading the original font files, from the original locations, InD displayed the names correctly.\n\nSo, somewhere, somehow InD associates font names, with font FILEnames.\n\nJust rediculous.\n\nAll the best and thanks for the help.  \nKen\n\n"
