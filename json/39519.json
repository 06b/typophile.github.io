There’s no arguing with those sentiments.\n\nIn spite of never having the great good fortune seeing anything as inspirational as the original drawings of Gill Sans (where do they sit?) I can identify with most of what you say.\n\nMy only reason for intervening was because I felt we sometimes tend to be rather backward-looking when it comes to these things. Not being a web designer, I still do not really miss the tactile element in my work, but I agree with you that an earlier era of printing/typography offered kinds of satisfaction that were qualitatively different (not necessarily better) from what we get today.\n\nYou’ll surely agree that typography like any craft can retain it’s robustness only if it redefines itself continually. And in that sense to call metal-type the real thing is to somewhat discount all the work that has happened post-letterpress.... the works of a Frutiger, or a Spekermann can’t be any less the real thing just because the dominant reproduction process of our time is not letterpress\n\nAgain, as I said, I’m not arguing with what you say.

Will Powers, Kent Lew yes. I’m a type designer, hoping to be good at that. Middling typographer (very old-fashioned).\n\nI have been fascinated with the idea of hand-cutting punches for a typeface and having it produced. It certainly isn’t a practical idea, as it would take so much time and effort, but I appreciate the tactile attraction of the materials. I remember the way I felt when I first got a proof of my type off a laser printer (electric!), and I imagine I’d feel the same seeing my types chugging out of a Monotype caster.\n\nPart of my fascination is seeing the 3 types that Rudolf Koch cut by hand for machine production; they really have something marvelous in them; there’s something ineffable when type is cut at the same size it’s cast. Each size has to be different, so they are more like versions; interpretations, like with Caslon.\n\nI own a small press but it needs a part, and I have zero metal type. No room for that yet.\n\n"

Pied, for anyone who hasn’t spent time in a print shop (like me until three months ago), means that the type was jumbled; the printer decided it wasn’t worth resorting it all.\n\nIf anyone’s in New Haven in the future, I do recommend seeing if you can stop in for a bit — we have seven presses, if I remember correctly, platen, hand, and Vandercook.

But first, to answer your question, sadly, I have no metal types.\n\nBack in the late 1960s, as a high school freshman, in New York, I had to take a sampling of “shop” classes, once of which was printing. For one-quarter of the school year we set real, metal type and printed stuff. Although I remember the awful wooden footstool I made in the quarter-semester woodshop (I later chose tech electronics as the shop class for the three years that followed), for the life of me I haven’t a clue to anything specific we printed.\n\nI wish to God I’d appreciated it more—or, in fact, that I had chosen printing instead of electronics, which, it turned out, I really wasn’t interested in. Truth is, at the time, my plan was to be a novelist. So printing might have somehow made more sense and gotten me where I wound up a lot sooner.\n\n"

Mice love the little sections of the job case; they nestle into little nests there and soon the case fills up with mouse shit [can we say “shit” here?].\n\nWe hauled this stuff from California 20 years ago as we ended our long careers as letterpress printers. Why we still have this stuff is beyond me. I suppose it is some emotional tie to our fabulous younger days printing & publishing poetry and much else and rambling around San Francisco with the vibrant community of others the same age doing the same thing [and also hanging with our revered elders]. The garage has to be re-built, and I suppose this will all go to the scrap yard soon. Most of the typoe has mouldered some through wet summers and cold winters. I sure hope that font of Fry’s Ornamented I bought from Stephenson Blake about 17 years ago is not out there. I have not seen it in years, though. Why did I buy it?\n\nThere’s nothing special to me about metal type. I’m a typographer because I’m interested in the way type looks on the page, not in how it got there. Letterpress is different than offset, not better. Metal type to me is no more real than the type I am setting right now and that you may soon read on your screen. Offset is so darn good today, and so many text types are so well made: we are in a golden age of typography.\n\nBut as I look to the possibility of retiring from daily work in a few years, I think about getting a platen press and a Ludlow machine and doing some letterpress again. But I hope I never print letterpress from computer-generated type. To me the craft connection of setting type, locking it up, making ready the press, printing the sheets, and then distributing the type is the very essence of the work. I am happy to say I have developed a very different, but very strong level of craft connection as I work at a computer.\n\npowers\n\n"

The computer isn’t just for speed and convenience. It offers far more flexibility and options. . . far more than were possible with metal type. It’s just that most folks won’t take the time, and hand setting metal type forces you to do just that. That craft practice is actually transferable.

Operating costs drop dramatically and one can actually achieve the same results if not remarkably better; and actually make a living at it instead of being constantly in debt.\n\nNew metal type was, and is, quite, quite, more expensive than digital type and when you are sick of it you can’t just delete it or ignore it, it is there, in a cabinet taking up six-square feet of room space, that you are paying rent on.\n\nGerald\n\n"

In fact, it was still quite hot to the touch when it came into my hands. It still has the wedge-shaped metal chunk corresponding to the funnel-tube through which the molten typemetal was poured.\n\nI love it. It’s getting kind of beat up now, though, and the printing face is black from felt-tip marker from my “proofing” experiments.\n\n"

Approx. 30 empty cabinets, 12 tons of lead letters, several wood letter fonts. All together 378 articles at the moment :-)\n\n[http://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front\\_content.php?idcat=36](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010826/http:/www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=36 \"http://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front\\_content.php?idcat=36\")\n\nNow the announcement:  \nStarting next Sunday on 9th of December at 8:30 pm (german time), I’ll offer 37 full character sets of lead letters like the following ones on Ebay Germany:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010826im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/1_6500.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010826im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/2_5180.jpg)\n\nAll auctions will end after one week on Sunday, 16th of December, at 8:30 pa (german time).\n\nThe reason for my announcement.  \nI am a dealer for german lead letter articles.  \nAnd I need money.  \nBut(!): In this case the incoming money is not for me. Every Cent will be paid to an organisation for parents of cancer children in Duesseldorf/Germany:  \n [http://www.kinderkrebsklinik.de/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010826/http:/www.kinderkrebsklinik.de/ \"http://www.kinderkrebsklinik.de/\")\n\nWhy I do this?  \nWell, life is taking and giving. I took, and now its time to give. I organize these kind of auctions since three years in December, after I got into close contact to these parents. I cannot explain it in english, sorry. But I have to do it. I see it as a duty.\n\nNow the rules:  \nWho’s interested to place a bid (auctions will start at Euro 9.90) should send me his/her Ebay name, so I can allow him/her to place bids. And he/she should take care to have an access to my Ebay account at Ebay Germany:  \n [http://search.ebay.de/\\_W0QQfgtpZ1QQfrppZ200QQsassZbleisetzer](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010826/http:/search.ebay.de/_W0QQfgtpZ1QQfrppZ200QQsassZbleisetzer \"http://search.ebay.de/\\_W0QQfgtpZ1QQfrppZ200QQsassZbleisetzer\")\n\nMh? If this posting is a commercial ad?  \nNo, its just a social engagement, a charity project, alright?\n\nBy the way... my opinion is, that every professional working in the pre-press industry should own some lead letters. How will you know where you go if you do not know where you are coming from?\n\nGeorg\n\n"
