Currently, our Adobe Garamond looks blobby to me if it gets too large\n\nSo far, I've come across 2 faces that generally have the feel I'm looking for : Mercury and Requiem both by HoeflerF-J [http://www.typography.com/catalog/mercurydisplay/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173038/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/mercurydisplay/index.html \"http://www.typography.com/catalog/mercurydisplay/index.html\") [http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/roman.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173038/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/roman.html \"http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/roman.html\")\n\nRequiem might be a little too fine to surprint pictures.  \nI'd like to avoid a didot type of approach--it's too stiff; needs more personality\n\nThis display face would most likely be partnered with the sans serif Gotham (now, I really sound like a broken record--hell, I should get a commission!) by HoeflerF-J: [http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173038/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html \"http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html\")\n\nI'm project I'm working on is a magazine redesign for an ultra-affluent market demographic dealing with boats. So, I'll be surprinting water and sky pretty often.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 5.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173038/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%205_2.jpg) | 99.96 KB |\n\n",

See [this helpful Typophile thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173038/http:/typophile.com/node/4782) on the difference between B and H - the only difference I can see is tracking, but that's just the low-res preview.\n\nITC Galliard is in the extended family of Garamond, but crisper. It feels a little cold to me, though, even though that might work ok with the Gotham.\n\nA large optical scale of Centaur might also fit the bill, but it hasn't been released yet. Another classic that might work is [Perpetua](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173038/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/HiddenGems/Perpetua.htm).\n\nOne new font by a living designer that deserves more attention is Cycles by [Sumner Stone](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126173038/http:/www.stonetypefoundry.com/).\n\n"
