  "content": "Hello all,  \nI would like to ask you guys for your help. I am looking to gather an A-Z of the most beatiful 'fat' faces out there. I'm not interested in subtly. I want letters that really stand out from the crowd as individuals as well as a set. Don't wory about placing abstract faces either, anything goes really lets have a bit of fun :)\n\nI have added a lovely 'L' very decorative, to get the lkist going.\n\nIf someone has posted an 'L' (like me) your not allowed to post that letter again. I'm keen to end up with A-Z lets see if we can make it :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021023721im_/http:/typophile.com/files/L_4999.gif)\n\n",
