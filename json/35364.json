You also have the added bonus of Phil Baines and Catherine Dixon as tutors there. I recall a few years ago when LCC was LCP they were getting rid of a lot of letterpress, not sure where it went.\n\nIf you wanted to learn letterpress at BA, you would have to probably take it up as a personal endeavour. A friend of mine did a lot of it on her BA at CSM, regardless of this, you'll have to also study every other area of the graphic arts like every other BA.\n\nPerhaps take a look outside of London. I know that The Cambridge School of Arts have letterpress.\n\nYou will probably find presses all over, but your best bet, and probably your best resource is London.\n\n"
