  "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI’m just starting up a business card for a local Machine Shop. They are pretty small and just getting started.\n\nI’ve looked through a few fonts and have some ideas on where I want to go, but I want to hear what you guys (and gals) have to say.\n\nThe only feedback I got from them so far is that they like Script fonts because of the way they flow. :)\n\nSo any feedback/suggestions/ideas would be awesome - just curious to see what everyone else has for ideas.\n\nThanks,  \nMike\n\n [‹ Font that asserts confidence and sporty too](http://web.archive.org/web/20080928123242/http:/typophile.com/node/35412 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Research Magazine Redesign: serif suggestions to join Bliss? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080928123242/http:/typophile.com/node/35548 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
