Calder, University of Texas Press, Austin, © 1984.\n\nIdentifont says the font is Elmhurst, but I don’t think that’s quite right. I’d also appreciate suggestions of fonts which are close.\n\nThanks,\n\nWangden\n\nP.S. Sorry about the distortion created by the lens of my digital camera. I don’t have a scanner.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Calder\\_sample.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=Calder_sample.jpg) | 221.93 KB |\n\n",
