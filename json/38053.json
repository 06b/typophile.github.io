I am guessing the EFCEOP version has central euro figures, but I haven’t a clue what the EFTUOP family variant could be.\n\nAre they all exclusive character sets, or is there one of these that contains all of the others? I expect that by buying the EFOP version I’ll be wasting my money?\n\nAny help/advise much appreciated.\n\nSteve\n\n [‹ Roman fonts on Chinese packaging](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013100750/http:/typophile.com/node/38061 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The Mystery of Steile Futura (Topic) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013100750/http:/typophile.com/node/18227 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In the Elsner+Flake<br>\nDigital Library, it is distinguished between different layouts.<br>\n1. Text layout with tabular figures<br>\n2. Text layout (OsF) with old style figures instead of tabular figures<br>\n3. Text layout (SC) with small caps instead of lower case characters and<br>\nold style figures instead of tabular figures<br>\n4. Headline layout<br>\n5. Display layout<br>\n6. Text layout Central European (CE) with tabular figures<br>\n7. Text layout Turkish (T) with tabular figures</cite>\n\nThe combined abbrevations on MyFonts aren’t covered by that 1:1, but my guess is:  \nCE is Central European, TU is Turkish. OP is for OpenType.\n\nF\n\n"
