  "content": "Hello, hi\n\nThe magazine's name is \"SALDO\" which means something like \"bank balance\" in Swedish (it's for the business students). Basically it containt useful info for students, interviews (sometimes with bigshots like the Swedish finance minister!) and other stuff that's relevant for a business student.\n\nCurrent logo is in Arial Black which has an added shadow and wider than usual letters.\n\nI've drawn some own letters that are meant to look like Arial/Helvetica but much more simple in their form. However I'm having a hard time with the letter 'S'.\n\nEven though it's starting to not look like complete crap it doesn't seem to fit with the other letters at all.\n\nI'd be happy with all help I can get.\n\nThe final logo will have the smaller text and line underneath it. Oh, and don't be shy to criticize the other letters and whole design.\n\nOld (current) logo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516135533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/saldo_logo_old_4511.jpg)\n\nNew (work in progress) logo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516135533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/saldo_logo_new_01_6064.jpg)\n\n",

If it's too boring try manipulating the text itself to make it more unique.\n\nI do like that you scaled it down in size though.\n\nMagazines that are cluttered aren't magazines that are read.
