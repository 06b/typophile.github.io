In Chrome, IE or Opera the fonts look fine, though (using win7). I have done a fresh install of FF in a virtual machine but the font display is still bad. I would like to ask the forum if if you too see these differences?\n\nI attach two images for Chrome and Firefox to illustrate the difference in rendering.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Chrome](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308045643/http:/typophile.com/files/c_10.jpg) | 339.41 KB |\n| [Firefox](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308045643/http:/typophile.com/files/f_9.jpg) | 411.97 KB |\n\n",
