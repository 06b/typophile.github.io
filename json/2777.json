In addition to Ignacio's suggestions Letterhead fonts has two fonts that come with a variety of underlining swashes:   \n [Pilsner and Ephemera](http://web.archive.org/web/20141106221125/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/styles/script.shtml). With the right graphics tools you could make some pretty fancy lettering with those.\n\n"
