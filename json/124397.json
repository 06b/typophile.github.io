      "content": "I hate to rain on your parade but here's my feedback.\n\nI think the \"turning letters into a lamp\" thing is cute. But it's not what Laura Ashley would do. It's too contrived, too gimmicky. They are a mature, traditional, classic design company. Look at their existing branding; it's elegant, simply, almost minimalist, with the focus being on the products.\n\nIf \"LAHI\" is in fact an acronym that they have identified as one that they would use, then I would look for a more classic, understated treatment and leave the \"look at me I'm a clever visual trope\" look behind. It just doesn't work with their brand, in my opinion.\n\nThis might work for some cheeky home decor startup, but I don't see it fitting with the Laura Ashley brand at all.\n\nAlso the whole trefoil stuff around the mark is gratuitous. It's ornament that does not do anything other than distract. You're trying to make it look elegant but that's because the logotype and the LAHI part is not strong enough, visually, to carry it off. It ends up just being busy fluff.\n\nAnd if I were going to go with it, I would lose the pull chain and find another way of signaling that the \"A\" is the shade of a lamp (which is forced to begin with as you have to turn into a \"not-a\". Like making bright marks or something.\n\n"
