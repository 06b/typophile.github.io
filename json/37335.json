Do we need to vote on whether this bug should be fixed?\n\nIf I missed prior discussion on this topic, please point me to the thread.\n\n [‹ Fat fonts wanted.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080420111510/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37269 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New York Times-ish fonts wanted ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080420111510/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37358 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
