Many people do, but strictly speaking, Sütterlin is but one variant of this type of script, basically a less-elegant, monoline upright version that was used in schoolbooks (see [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20100212132846/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCtterlin)).\n\nWe've had a bunch of Kurrent stuff recently (which is a good thing – I'm always surprised that it is so little known internationally). There was this wonderful [handwritten cookbook](http://web.archive.org/web/20100212132846/http:/typophile.com/node/65337) that Hanno posted to Typophile; my Flickr page has [a few spreads from an old Swiss schoolbook featuring both Fraktur & Kurrentschrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20100212132846/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/sets/72157622929372055/) (not Sütterlin), and [a sign painter's version of the Kurrent alphabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20100212132846/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/4184236243/) from a 1930s lettering manual.
