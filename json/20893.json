Carol Twombly's Caslon Pro (Adobe) looks good and is versatile, but it doesn't really sing on the page like Augereau would (as Garamonds go), or perhaps FF Scala or Eureka, if we're talking slab serifs.\n\nPerhaps my inexperience has gotten the better of me and I can't appreciate Caslon for what it is. I don't mind spending money on something nice, lord knows I've already spent a small fortune on fonts, but I like beautiful things that are made by dedicated designers. I'm looking for a Caslon that is thick, robust, has a full set of ligatures and obviously, osf/sc faces.\n\n",

Being a spectator (and user) suits me just fine, but I'm playing with the idea of designing some day, although I have no formal training in the craft. Perhaps my eye for the aesthetic might serve me well in that regard. The last thng I want, however, is to insult the craft by being a dilletante among masters who have had actual training. The master-apprentice relationship might be dying, but I'd like to think it still thrives in some areas. Hopefully it still does in the realm of typeface design.\n\n"

      "content": "Palatine, TypeCon is definitely not only for master type designers. Most people there are graphic designers who love type, not type designers. And most events will be of great interest to graphic designers, judging by last year.\n\nAs to the master-apprentice question, if I remember rightly, I heard Matthew Carter say that all type designers have been largely self-taught, from the 15th century till now. This may be changing with the programs at Reading and KABK, though my impression is that these are a way for people to develop themselves who have already educated themselves quite a bit in type design, or the related subjects they are studying.\n\nIn any case I would highly recommend TypeCon to you, given what you say is the state of your interest.You will meet and be able to talk with some of the best designers in the world there, and start to see if it is for you or not. I was delighted to find last year how accessible and helpful people were. Also the workshops will help you to start on the technical side, if you want.\n\n"

I'm also a stickler for ligatures. I also don't tend to use small caps unless they are native to the font (i.e. not from the Quark menu) but with the various types of heads I need for cookbooks they can be very useful. I've used Adobe Caslon (and Garamond) for a lot of cookbooks. Thesis fonts and some of the Fontfont like Meta have good fraction sets too.\n\nThe swashes and ornaments less so, but I did use swash characters from Adobe Caslon on my web site [http://www.patriciafabricant.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320043527/http:/www.patriciafabricant.com/ \"http://www.patriciafabricant.com\").\n\n"

It's kind of like switching back and forth btw Quark and Indy.\n\nTotally off topic, I worked once with an editor whose last name was ffolliott - all lower case. Literally begins with a ligature.

Even legal reports are given a bit of typographic loving. I've talked a few of my law profs into accepting work that is typeset in something other than Times, for instance, and spaced in a manner conducive to reading comfort. They've taken quite well to the whole scheme.\n\nbrampitoyo:\n\nITC Caslon 224 is part of my Adobe OpenType Collection, actually. The lower case \"f\" isn't to my liking. It looks like it doesn't belong, much like the infamous lower case \"c\" in Rotis, if Im not mistaken. The captial \"Q\" however, is a nice touch - a classic Caslonesque style.
