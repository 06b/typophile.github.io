Saw it in print when walking past LACMA and although it reminds me of a humanist Futura a little bit, I haven't been able to figure out what it is exactly..but it's beautiful and bold!  \nThanks in advance\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n FUTURA PT HEAVY \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [donshottype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317094923/http:/typophile.com/user/205259 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

See how visual perception is a trickster.  \nDear reader, you don't have to believe me. You can duplicate these results using a screen grab of the original image, which is larger scale than shown here, and edit to reverse colors.  \nDon\n\n"
