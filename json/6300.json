  "content": "I just got a copy of the newest edition of _Spatium,_ a German magazine on typography produced by the Typosition Studio in Offenbach. The star article in the issue is by Hrant, on the Latinization of Non-Latin scripts and typefaces   \n   \nSnipits about Spatium and Hrant's article have been heard on typophile before, but I think that it is now time for everyone to place their orders for the magazine, as it has finally arrived (it was presented publicly for the first time today, in Offenbach, of course). This issue, unlike the previous three, is printed in both German and English.   \n   \nSpatium Magazine   \n [http://www.spatium-newsletter.de/index.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052815/http:/www.spatium-newsletter.de/index.php)   \n   \nTyposition   \n [http://www.typosition.de/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052815/http:/www.typosition.de/)   \n   \n   \n(There is also a tiny contribution on page 49 from TypeOff., the HfG Offenbach's Type Design Collective.

These are really chic, especially the \"girly\" shirts.   \n   \nIf you just want a copy of the magazine, type a 1 under the \"Anzahl\" slot to the left of \"Magazine Gruppe 11\" (under the red \"Bestellen\"). \"Anzahl\" means \"number,\" so don't type 2 unless you want two copies�   \n   \nThen type in your mailing address. \"Stra�e/Nr:\" means \"Street and House Number.\" The Germans type things in that order (Geisbergstra�e 3), but you can ignore their silly conventions and type in you address the good old american way, as I've done here. \"PLZ/Ort\" means \"Zip Code and Place.\" \"Land\" means \"Country.\"   \n   \nClicking the \"Artikel bestellen\" button (which means \"order item\") will lead to some other magical page, I imagine� I've never ordered anything online from Spatium before, so I don't know what happens next, but it is probably self expanatory. If you get sad because this form is just too confusing, you can e-mail Peter directly by clicking on the \"Kontakt\" (which means \"contact\") button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.\n\n"
