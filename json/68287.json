  "content": "I am currently doing a logo for Italian restaurant, pizzeria and spaghetteria. Name for restaurant is Bruschetta, located in Zadar, Croatia.\n\nClient even before brief wanted Kunstler script to use as main typography but I think it is not so appropriate for an Italian restaurant.  \nI need alternative for script if client doesn't want to use serifed typeface.\n\nSo I am looking for a script that has organic feel, that has connection with food, vegetables, ingredients. And also convey italian and mediterranean feel.\n\nThought of pairing Bodoni and Bodoni script but I am not sure for now.\n\nAnd maybe something like this.\n\nThanks everyone.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140409110122im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo_Dine_Italia_2009_4044.jpg)\n\n",
