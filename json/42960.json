      "content": "As another aspiring type designer, I can say for certain one thing I've figured out: there's no magic formula to creating a great typeface, and everyone has their own method. Of course, the one I use, and which I think is quite typical, is to draw out the UC and lc of \"hamburgefonstiv\" (there are lots of similar words, like \"handgloves\"), to define all the basic rules of the typeface. I scan these in, trace them in FontLab, and then work entirely digitally from there. Translating the essence of your sketch to bezier curves is probably the hardest thing to do as a type designer, at least in my opinion.\n\nIf I could be a fly on the wall and copy Jonathon Hoefler's or Matthew Carter's working process, I'm not sure it would improve my type design skills at all. Unfortunately, the only way to design an amazing typeface is to design a bunch of crappy ones and figure out what doesn't work. I have been happy with the concepts of all my typefaces, but I don't think I've made one yet that succeeds aesthetically -- each new one does get better, though.\n\n"

Producing a font is a construction process; I draw each glyph in detail in Fontlab with its excellent drawing tools and sometimes with a tablet for spontenaity. For most fonts I don't do any sketching on paper. I visualize what I am going to draw in my mind.\n\nUnless you are making a script or handwriting font, scanning drawings on paper---no matter how neat you manage to make the drawings---is a cumbersome and unneccessary way to transfer material from paper to Fontlab. Scanning a sketch then cleaning up the bitmap and importing it into Fontlab, then drawing over the top of the bitmap used as a mask, and perfecting the vector drawing---all that is a time-consuming hassle. I find it easier to tape the sketch to the shadow mask of the monitor and simply reproduce digitally what I see in the glyph window, drawing it by eye. That method has improved my bezier drawing skills lots.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Ed did the drawings and I did all the digitizing. Ed had such a dismissive attitude towards the computer tools. He said he felt he could do a better job drawing by hand and try as I did, I could not get him to try working with bezier tools. I had to laugh, since the way Ed had worked for years was the analog equivalent of the same technique. Ed would draw basic shapes and have them shot onto film. He would then cut the film up and strip the elements together. Have another film shot and retouch the results. This shooting of film positives and film negatives went on until he was happy with the results.\n\nSame technique, different tools.\n\n"

(Mind that answers in this direction came from experienced type designers!)  \nIf you are still new to type design, then you better take _a lot of_ time, sit down at your desk with pens and pencils, and write and draw so you get a feeling for letterforms. And then scan, trace, and refine the outlines. You will notice that switching the medium in this process will raise questions you would not have encountered otherwise. (Things like: Corners seem to be rounded after scanning the drawings -- do I keep them rounded, or do I transform them into corners? I need to make a decision. This is very different from doing corners right from the start and never thinking about an alternative.)

I would not let the cap M change the whole font. If you've got a good design idea, and OoHn right in accord with the idea, and interactively adjust those with aeg, and all is still good, then you've basically got a good font design. The diagonal letters are challenging, but they've been solved a lot of ways in the past, and its just up to you to make them work, given the rest of the font.\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't interactively massage everything as you go on, but as far as setting the look of the font the 'control letters' are generally the approach of experienced designers. For example, Erik Spiekermann basically drew only these for Meta Serif, and then asked Christian Schwartz to do the rest. Schwartz and Kris Sowersby did the rest, but just those few letters (which admittedly he took years to figure out, and finally only in discussion with Schwartz) are still maybe 50% of the new design ideas, though a small fraction of the many, many hours of work.\n\n"

I think you first have to figure out what your intention is for the typeface. If it is a text face, the lowercase will probably dominate your decisions. You also have to work out the text density and efficiency ratio desired so you can determine x-height to cap height ratio. Testing problem children like double-bowl g and a with o and n to figure out weight can be enlightening learning experience. I am not saying this is a suggested way to approach a design, I am just saying I have started several typefaces in different ways and learned different things each time. My reasoning is not to find the most efficient way straight off but to learn as much as I can about the design process by doing lots of \"what if\" scenarios.

There might be a big scanning/autotrace session in there too. For other more modular or mechanical designs there might be very little drawing and considerably more cutting and pasting. Many designs can't really be resolved without extensive proofing, now best done in the digitized state. So drawings might just be sketches that get digitized immediately.\n\nKey characters do help you get the \"DNA\" as Matthew Carter has said in the Helvetica film. HOnh to start with for contrast and other basic things like bowl shape, serif length, x-height to cap ratio, etc. Then the letters that combine those: Db. Get the spacing of all these right and you're on your way. Add other letters that give more character and style info like ABEGRSabegv. Many of us have rushed to finish the whole alphabets, then the figures, then the italic, then then then, only to look at the original efforts months later and realize it was all garbage and has to be re-done from scratch. This is \"measure twice, cut once\", applied to type design.\n\nJames, I'm not sure how much it will help you to know the answer to this; everyone works a different way, and it's really the results that matter. There are terrible designs with hundreds of hours of fussy handcrafting, and wonderful designs that are almost just autotraced sketches. Each designer might use a dozen different techniques. If your technique shows, or you aren't in control of the tools, that will weaken the design. This is why some people stick to certain methods. But as you can see, there is a huge range of strategies, from telling someone else what you want, all the way to carefully hand-drawing every character at 500 point and specifying digitization points. Some people don't even do digital outline work themselves; they draw and have others digitize. Again, it's the results that matter.\n\nCaveat: I think a weak and flawed strategy is taking someone else's finished outlines and trying to modify them enough to call it original. Very few designers are capable of this; too often the telltale essential structure remains. For that matter, how many skilled designers would take this route, knowing the limited benefit it will bring? I don't necessarily make the same decisions about point placement or anything else that another designer would, so I find this a useless method. It's somewhere between \"homage\" and \"knockoff\".\n\n"

But the face was not an adaptation, so I had more claim on authorship.  \nI would be interested in your opinion.\n\nCarl, well put, I'm with you most of the way on that.\n\nOne thing I do note is that design themes in different typefaces may be best represented (or thorniest) in different groups of characters, so those are the characters you want to refine the theme on first. So for one face, much might depend on the way _r_ and _a_ fit together, whereas for another with interesting curves, it wouldn't be a good idea to leave binocular _g_ till the end.

Combine that with the different methods and backgrounds of type designers and you have potentially unlimited new challenges, no matter how much experience you have. Every design I work on has something new to show me. And if I'm extending the character set of another designer's work, my decisions are influenced by that. So many variables!\n\n"

I can quickly sketch out ideas, and then draw a more tidy version of it to scan and trace. I guess I could start directly with vectors, but it doesn't really work for me, because I can draw curves more naturally by hand.\n\nSo for me drawing it first is faster, more spontaneous, but I also just _like_ drawing type! :)\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Jelma!\n\nI do not quite agree with the thing you said about spontaneity. I think the truth lies on the contrary.  \nAt least in my eyes. I can do the basics of a new design idea throughout an our or two (although it depends  \nmuch on how inspiration is flowing) and then I work it over on monitor.  \nThe problem with the Beziérs (I believe) is that they really do not work good with analog form, i.e. interpreting  \nit. So, too much painstaking work has to be done in that process and in the end it always weakens type in its  \nidea and forms somehow - makes it become/look digital.  \nSo I abbandoned (wrong spelling sorry;-) designing by hand completely although I love it definitely.  \nI think we have 2 different worlds here colliding.  \nFor me designing on monitor has become something comparable to “engraving“.  \nSounds funny but it is like directly forming type in the “metal”/material for which it is purposed in the end.  \n(though not monitor but beziérs) I try to cancel the step from analog to digital in my work.  \nThough I sometimes envy you guys ;-)))\n\nSalute  \nStefan\n\n"

It feels right. The only difference is that it is too hard to erase a mistake in an engraving, there is no \"undo\" command :-)\n\nChrisL\n\n"

That's because Bezier curves tends to push you in certain directions, which are yours to use or contradict. Bezier curves are the medium you're working in. I can understand that in a script face, the hand \\*written\\* original might be much more important.\n\n"
