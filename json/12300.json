Roma as his favorite soccer team. He, wife Catharina, son Victor and daughter Sarah live in a sunny flat in downtown Stockholm.\n\nStefan's work is released under his [MAC Rhino](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043531/http:/typophile.com/wiki/MAC%20Rhino) label.\n\n**External Links**  \n [MAC Rhino](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043531/http:/www.macrhino.com/)  \n [MAC Rhino Type Specimens](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043531/http:/stewf.com/work/hattenbach/)\n\n",
