I’m looking for a critique on the readability, how easily the shapes are recognized as hills and the relevance to the target audience.\n\nThe target audience is (this is taken from the associations design brief):\n\nA. Baby boomers and retirees, ages 45-75+, Interested in the outdoors, gathering places, diversity, art & culture, and education.  \nB. Upwardly mobile, professional / creative class with disposable income, ages 30-45\n\nThanks for your input.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ff02.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215532/http:/typophile.com/files/ff02.gif) | 3.01 KB |\n\n",

I agree with Dan about making “Find” smaller and strengthening the “F“‘s crossbars.\n\nAdditiionally, you have a pefect opportunity for an “fi” ligature in “Find” and the “dF” connector looks contrived/unatural and detracts from the hill metaphor. I would lose that all together and finish the “d” closer to the baseline.\n\nKeep it coming this has great potential.\n\n"
