  "content": "I read in this months Grafik about Builds' album cover for Flying Lotus in collaboration with Commonwealth and Timothy Saccenti. It explained the various methods of constructing the images used but what I found intriguing was the explanation of where the type came from. It says the type was custom drawn by Mr Place from an old letraset catalogue. It goes on to say that the typeface was Pinball.\n\nI'm curious to find out more about old letraset and its uses today. Anybody know where I could get my hands on some of these?\n\n",

      "content": "Hi smongey,\n\nWhen \"graphic designers\" were using Letraset for design, scientists were using it to make charts and graphs &c. I know this because I am currently doing an interdisciplinary masters degree in typography and cognitive psychology. If there is a school with a science department close to where you live, just go there and ask to speak to old teachers/department heads. Start with the department receptionist, smile, ask her your honest story and if she could recommend which faculty memember she thinks would be most likely to have some old catalogues. Many will be pack-rats. You may find that some have not only catalogues, but hoards of Letraset as well. They will be far more likely to give it up as they aren't nostalgic about it the way we are. I scored two catalogues the other day from my supervisor.\n\n"
