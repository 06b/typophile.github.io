Why not try and leave the 'a' as seperate and cut the 'm'? (so the leftmost stem seems to come from the 'a'. draw a thick white stroke down the left side of the 'a')   \nI'd show you, but im at work with no image editor ![:(](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011200637im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)   \n   \nYou get the idea?   \n   \nBren\n\n"

But its true.   \n   \nJust one suggestion as well...after really looking at some of the characters - I wonder if the \"u\", the \"r\" and the \"e\" need just a bit of work on some of the curves. I'm noticing a bit of straightness or something - can't find the technical word for it but see the lower left inside of the \"e\".   \n   \nAlso - I prefer the word \"dura\" to be full strength over the other word - since it is your name...\n\n"

      "content": "Like Ben said, 'dura' should be full strength. I think that because the face is so geometric you will not be able to manipulate the logo much more.   \nOne thing you might consider is the 10% grey outline, either darken it or take it out. Light greys like that often dont copy well.   \n   \nTo give the logo more substance you might try a bolder weight? that way at a smaller size it will read well. Have you also tried inverting the colour? (white on black) I often find it helpful to test for eventualities.   \n   \nThat 'e' does need a redraw ;)   \n   \nBren\n\n"
