  "content": "This is a first rough attemt to form the logotype for \"Compania Danza Flamenca\", an neaerly newstarted flamencodancing-crew with base in Stockholm.   \n   \n If we skip the details in both the illustrative part and the roughly sketched typeface for a while, I want some comments on the composition i general, and some feedback about the fact that I let the text be involved in her dress like that.   \n   \n ![Compania Danza Flamenca-logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023061537im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47822.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Hello Per   \n   \nBeyond the details (as you said) i think the main problem is the size of the title comparing to the whole image.   \n   \nI suggest that you may not keep the real analogies and exaggerate with the size of dress. Making bigger the dress will make the title clearer, it will add motion in the design and also exaggeration fits well with the mediterranean concept.   \n   \nHope i was helpfull.   \n   \nchristos\n\n"

      "content": "You have a great concept, Per. It just needs more work. I would concentrate on simplifying the illustration and then work in the type. It need not be spelled out completely in the dress. One can't determine that without exploring lots of possibilities. I like it even if you do no more than this.   \n   \nPG   \n   \n [http://giam.typepad.com/the\\_branding\\_of\\_polaroid\\_/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023061537/http:/giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/)\n\n"
