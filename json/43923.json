For single weights, have a look at this [overview at MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907050901/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/familytree.html); there is quite a number of versions available.  \nF\n\n"

I never knew about it until now, so maybe it should be mentioned more visibly, like on the Adobe fonts home page. Freelancers turning to graphic design without benefit of art school (and there are many of us) can then buy it for themselves instead of stealing shareware fonts.\n\n"

It will be much more useful for graphic arts courses than the old package, which seemed to be filled with display faces.
