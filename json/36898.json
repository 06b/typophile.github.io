It's based on a song called Metaphor by Sparks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416142016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Metaphortest1_4383.jpg)\n\nSo it's pretty wonky and some characters need to be re-done totally I think - like the x and r. But I'd love some opinions.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

I like 'e', it says \"Yo, my cred is streety.\" 't' and 'h' are nice, but at the resolution I'm looking at something feels slightly incongruent between them. I think its my screen.\n\nUpdate where this leads.\n\n"
