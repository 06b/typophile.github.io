  "content": "for a display typeface with OT alternates i’m looking for a way to best make the following stroke patterns. this is of course a not so perfect example, exporting to illustrator and using pathfinder and re-exporting to fontlab obviously leads to points being moved to fit onto the 1000pt grid.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103114215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bild-14-1_5896.gif)\n\naction/gradient is the nearest effect i could find and i guess i would need a python script to really make this work, but have no idea where to start. is there anyone that by chance already has such a script and would like to share it, or something similar? :)\n\nthanks for any help!\n\n",
