  "content": "Well I cant get mad, but im very disappointed. . . CS2 SUCKS on the intel based Macs. I work from a dependable g5 desktop and just purchased a new macbook pro laptop. Aside from transferring my activation back and forth every morning before I go to work, CS2 is perhaps the most unstable program I have ever used when running on the Macbook pro. Illustrator crashes every 20 minutes or so, and dont every try to use the pathfinder toolbar. . . bad juju. InDesign crashes on certain saves, and when page counts exceed 50 or so.\n\nI cant live with out these programs, as im sure many of you others out there cant. I would expect a little more support from Adobe for these issues. Some sort of a fix seems almost necessary.\n\nAnyone else having as much trouble as I am?\n\nIs Rosetta a program running behind the scenes on the Macbook Pros that allows the older programs to be compatible (barely) with the newer OS.\n\nAdobe claims CS3 will be ready in Spring and that Leopard could also be a fix. But I have no idea on that release date.\n\nAnyone who can console me would be my hero ;)\n\nCheers\n\n [‹ Typesetting Mac and Mc](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207122518/http:/typophile.com/node/30647 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Times for new 'experts'... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207122518/http:/typophile.com/node/30621 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

As an owner of 2 intel Macs, and a heavy user for some time of Adobe programs, it makes me cry every time I see Illustrator CS2 crash because I decided to use the pathfinder. Any program is highly unstable, and when you have a big job / file, it will simply freeze or crash. Even if you aren’t doing anything, just letting Photoshop CS2 sit idle, it will crash, sooner or later. It’s abysmal.\n\nI am in love with the CS3 beta, but I really, —really— hope they speed the release of the complete Creative Suite 3, which is slated for Spring this year.\n\n"

It’s easy to blame the third party developers because it seems to be their applications that are causing the problems, when really a lot of blame can go to Apple. Although I’m a Mac user, Apple seems to move too quickly without giving their developers enough time to catch up with their changes. The same sort of thing happened when they introduced OS X a few years back. If the keep doing it, it’ll bite them in the a$$ eventually.\n\nSpeaking of the Wii, Nintendo had a similar problem back in the day when they decided to stick with a cartridge based system instead of compact discs. They lost a lot of their 3rd party developers and went from number one, to now trying to catch up to Sony and Microsoft for market share. A hardware change is a big deal to developers. Apple needs to start paying attention to this because people using Adobe products is major factor driving Mac purchases.\n\n"

      "content": "The crashyness of the programs I use has varied over the years.  \nSince OS X, I have generally had fewer crashes and freezes, and the beautiful thing is it’s just the program that crashes, not the entire computer. And the program reboots real quick.  \nSo sure, you might lose some work if you haven’t been saving (but many programs have auto backup facility). If you know the prog is a bit dodgy, you will be careful with saves.\n\nThe worst ever was the version of Quark that crashed when you moved the cursor a little above the menu bar. I had huge horror stories with the introduction of both System 7 and the Power Macs. Getting used to OS X wasn’t easy, but it had so many new features which made up for the problems. Apple going Intel has beeen relatively smooth, for me.\n\nI’m running CS on an Intel Mac, and it’s slower than on the G4 I was using, but streaming content on the Internet is brilliant. I knew CS would be slower, but it was time for a new computer.\n\nYou can’t expect Adobe and Apple to sync their product releases, so I don’t think there is any blame here. And the upgrades come fairly frequently, so just sit tight for CS3 which will be Intel-native, ennit?\n\nI hope that was some consolation James.\n\n"

We’ve added intel iMacs, Macbook Pro’s, and most recently, a few Mac Pro’s. The major kicker with CS2 really seems to be RAM. With the first round of laptops and imacs, we didn’t max the RAM out, and can’t run illustrator and photoshop both without one crashing the other. Today is my 3rd day of working on a new Mac Pro Quad 2.66, upgraded to 4GB RAM. It’s a compltetely different story. Some things seem to be even faster than my dual 2.0 G5 2 GB RAM. The iMac is much better off with a RAM upgrade as well. It also seems like rosetta (no matter the mac) runs best if it’s been restarted from time to time. The PS CS3 beta has been too buggy for me to continue with, and i’m happy so far with CS2 under rosetta. If you’re stuck working with an intel mac at this point...shove as much RAM as you can in the thing and plug away until “second quarter 2007”.\n\n"

It’s especially important with Rosetta; she’s a big fat cow of an app and tends to graze her way through pastures of free RAM, leaving massive heaps of crap in her wake.\n\n"
