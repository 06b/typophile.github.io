This ideal only makes sense when the author is not also the type designer. When an author is making type for his own writing he is free to make the type fit verbal style more closely than would otherwise be possible. Should he, then, add to the ordinary typographic marker for stress - the clearly differentiated italic - one or more fonts much closer to the ordinary roman, so close, in fact, that their perception as different would to the common reader be merely subliminal, in order to intensify or direct the reader’s experience of the words?\n\nSome options: modulating horizontal proportions, thus doing more subtly what Shaw and Gill did in letterspacing lowercase for emphasis; switching the architectural forms of some letters (as in aeyg) - too indiscrete because in the mathematical sense too discrete, I think; modulating between historical traditions (ie from Neoclassical to Baroque by changing the predominating axis, or from Humanist to Baroque by changing the degree of variance in axis); and (my initial preference) massaging the subtler “feel” of the alphabet, as if, for instance, moving between [Storm Jannon](http://web.archive.org/stormtype.com/jannon.html) and [Storm Serapion](http://web.archive.org/stormtype.com/serap.html).\n\n [‹ [gallery] T2-Worshop 9. \"Snow Letter\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105837/http:/typophile.com/node/17903 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [indesign question again (sorry) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105837/http:/typophile.com/node/17895 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

There have also been many typographers (many from the Basel arena) who have worked to visualize meaning through structure and juxtaposition in typography. The texts they used were typically not in the “normal use” vein and therefore don’t quite come off as something you can extrapolate data from. This would still be difficult to do because (like measuring the path of a particle in Quantum mechanics) the act of measuring affects the data. In this case, how do you get someone to differentiate between something gained consciously from something gained supposedly totally unconsciously without making it conscious?  \nIt may be that people (other than those involved in typography, design, and readability research) just read words. Changes in font help with organization for the reader in “normal” kinds of stuff (books, newspapers, reports, etc.). Using typographic design (a la Basel, DaDa, et al), can have a communication affect in shorter, more persuasive texts or artistic literature, but it seems most of this would be conscious or at least semiconscious.  \nI guess what I am saying is that the affect you describe is more a part of who the audience is and their visual literacy level (along with the kind of reading—not immersive) than who the author is.

One can read text at different rates, and complex texts on unfamiliar subjects are read with many more fixations, so the bottleneck cannot be absolute, but I agree that the brain seems to like discarding as much as possible. It might be that altering the visual aspect of words would cause more attention to be paid to the visual, with perhaps disastrous rather than benign consequences for the perception of the verbal. I imagine it’s a question of how much two-way feedback there is between the relevant verbal and visual centres at the stages of processing responsible to affective response - and that kind of question is far from being settled in psychology.\n\nTim - you’re right, of course, though these authors have had a while now. But whose prose is sufficiently impressive that work invested in learning to make type would be more valuable than the same work invested in learning to write? Hardly anyone going at the moment: maybe Martin Amis and Don DeLillo, but I read very little contemporary fiction.

These typographic gimmics have no close, immediately experienced relation with felt words, because the words weren’t felt in the first place.\n\nIt’s true that it’d be almost impossible to test the additional effectiveness of the massaged versus the straight text. That’s annoying.\n\nRaph, your idea sounds much better than mine!

I do think that sound (as in pronunciation like Raph spoke of) is perhaps a more likely route for success since our alphabet is phonetic. Don’t throw away your idea though.

Instead of putting the phonetic shaping into alternates I put it up front in the default letter set using a consistent scheme that allows the face to be used without the setter having to make any decisions about which glyph to use based on its sound. The main sticking point is “c”. Rhodaelian’s “c” is half soft, half sharp, to cover soft c sounds and hard c sounds. At least 4 alternates are available for fine tuning every letter.

Its up to the writer and the reader to **decide** how a text reads, how the inflexion varies. And since so many decisions are made by readers, a good deal of ambiguity or “fudge factor” is involved. Besides, the best authors don’t use any kind of visual (typographic) emphasis to modulate their narrator’s voice; they rely on their skill as writers instead. Read Hemingway.

Publishing doesn’t work that way. Economic realities are involved. Like Hollywood film production where the movies that get made have nothing to do with making good films, but are instead dictated by union quotas for employment of production staff, the box office draw-power of stars, and the popular appeal of high-concept storylines fleshed out in cliché-ridden scripts by bad acting.\n\nMarket appeal and popular demand are the main criteria publishers use for which manuscripts they publish. Book publishing does not thrive on high quality literature, but low quality junk that sells in large numbers. Happily that creates the prosperity that allows quality literature to be published on a small scale, to the delight of people like us.\n\nDiscounting the discipline and craft part of font making for a moment; Judging a person’s ability as a writer by their aesthetic prowess in designing a text font is not realistic. The best writers generally aren’t designers. Would you really judge a writer by his ability as a type designer? Or a classical violinist by his ability to make a beautiful-looking, blissful-sounding violin? The guy is a musician, not a carpenter.\n\nBacktracking for a moment;\n\n_...one could tell at a glance which of them had sufficient taste..._\n\nYou and I could, but most of the book-buying public couldn’t. Some printers and typesetters have good grasp of which text fonts are beautiful and practical, and some I’ve met haven’t got a clue and don’t care—-they’re only setting type to earn money, not to be good practitioners of the art. Then there’s publishers, the business boffins at the top of the pile who mostly aren’t aesthetes or fans of type design. Their first love is money.\n\n_...99% of fiction would become blissfully self-cancelling, a great boon to the book-buying public_\n\nThat would wipe out 99% of the publishing industry.\n\n_I don’t take to be more than cousin to that which Nabokov describes_\n\nI’m not quite sure what you mean.\n\nTo clarify, I advocate simplicity of writing technique—-word-smithing—-as the basis or starting point for good writing. I love the simplicity of Hemingway, and equally the complex technical precision of Poe, as well as the deft prose of Philip K. Dick’s mainstream novels, and everything in between, as long as it is artful prose.\n\n_...art at its greatest is fantastically deceitful and complex_\n\nSome of it, yes. Some art is very simple and direct. Nabokov’s statement focuses on the mechanism of great art, **how** it works its magic on the spectator. But what of the effect of art? In my view, art has redeeming qualities. It makes us and the world whole again thru a process of redemption. Literature without that quality is hack work, not art.\n\nGeorge, I’m sorry if my comment, “I think you’re wasting your time.” upset you. It’s only my view, only what “I think”.

The holistic effect of a sense of redemption is, I think, a little more closely defined as the imagination of a common culture, in which what it is right to feel (and thus say and do) in situations analogous to some we experience in reality is not in doubt. Such a common culture cannot exist in a consequentialist and agnostic society, but the vision of it provides real consolation.

The range of focus, and of analytical tools, on these courses is astonishingly narrow, and the pressure to confine one’s interests and opinions to what’s on offer very great. Capitalised Literary Theory in all its common forms relies on one psychology of literary production (somewhere in the artist’s head, power puts on the mask of culture) and three of reception (the reader naively assents to, or bravely deconstucts the coded messages of the Foucauldian paranoid; or he finds signification endlessly postponed, leaving the text a void), none of which is remotely convincing. But these “false certainties” are repeated so often, by people who explicitly deny the uses of both argument and evidence against their positions, that they are often believed; and beliefs have force, here for evil. What possible uses does Derrida have? What single paragraph of his have you found good? I’d love to see it.\n\nArt that needs meta-data is rhetoric not invention, because it relies on high-level, after-the-fact conceptual consideration. Protest art is obviously rhetoric rather than invention. I want arguments laid down with a decent attempt to list premises, explain method and give deductive or inductive arguments; and I want art unburdened with the freight of opinion that will, a few centuries down the line, look hopelessly moth-eaten. Arguments are arguable, so probably (let’s face it) wrong; and error, for me, is both foreign and corrosive to artistic invention. To avoid opinionising altogether - to achieve impersonality - is hard but doable; the trick was pulled off by Shakespeare, who eliminated the narrator’s voice and ensured that all opinions expressed were contradicted elsewhere.\n\n"

But the notion of a full signification is philosophically suspect, as the notion of a final signification is not. For what is a partial signification? There is only signification tout court as a mental event - a change of qualities in the substance of mind. As for final signification, the idea that mind is not static is no great revelation.  \n<cite>I am not all that familiar with how Foucault has been applied in Lterary Theory</cite>  \nIf you knew what had been done in his name... But Foucault was certainly unreliable in the extreme as a historian of science. His writing on medieval matters, specifically its treatment of madness, is at the level of a Ruskin or a Morris in its disregard for data, and the Laingian view of the madman as a corrupt world’s last innocent, which underlies Foucault’s stuff, has led to innumerable failures to treat schizophrenics.

For what it is worth George, I’m offering some design work of mine as a practical suggestion.\n\nIf you started with an antiqua-based model for your main type design, any major changes to the antiqua letter structures will likely distract the reader too much. For example;\n\nantiqua “y” \\> cursive (upright) or blackletter “y”  \nantiqua “v” \\> cursive (upright) or blackletter “v”  \ndouble story “a” \\> cursive monocular “a”  \nbinocular “g” \\> cursive monocular “g”\n\nRuling out that kind of restructuring leaves a few other axes that might be modulated for subtler changes;\n\nstressing  \nproportion  \ncomponent ratios  \nweight  \ntracking\n\nSmall variations in tracking and weight seem the most promising, while variations in stressing & proportion would have to be strictly limited to avoid messing up readability.\n\nWhat the flying fish do I mean by **component ratios**? The size of bowls in relation to stems, ascender and descender lengths, and the bowl size of individual letters in relation to each other.\n\nThis sample shows a sans serif I’m working on—-in a primitive stage of development. Sorry its too wide for the Typophile page.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105837im_/http:/typophile.com/files/one_mans_poison.png)\n\nHomely-looking isn’t it? We can forgive that because the font’s ambition is to be a casual text sans, albeit with enhanced readability.\n\nPretend it’s an antiqua type with serifs in the usual positions that departs from Griffo’s model in only two areas—-the “g” is monocular rather than binocular, and the “w” is cursive.\n\nKeep the “g” structure as it is, and pretend the “w” is an angular antiqua model, mmmkay?\n\nCheck the “g”, “p”, “q” and “y”. Those particular letters utilize the principal of ratios to determine their bowl sizes. This is aimed at increasing differentiation between similar letters to create more distinctive word pictures, and in turn increase readability. In one word—-demodularization.\n\nI wonder if component ratios could be a useful form of modulation for your concept George. Binocular “g” should support variable ratios too, if you were to use that form instead of the monocular form shown here.\n\nA book roman in a range of fine divisions of weight might have applications for emphasis, but would need high quality printing to make it effective, and tight quality control over a print run to keep it viable; small variations in press gain could defeat subtle variations in weight used in deifferent parts of a book.\n\nTracking modulation is already a proven means of emphasis and control of  \nr e a d&nbsp; s p e e d, so it wouldn’t hurt to try it again.\n\nIf you can succeed in designing the kind of type system you imagine, the main stumbling block would be the task of convincing publishers to adopt it and print appreciable quantities of books. You also need sympathetic authors to put up works to be frankensteined. Then how do you go about working with these authors to decide exactly how their texts are treated? Getting them interested in typography could be a long and complicated affair with potentially sticky politico-aesthetic disputes.\n\nAssuming those problems can be solved and don’t interfere with the management and logistics of the publishing process, publishers probably would not care how it all happens as long as the technical process is viable and editions sell in decent quantities.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

We do not know these features beforehand, and a theory of reading does not hand them to us. It just tells us what kinds of things are relevant. Overdetermined saliency maps are relevant. Proper cue value is relevant. Concentrated & ludic ’travaille sur’ articulation is a (the?) search-engine.\n\nOr so I think.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105837im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%5D%5Bimg:)\n\n"

In preparing for the presentation underlying my _Typo#13_ contribution I read parts of Frank Smith’s 1996 _Reading Without Nonsense_ and the wonderful essay “What’s the use of the Alphabet” in _Essays into Literacy : Selected Papers and Some Afterthoughts_.\n\nBut I also found [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105837/http:/www.enneson.com/public_downloads/pe/typophile/fs_psychonosci_1969.pdf) 1969 paper useful, for its emphasis on “sufficient” processing of “criterial combinations of features” “discriminated simultaneously”; and of “feature discriminability” as “the crucial variable in word identification”, and its non-dependance on a letter by letter approach.\n\n(It is one of the things that consolidate my misgivings about Hrant’s parafoveal emphasis, while keeping alive the prospects of a view that doesn’t capitulate to a letter-slot pocessing approach to visual wordform resolution. Lateral interference in the paravoveal stream causes the _what where_ of criterial features (role-architecture-level particulars and primitives) to be beyond discrimination.)\n\n"

Naturally, higher level abstract cognitive process takes up after word-picture data is read, and gestalt meaning of a text by way of ratiocination.\n\n_...biophysical or vision science level...at the visual cortex ..._\n\nAbout the visual cortex. Have you looked at axon modelling as the physical basis for memory and shape recognition? Susan Greenfield’s _Brain Story_ makes me wonder if that specific part of the human brain, using axon modelling, is involved in word shape recognition.\n\nAccording to neuroscientists the human brain has a substantially greater capacity for shape recognition than any other primate, and apparently this is linked to, or engineered by our need to recognize the differences between individual human faces—-as a survival skill.\n\nAnthropologists have taken this up as a way of helping to explain the superiority of Homo Sapiens over Neanderthals, and why Neanderthals died out. For example, if they had difficulty recognizing one individual from another, or the subtleties of facial expression, Neanderthals may also have struggled to detect a lie by reading a face, placing them at a disadvantage. In examination of artefacts like tools and personal items Neanderthals are seen to have less creative ability (they weren’t as good at crafting objects d’art).\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "Héctor, the argument of my last paragraph is that: if Frank Smith is correct about discriminability of features being fundamental to the perceptual processing component of reading, than this poses a challenge to Hrant’s claim that the bulk of recognition happens or can happen parafoveally. This poses a challenge because the ’what feature where’ information is rendered impossible to discriminate or compile, due to lateral interference. (This is not to say that some skipping based on parafoveal preview does not routinely occur.)\n\nI agree with Frank Smith that grammatical and semantic context knowledge (in the field of discourse relevent to the subject mater of the text) reduces the dependancy on visual processing in reading, to the extent that it allows the probability summation routines underlying recognition to reach sufficient confidence about lexical identity sooner.\n\nJames, I have not read Susan Greenfield’s book, but if my intuition about what axon modelling is, is correct, I’d want to say: it would be nice if axon modelling could penetrate the mechanics of probability summation to the point where is could factor in familiarity of context, and the contributions of lateral interactions at the visual cortex level.\n\nAxon modelling might also, if it can become sophisticated enough, help George with his search for what level of typographical variation is subliminally discarded as noise, and what is fed forward to the reception system as inflectionally informative. (It might also help decide between my model of perceptual processing in reading and Kevin Larson’s.)\n\n"
