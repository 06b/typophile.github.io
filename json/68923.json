It's a postcard being sent out as an invitation to my portfolio show, and I am hoping to develop 2 or 3 full size posters further developing the idea of creativity as a currency. Any and all comments welcome!\n\n[http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/9742/creativecurrency.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416053900/http:/img522.imageshack.us/img522/9742/creativecurrency.png \"http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/9742/creativecurrency.png\")\n\n",

      "content": "I like the idea and the background pattern, also the gradient.  \nMaybe the grey border is distracting, if it’s not part of the design try a white one, the colours may seem less intense.  \nI agree with riccard0 about the main type. It’s too heavy and/or the contrast is too harsh.\n\nIn print, silver would look great, at least for ‘creativity’ and ‘currency’. Or even a hologram/kinegram ;)  \nBut maybe lightening up your charcoal and a lighter weight would do.\n\nFor further (banknote) inspiration see also [http://www.bank-note.ru/security.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416053900/http:/www.bank-note.ru/security.html \"http://www.bank-note.ru/security.html\")\n\n"
