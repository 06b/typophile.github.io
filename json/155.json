      "content": "Kevin, the solution is to have the same size screens running at the same res on every desk.   \n   \nie there is no solution.   \n   \nLook at your own screen, I don't know what you're running, but with any Mac you can just switch resolution via the control strip - mine goes from 640\\*480 up to 1920\\*1080. As you can imagine, from my viewpoint, switching between those ranges of resolutions is going to result in vastly different physical text sizes.   \n   \nBut, 10 pixels is always 10 pixels.   \n   \nThe ideal solution is to use ems as measuring units - but MS fcuked this up for the world by making everyone think that a good default text size is 18px - wrong, wrong wrong.   \n   \nOn most screens a good base text size is more like about 12px, some are going to want to go up to 14px or so.   \n   \nClever people are going to try to set their preferences to a base font size that works for them, while 90% of the web designers [sic] out there are thinking to themselves \"this 18px default is far to big, I'm gonna have to size that down to (fontsize) \"2\" or 0.75em...\" and the smart people go \"huh, what's wrong with these jerk off designers, I can't read this stuff!?\".   \n   \nMaking sense, probably not.   \n   \nHere, tip from the top: if you're thinking to yourself \"10px\" is excellent text size, think again. 10px is legible on most screens, I have a problem with it on large screens and would rather have 12px - but that's not the real problem. The real problem is that you \\*cannot\\* go much below 10px, you can only realistically go to 9px.   \n   \nThere aren't enough pixels to rasterise text at 8px (specialist bitmaps aside).   \n   \nSo, if your text is 10px, and you want a picture caption/credit - you've only got 9px to go to, and there really isn't enough differentiation in the rasterised text to really show that you've done anything (it's not like 10pt and 9pt at high res).   \n   \nSo go with 12px, you can then get some decent differentiation by going to 10px for small bits. Those (few) that genuinely find 12px too big can use the text zoom to get down to 90%, those that find it too small can go up to 120%.   \n   \nSo go for the middle 80%.   \n   \nI know as web designers we all get stuck in \"it's got to be 600\\*800\", but the reality is that most people are running 1024\\*768 and higher.   \n   \n   \nJoe\n\n"

Is that what you meant?   \n   \nNetscape 4.79 is browser of choice for one reason alone: it doesn't tolerate mistakes in code as IE does. Also, given the developing nature of CSS it's a prerequisit to test in multiple browsers.   \n   \nThe issue with the highlighted page is that the functionality doesn't carry from page to page within the site, and it's poor user interface design to rely on something that will change in implementation from site to site (or even page to page). Built-in browser functionality is preferable, and more consistent.   \n   \nIt's such a good idea that MS stole the idea from it's Mac Business Unit and put it into Win browsers too.   \n   \nThe latest Nav/Mozilla releases are both stable and fast, something IE on the Mac hasn't been up to 5.1.3 (everything before was a dog!). Mac IE 5.1.3 still has bugs with encoding and form submission, but it is getting better.   \n   \nThe one thing IE does better than Nav 4.x is render complex tables quickly - but the Nav/Mozilla 6.x releases make up for that.   \n   \nAs for consistency - sure IE is more consistent, but that's just because so many people (idiots) use it as their benchmark and don't test in other browsers.   \n   \nThe really dumb thing about IE up to the most recent releases was that the Win version running under emulation in VPC was faster than the \"native\" Mac version!?\n\n"

Clean code is your future - no one wants to go back and do it again, elegance in code is just as evident as elegance in design.   \n   \nFour year's ago IE had next to no market share, things will change as development goes on in the morass that is HTML development. Right now, IMO the market choice for browsers is richer than it's ever been - there are at least three different Gecko-based browsers, IE, iCab, OmniWeb and Opera - just for the Mac. The 6.x releases of Mozilla and Netscape are pulling together nicely, the other Gecko browser, Chimera has some nice features and is well integrated into MacOS X.   \n   \nWith AOL switching its browser to a Netscape-based offering it's clear to me that the competition is far from over.   \n   \n\\<blink\\>\"My name is Joe\"\\</blink\\> (too)\n\n"

Traditionally   \nthe Mac has been the bastian for Netscape.   \n(You know the whole underdog/anti MS thing.   \nIE wasn't tied to the OS like it was on Windows.)   \nI think two years ago, about 50% of Mac users   \nwere on NS.   \n   \nSo looking at our statistics and seeing that   \n55% of our users are on Macs you'd think our   \ntotal browser stats would reflect something   \nlike 30% Netscape.   \n   \nTypophile.com Browser Stats for March '02 by   \nnumber of requests:   \n   \n188797: IE   \n\\_25568: Netscape   \n\\_\\_2560: URL\\_Access   \n\\_\\_1430: Netscape (compatible)   \n\\_\\_\\_875: Opera   \n   \nThat, about 12% NS among an audience   \nthat's 55% Mac. Two years ago it would've   \nbeen more like 50% Netscape.   \n   \nAnybody else see trends like this among Mac   \nusers? (This is no surprise to the PC crowd.)\n\n"
