That ’b’ looks like an upside-down ’q’ more than any ’b’ I know, and the ’k’ is strongly similar to mutilated Galliard. Speaking of mutilated, look at the ’T’.\n\nIt’s like a font -Frankenstein’s monster, maybe like a student’s joke font project. The letters don’t even seem to have a common baseline, or are my eyes just bleary this late in the day?\n\nJan, do you have samples of any more letters? Can you tell us the age or origin of the source for this sample?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Actually it could be somewhere from these lands, because I´m from Slovakia, althought the titles are in german (or Austrian?).  \nI know the font is similar to Serapion [http://www.stormtype.com/serap.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013183358/http:/www.stormtype.com/serap.html \"http://www.stormtype.com/serap.html\") , or Jannon [http://www.stormtype.com/jannon.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013183358/http:/www.stormtype.com/jannon.html \"http://www.stormtype.com/jannon.html\") or Tyfa [http://www.stormtype.com/tyfa.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013183358/http:/www.stormtype.com/tyfa.html \"http://www.stormtype.com/tyfa.html\") , but the letter “a” is different in all three cases.\n\nMaybe theese original samples will help.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013183358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/toskanabrot.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013183358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/backersonne.jpg)\n\n"

That makes this more credible as a font, for sure, but I think we may be exposing our weakness in Eastern European type.
