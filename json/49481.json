Of course, if it is not a ligature and the designer “rubbed out” part of the stroke on the second “s”, my theory is pretty thin.\n\nWynne Hunkler  \nPrincipal | [Wynnefields Creative](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201091016/http:/www.wynnefields.com/)  \nWeb Design & Visual Communications\n\n"

Stephen’s suggestion of Freehand 575 - Bitstreams version of another photolettering face, Jefferson Script - is about as close as you are likely to get digitally.\n\n"
