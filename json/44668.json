The counter strokes practically dissolve away.\n\nI like the look and I think thickening the counter strokes a little wouldn't have too negative effect on the over all look.\n\n"

I also don't like the length of the counter strokes on the capital E, 4, 5, they're too long. Actually, some of your counter stroke lengths seem inconsistent, and long. Such as on the U, V and W.\n\nHope I'm not being too nit-picky.\n\n"
