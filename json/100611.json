If it is, indeed. his work, the letterforms were assembled from pieces, so this particular typeface never existed as a discrete commercial product. If it’s not his work, it’s still unlikely that the typeface was ever digitized.\n\nBTW, the Oxford English Dictionary—the Ultimate Authority—spells these words in precisely the same way: «coöperation», «fœtal»—so, maybe it’s not the dictionaries that are weird. Just sayin’…\n\n"

The only words that I'd spell with diacritics in English are façade, naïve, rôle, etc. «The New Yorker» likes to spell reëlect, coöperate...\n\n"
