  "content": "Hi, I'm, new here and relatively new to the wonderful world of typography. I've spent the past weeks reading up on the topic and watching some Lynda.com courses on typography, but I'm still very much a beginner.  \nI'm designing two book covers and would like some suggestions regarding the font. One is a novel and the other one a popular philosophy book, both written by me, both containing the same philosophical message.  \nThe genre of the novel is \"inspirational\", a bit like the books of Paulo Coelho, with a romantic as well as philosophical slant.  \nThe philosophy book uses the same inspirational philosophy as the novel, but is written as non-fiction, even though it is still accessible for a general audience, i.e. it's not dry, academic stuff.  \nOn the one hand, I would like the fonts for both the novel and the philosophy book to be the same - that way readers would recognize \"the brand\". On the other hand, I would like readers to see from the font that the novel and the philosophy book are different genres.  \nI thought that maybe using a sans-serif for the novel and a serif font for the non-fiction could do the job. Is this a good idea? And, if it is, which fonts would be a good choice?  \nThe kind of qualities in the font I'm after are light-hearted as well as serious, with an emphasis on elegance, a ballance between masculine and feminine.  \nBecause the books will be sold primarily on Amazon, the font has to be clearly legible, as the thumbnails people see tend to be small.  \nI've already formatted the novel in Indesign, using Adobe Garamond Pro for both body and headings - after a lot of experimenting - just because it is so readable. However, if there is a better solution, I'm open to it.  \nI don't have lots of money for the fonts, but many fonts are quite reasonable in price, so that shouldn't be a problem.  \nThanks,  \nAntonie\n\n",
