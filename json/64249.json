That's one of the resons why I feel the \"90210\" site is so good... because he has pics of real patients. My orthodontist used to have pics of patients on the wall of his office/laboratory and everybody was always checkin out the pics on the wall.\n\nWhen it comes to art/photography, I try to heavily engage my client in the process. Sometimes they are game, sometimes not. But it may be the only way to avoid those cringes. This very issue -- needing quality, authentic photos -- was one of the main reasons I started learning photography.\n\n"
