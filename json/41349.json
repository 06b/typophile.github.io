They are relics of the hand-written word where a round form is attached to a straight line. Bloemsma decided to find out what the result would be if they were left off; this proved a difficult starting point for a typeface. Beginning with the lower case a, he drew a family of rounded yet rather asymmetrical forms with details reminiscent of brush-strokes. The individual letters rather neutral, but as a group make FF Cocon™ a typeface of spirit and character.\n\n",
