More samples can be found at the Amazon look inside preview. The ISBN is 978-0-8112-1602-9.\n\nThanks!  \nTom\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2013-06-29 at 21.48.26.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140414005558/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-06-29%20at%2021.48.26.png) | 275.35 KB |\n\n",
