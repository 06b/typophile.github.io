Currently our company uses Garamond 11pt for most of the body copy, which appears very professional and has always been one of my favorites. Helvetica (Neue is the sans serif.) But I need to distinguish myself from my current company, and while I'm in no way a designer, I do pay attention to the look and feel of my documents.\n\nSuggestions? Didot/Optima? Berling/Franklin Gothic? Palatino/Whitney? Please help! I'm out of my league and want to start off right.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
