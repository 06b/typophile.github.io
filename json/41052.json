  "content": "I found a script within this forum to change footnotes to endnotes and it work beautifully. Thank you. I only wish it was yesterday as I spent ali day exporting to word and back.  \nProblem is that the endnotes with the script and my manual methond start from N0.1 which means I have to have the document as one file when I really would prefer to have it more managable as smaller files within a book. Footnotes work because you can start each file with any number but the script converted this back to start No.1.  \nHas anyone solved this?  \nMuch appreciative  \nChuck\n\n",
