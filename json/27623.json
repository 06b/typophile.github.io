  "content": "Im not sure how good this despcription is. Its the font used on Satyricons Intermezzo II Ep in 1999, on the booklet side, song list and credits. Its pretty gothic, but with this nice sharp scandinavian finishing. I didnt find any font quite like it. So far Ness from Fountain [http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ness\\_reg.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112607/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ness_reg.asp \"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ness\\_reg.asp\") goes closest. But i wonder if this Bodin's font is available for purchase anywhere?\n\nCheers\n\n",
