(I remember doing the like once … long ago…).  \nGreat utilization of colour, too.\n\nOne could place the uncial shape for e/epsilon, which should be acceptable for Cyrillic as well, in the centre. Omega as w is hurting. And the v-glyph for Nu …?  \nU serving as ‘Upsilon’ doesn’t satisfy me. It seems illogical to me not to unify y and upsilon.  \nHowever, I would definitely unify the Greek-Cyrillic lambda and delta (triangular shapes) and also tri-unify the M.  \nAnd if it’s to serve not only major languages, two Serbian letters would have to be added on the Cyrillic side; the same for Eth and Thorn and Eng in Latin.\n\nHow many Eurocase fonts are on the market already?\n\n<cite>… fine without J and V</cite>\n\nthan please kill U and W too.\n\n"

I suppose to be really hardcore, the common glyphs should have multiple Unicodes. I'm not sure how well that would be supported by layout applications.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nI suspect there may be a few typefaces with Greek Unicase. Any Cyrillic unicase fonts?\n\nFor Greek especially, it seems that a lot is dependent on the typeface. The balance of upper and lower case letter forms that one seeks in a unicase typeface varies considerably from sans to serif: the typical Greek sans serif lower case glyphs are much more similar to the upper case than their serifed counterparts.\n\n"

It’s about “how to make things easier and more simple“. Which is a legitimate approach in general.  \nI remember a saying (from who?): “ things should be as simple as possible but not simpler than that.” – and there it gets interesting. Killing c and q and v is a nice exercise of the mind but of virtual no relevance to practice. But: “how can I make a L-G-C font more efficiently?” IS of practical relevance.\n\nLatin and Cyrillic sprang off the Greek alphabet Hundreds of years ago, yet remained close relative all the time. Now we face the novelty of the three re-united in one single lettercase. That raises the question of practical rationalization and aesthetic harmonization (or however you wish to call it), this is only consequential in my eyes.\n\n"
