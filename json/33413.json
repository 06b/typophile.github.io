  "content": "Hello,  \nI am looking for a very simple font but having a hard time finding something with a tad bit of personality also. I need it to be sans serif (mostly), perfect circle Os, and a soft organic quality to it. I have been using Gotham and Kurosawa sans so I am looking for something along those lines. I might try out a serif too as long as it doesn't feel \"heavy\" which is the problem I am having while using the more legible bold gotham. I don't think I want it too flowy, just soft, delicate.\n\n(This is my first time posting here so please excuse any breaking of protocol. I searched for this topic but wasn't able to find a particular posting so if it already exists, please do point me to it. Thanks!)\n\n",
