  "content": "My first semi-serious attempt. Intentionally not a very original typeface; the proportions are very Bodonian, while there's a lot of Fleischmann and some Dwiggins influence in the details. There's bound to be a lot of beginner's mistakes, I know, please tell me, so I can improve. Any kind of critique is very welcome indeed. The spacing is still very basic.\n\nEr, and hello, everyone. This is my very first post, after lurking for several weeks. What a wonderful resource Typophile is! I only wish I'd discovered it sooner.\n\nS.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417141236im_/http:/typophile.com/files/austeria_4939.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [austeria.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417141236/http:/typophile.com/files/austeria.pdf) | 70.73 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for your comment! You are perfectly right about the k, and I see a lot of other problems now as well, as I've just made the first paper prints. I will make a lot of adjustments. There pdf has some strange alignment errors, by the way. I will post a revised version soon.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your reply, Eliason, you're absolutely right. The odd angles are all gone now. In fact, every single glyph is revised, and I've updated the preview image and the pdf. I've also started working on a boldface, but I'm resisting the temptation of starting work on the italic. (Gee, this is really ruining my social life.)\n\nPlease, tell me what you think!\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, as a matter of fact, I've made such a ligature for [Schola](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417141236/http:/typophile.com/node/56025), the typeface I'm working on at the moment. It's not shown in the specimen, though, but I will upload some text setting examples showing it later today, after a bit of spacing and kerning.\n\nFí is a very frequent letter combination in Old Norse and Icelandic, as you probably know.\n\nI've abandoned work on Austeria, it was my very first attempt at drawing a typeface, and I think it needs major redrawing. Perhaps I'll start anew when Schola is finished; I still like the idea of mixing Fleischmann's quirkiness with Bodoni's austerity. I think Jorge Luis Borges would have liked such a typeface.\n\n"
