It does not neccesarily need to be super cheap - id like to get her something nice. jewlery? handmade typographic clock? i am at a loss here.\n\nany thoughts?\n\n",

Or no digits at all -- assign letters and reinvent her concept of time. I'm sure she'll be into meeting you for a date at L:RC o'clock. Plus, making it yourself beats anything you'll find for sale at veer (sorry veer).\n\nThe best typographic gift I recieved was the \"CTS Photo display catalog\" (a phone book sized type specimen collection). Not the most obscure collection, but for graphic designers, seeing a face in print helps with type choice far better than screen previews. Plus, there's a perverse collection of swashes and unseemly ligatures.\n\n"
