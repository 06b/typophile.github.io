We will be hosting auditions for this online collaboration here on Typophile.\n\nTypical songs include the following hits:\n\n- Baby, kern me closer to you\n- (Yves) Peters, give me one more chance\n- The Futura Is Now\n- And much much more!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080128181029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_5601.gif)\n\nBoth Bram and I play drums, guitar, bass, and we can sing a little too. We’re in need of the following:\n\nA flugelhorn  \nAn Alpenhorn  \nA singerist  \nA manager  \nThe other stuff in the smarmy little graphic above with the horrendous font  \nEtc., you name it!\n\nWe’re also excepting lyricistical ideas and mumblings. Please feel free to submit a link to something. Anything really. As long as it is good. Or not.\n\nI live in Seattle, Bram lives in Portland, and you live? We’ll have to figure out the details later, but rest assured, we have the frontman straight from Typecon2007:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080128181029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/20070428_0013_3564.jpg)\n\n [‹ Native languages are dying out](http://web.archive.org/web/20080128181029/http:/typophile.com/node/37315 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Client Advice ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080128181029/http:/typophile.com/node/37587 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
