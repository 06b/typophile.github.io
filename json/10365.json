I have a good deal of respect for most of you and must thank you for the knowledge you make available.   \n   \nHere's a link to some of my stuff:   \n [http://natenielson.com/type/type.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417143316/http:/natenielson.com/type/type.html)   \n   \nMost are, well, crappy but some are pretty mediocre if I do say-so myself. If you can bring yourself to critique something I'll be pleased. If you can say even more, I'll be happy. And if you're harsh, I'll be overjoyed.   \n   \nnate\n\n",

Some of your other \"ethnic\" (for lack of a better descriptor) faces are interesting as well (Runestick in particular).   \n   \nAre there any that you're currently working on and trying to refine? Maybe a more focused critique would be helpful   \n   \neric\n\n"

Hah!   \n   \nI never consciously thought, \"i'm gunna make a font.\" It's been as if something possessed me, whether I liked it or not. So having been a designer (with an MFA no less) and never studied type, what could I do?... Haunt, and try to apply what I learned.   \n   \nSo this is what I have to show after a year. Don't ask me where I got the nerve to post 'em though.   \n   \nnate\n\n"

I especially like **Ockiahex**...\n\nAny chance that you’ll develop uppercase characters and numerals for it? It might be difficult to have a “true” uppercase if you want to stick to the hexagonal motif, but making the typeface unicase might be a good solution…\n\n"
