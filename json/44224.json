      "content": "The first font is very similar to House Script, from the Signpainter’s set by House Indusries. A little different in the capitals, but the lower case letters are almost identical.\n\nSecond one is Compacta, for sure.\n\nThird could be Futura Bold Extra Condensed,-but it’s not- or even Avenir BC. Looks a bit French to me...\n\nLast looks a bit like Antique Olive, but it isn’t. I don’t think it’a a proper font, because it’s rather badly made. Compare the (lack of) balance between the M and the C, and also note the very bad Y. Also, the S looks funny.\n\nI hope this is of some help\n\n"

      "content": "The top one is the predigital film font Jackson Script, although it’s been manually slanted a bit more and heavied up. The only digital versions I’m aware of are [QBF’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821145511/http:/www.qbf.de/dceng.htm) [Louisiana](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821145511/http:/www.qbf.de/cart/cart.exe?gif=dc.gif/Sdc02658.gif) and an [Opti](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821145511/http:/www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html) version (not sure of the name). Note that many of those QBF Designer Collection fonts were 1994 clones of the Opti equivalents, which were made 3 or 4 years earlier even. As such, the digital technology and know-how were in their early stages and the fonts were, by today’s standards, poorly made.\n\nThe only other option I know of: [Stuart Sandler](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821145511/http:/www.fontdiner.com/) now has the rights to the old Filmotype collection and he, with the help of others, is slowly digitizing the faces and [offering them for sale](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821145511/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&category=1220&keywords=all). If you aren’t in a hurry, you could contact Stuart about where Jackson Script is in the queue.\n\n"
