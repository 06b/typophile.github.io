  "content": "Hi all,\n\nCurrently working on a promotional poster for myself... I have purchased Blender Pro as a sort of logotype font for myself, and am looking for something that complements it. I know Blender Pro/Gridnik can read quite well as a body copy font, but I don't really want to detract from the logo.\n\nIf you guys have any suggestions about what fonts would complement Blender Pro (yet still differentiate itself), I'd love to hear them. Right now I am playing around with flama light/thin. I like the way it has a more fluid and round (sort of how Blender varies from Gridnik), but thought I'd just try some other things out!\n\nThanks,  \nBen\n\n",
