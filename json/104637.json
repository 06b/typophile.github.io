  "content": "Using a nice sketchy font called Karabine, but it has no capital letters and very limited symbols (such as no £ etc.). I need to identify which font it has been based on so I can create the missing symbols from the right lettershapes. Or an alternate font which has a more complete set of symbols would be a big help also. Any help would be really appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [karabine-font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823124834/http:/typophile.com/files/karabine-font.jpg) | 38.36 KB |\n\n",
