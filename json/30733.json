      "content": "Hi, Aleksander. The first thing you should ask yourself is _why_ you'd like it to be more funky and handmade-like. In other words, what purpose would that serve? What point would it make about the cleaning company? If you just want the logo to look trendy, it might look outdated in a few months, and a logo has to stand the test of time, among other things.\n\nWhen you say you know it should be clean, professional and \"white\", there is probably a reason for this, i.e., because these visual characteristics are known to transmit the idea of \"clean\". Perhaps you want this logo to stand out from the competition? Are their logos similar to this one?\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Ricardo,\n\nI was thinking about handmade typeface to reflect the process of cleaning as \"hand made\" activity. That's why I created those two hands. I don't want the logo to look trendy. I'm far from that. I just wanted to put more energy in it and make both the sign and typeface looking consistent.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n AL  \n [lenart.pl](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024045026/http:/www.lenart.pl/)\n\n"
