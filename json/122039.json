I've been using FontShop as one of my main sources, but, their recent redesign has been hateful to me. The site is barely usable, and not at all useful, especially looking for a Greek font.\n\nI apologize if this post is one of striking ignorance, but I am self-training and limited in the most important resources of any field, experience and understanding. Any direction is greatly appreciated, whether a font recommendation, a place to search more effectively, or a search term that will help me turn the needed results.\n\nThanks for helping,  \nAdam\n\n",
