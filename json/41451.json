  "content": "I've seen this font used in AMC's self-promotion on air and on their website. It's similar to Rockwell or Aachen but different. In particular, the upper-case \"R\" has a curl in the leg that points up. I can't find an example of that but perhaps that will help in the identification. You can visit AMCtv.com for more examples of usage. I've attached one with the most characters visible here.\n\n[http://typophile.com/files/Picture](http://web.archive.org/web/20120428180610/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture \"http://typophile.com/files/Picture\") 1\\_39.jpg\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nJenkin\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120428180610/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_39.jpg) | 10.44 KB |\n\n",
