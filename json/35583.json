As it so happens, the Offenbach (near Frankfurt, Germany) [Typostammtisch](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018092740/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/typostammtisch/pool/) meets tonight. We've successfully pulled this off every month for over three years now, and even tangentially inspired a similar sort of event in [Berlin](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018092740/http:/www.fontwerk.com/504/berliner-typostammtisch-0707-zusammenfassung/). Good luck! This sort of thing should happen more often…\n\n"

      "content": "A belated report on our last meeting:\n\nEverything went swimmingly. Mark from Veer attended and offered great advice on moving our club forward, participated in the Name Debate, reported on TypeCon and gave insights into Veer's workings. Mark, thanks for attending. And thankyou for your generosity! Completely uncalled for but still much appreciated. We bought a round to toast your health!!\n\nMark left a bag of Veer-Swag, including Activity Books and buttons, which will be available to attendees of our September meeting.\n\nDave B. reported that he was moved to leave the lurker pool and become a member of Typophile. I don't think he's posted anything yet, but it's nice to have another Calgary face on Typophile. (If I can get on my soapbox for a bit...this is exactly how I see a type club working. It's a chance for people with an interest in type to meet, share resources and foster enthusiasm. Oh, yeah, and there's beer.) Congratulations, Dave, and welcome to Typophile!\n\nThe great Name Debate is still ongoing. We've short-listed our favourites and we'll decide on one of those in September. Dave apparently wasn't satisfied with merely submitting names...he showed up with logos! So, in typical type-geek fashion, we've picked a logo already even though we haven't settled on a name. How does that work? (Hopefully Dave will post the logo for critique on this forum.)\n\nLex was unable to attend, and we want his input on the Name Debate. So, Lex, you've got a month to come up with something better than what we've short-listed!\n\nOn the agenda for the September meeting: Mike's illustrated letters, discussion of a membership push at the local Art+Design College, the possibility of getting a local gallery to host a Type Show. And Lex's report on how the movie is going ;-)\n\n"
