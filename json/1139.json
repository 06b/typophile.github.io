Is this usual if you want to make a 'good' type?   \nMy points are now ad random in place. I will correct this if it makes the font better. Any thoughts on this subject?   \n   \nI saw on a laserwriter print I made that some characters look thicker. Can it be this has to do with the gridfitting?   \n   \nThanks,   \nRen\n\n",

As pointed out, when a Postscript Type 1 font is generated from this data, all those coordinates will be rounded. The PS T1 spec requires coordinates as integers.   \n   \nThis will inevitably lead to grief as, for instance, your top horizontal will become narrower and your bottom will become wider.   \n   \nBTW, at high-resolution 2540 dpi output, your type would have to be set at 57 pt or larger before the rasterizer could actually render the difference of 0.5 em unit. Lower-resolution output would need to be even larger.   \n   \nDo as James says and use the Points \\> Align to Points feature. I also recommend setting File \\> Preferences \\> Editing Behavior so that Grid spacing = 1 em unit (I think that might be the default, but check). Then turn on View \\> Snap to Grid. This will keep your point placement on the whole numbers.   \n   \nOr use FontLab.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"
