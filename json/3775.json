I see it is a flavor mmh.. but i dont like it much   \n   \nThe lc 'z' looks 'left-italic' (maybe it is the gif)   \n   \nGreetings Jens\n\n"

      "content": "First, I would say this is essentially a sans face. Those occasional flare serifs remind of Profile. I would emphasize them, because it will pull the design away from the overcrowded pool of humanist sans fonts that we're drowning in.   \n   \nIt looks like a pretty functional design. The only lc glyph that's strange is the \"g\": I'd make the head not so tall, and make the tail open. But many of the curves are \"wobbly\", like in the lc \"s\" - this is your biggest quality issue, to me. And I see that you have some trapping (like in the lc \"w\"), which is fine, but leave that until after you've finished the base forms.   \n   \nThe caps are pretty interesting. Put flares on the \"C\" and the \"T\", make the head of the \"P\" larger, and the tail of the \"Q\" thinner but longer. It would be nice to see some all-caps text.   \n   \nI've heard that the Florin has to always slant, and I think the Pilcrow needs a dark patch: it has to stand out. Your accents are smaller than usual, but to be honest I'm not sure that's bad (and it depends on the language)...   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
