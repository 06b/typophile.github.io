  "content": "Can anyone help me find a UK supplier of Wood Type Impressions, Vol. 1 or Vol. 2 by 'Without Walls'. I'm reluctant to pay huge shipping cost from USA. It is a DVD full of really nice grayscale tiffs of nice wood type letters.\n\nWe're currently working on a project that requires some genuine looking wood type. Trying to recreate o wood type effect using photoshop just doesn't do it!\n\nOr if anyone could suggest an alternative I'd be grateful!\n\n",
