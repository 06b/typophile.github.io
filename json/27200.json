  "content": "This week there are two programmes featuring typography to be broadcast in the UK.   \n   \nThursday 10 February, 9pm, Channel 4: 'Blood On Our Hands: The English Civil War'. Printing features in this episode and Nigel Roche, Librarian of St Bride Library, demonstrates typesetting at the time in an atmospheric location (Kentwell's Bakehouse) - complete with smoke and fog for added drama.   \n   \nFriday 11 February, 11am, BBC Radio 4: 'From Arial to Wide Latin'. From the BBC web site: 'Ian Peacock explores how the fonts we chose are sending secret subliminal messages about who we are. He argues that the fonts we dress our words in are as much of a fashion statement as the clothes we wear.'   \n   \nIf you're not in the UK you can still catch the Radio 4 broadcast using the BBC's listen again service: details on [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804201320/http:/www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/)   \n   \n. . . . . . . .   \n   \nInformation from [St Bride Printing Library](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804201320/http:/www.stbride.org/index.htm)\n\n",
