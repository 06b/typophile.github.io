Because most of what he says makes sense.\n\nIf we all \"develop our own typographic sensibilities\" we will wind up with a world where Comic Sans is appropriate for tombstones and funeral invitations.\n\nFirst you learn the rules. They you learn how to break the rules. (It doesn't work the other way round.)\n\n"

Beef up the weight with the Stroke feature in your layout application--you can add reaaaaly small amounts.  \n4. Optional, increase horizontal scaling, say to 103 or 104%.\n\nThis is my practice, but as James says, develop your own sensibility as to which of these techniques you employ, and exactly what values you assign to the variables.\n\n"
