Please make sure the AFDKO is installed, and the system environment variable PATH  \ncontains the path the to FDK sub-directory containing 'autohintexe'.  \n\"\n\nDavid, do you use the AFDKO macros in Fontlab, and if so, could you do me a favor and try running them?\n\nI thought I'd just try installing the newest version of the AFDKO, but of course the zip is missing a whole bunch of stuff, namely a lot of the macros system files needed.\n\n"

I'd be curious to hear if more people have experienced this slowdown.\n\n"

When I pressed 1 to return to the pointer tool nothing happened. I also lost the z and x zoom ability. Also lost was the delete key function and the command x for cut. These functions continued to work when selected via menu. When I pressed the ` key for high rez preview the preview remained after I released the key. Cursor keys continued to function.\n\nOn other occasions I have lost cursor key function. It is all appears to be random. I will pay closer attention to see if I can identify a pattern.\n\n"

A glitchy font file might be to blame here, I'll have to see if it happens again with a different font. In using my Wacom tablet, I find the screen scrolls up by a couple of inches whenever I put pen to tablet, but it's done that since Snow Leopard, so I'm not too concerned (though I'd love to have a fix for this).\n\nCheers,\n\nOliver\n\n"

On my MacPro (almost) everything is working, but on my MacbookPro the “assign to keyboard” button is not working, clicking on button or triangle next to it is doing nothing. So, it works on MacPro but not on MacBookPro, any idea? Thanks!\n\n"
