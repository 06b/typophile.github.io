  "content": "Hi, I'm new to these forums and am having some trouble getting a font I'm working on off the ground. I'm using FontLab Studio and currently everything exports fine, except when I'm in Adobe InDesign the small font \"preview\" does not show up next to the name like all the other fonts do. It is in the right order, and the typeface itself works fine, but for some reason that little preview with the name of the font does not show up on the font menu. Oddly enough the font preview shows up in MS Word, but not InDesign. Any idea why this might be?\n\n",
