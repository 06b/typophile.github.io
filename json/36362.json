  "content": "I'm looking at a overhaul of our newspaper. We're currently using two typefaces, one for news and one for features, but [the Guardian's](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018040454/http:/www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/tryit/0,16469,1564647,00.html) redesign a couple of years ago - especially the mono-typeface all the way through - interests me.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for other families of typefaces that could be used throughout a newspaper for both body and headlines with a range of thicknesses and an italic style? We're looking at using 9pt on a 10.75pt baseline grid for body and headlines up to about 90pt. We're more of a news magazine though, our format is just a little smaller than tabloid and printed on silk 115gsm.\n\nThe paper is going for quite a spacious look too, especially on feature pages.\n\nAny pointers would be great! Cheers...\n\n",
