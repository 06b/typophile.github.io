  "content": "Hey Typophiles,\n\nSo I am working on a treatment for a high-scale catering company and just did some quick sketches (well not so quick for me…)\n\nHere is the question: should I use existing fonts and then apply the ornaments or try to draw cleaner versions and then trace in illustrator….\n\nI think for sure i’ll have to trace the ornaments in illustrator, but what about the fonts? should I use existing ones? any recommendations?\n\nAny other suggestions or feedback are appreciated…\n\n\\* I am not lazy, it’s just my caligraphic skills are very poor…. \\*\\*\n\nThanks so much!!  \n-p\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cb01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20061127143809/http:/typophile.com/files/cb01.jpg) | 23.04 KB |\n| [cb02.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20061127143809/http:/typophile.com/files/cb02.jpg) | 41.75 KB |\n\n",

I do all the production work, varying from tight to rough sketches, for John Langdon’s ambigrams ( [http://www.johnlangdon.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20061127143809/http:/www.johnlangdon.net/)), as a reference.\n\nThis image may also help you, if you decide to do it yourself…bezier handles revealed on one of John’s logos, his finish, not mine:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/aq_6259.png)\n\n"

I would suggest that your S is rather wide, adjusting it will mean your last flourish will also have to be amended. I would also look at the usual stresses of the middle of an S.  \nTim\n\n"
