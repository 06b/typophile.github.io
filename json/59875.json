The aim is to showcase typefaces in action.\n\nWe've started off with a small collecton of images showcasing the role of typefaces in promoting the world's favorite confectionery, chocolate. We plan to grow the gallery into a large archive.\n\nAs well as our own material, we'd welcome any Gallery contributions from users of our typefaces-which can be e-mailed to [gatf1@live.com](mailto:gatf1@live.com) in .png, .jpg or .pdf formats. A fully licensed copy of Absinette Regular will be supplied to everyone whose work is displayed in the gallery. Feel free to base your work on any of out faces (including the free ones on Myfonts.com) and let us know your prefered format for Absinette regular .ttf or .otf, as well as what acknowledgement you'd like your ontribution to be credited with.\n\nIn the mentime come and brows in our [gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017183213/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/gallery/).\n\n",
