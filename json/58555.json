I know that I am asking the impossible but is there any font out there that has any chance of printed cleanly at this size? If it could be read with really strong reading glasses (or by Superman) it would be a major victory.\n\nI am thinking condensed sans of some type. I will need a book and bold weight in both standard and italic.\n\nThe character of the font is not important other than it’s ability to be read smaller than anything should ever be printed.\n\ntia\n\npbc\n\n",

And I’m sorry to say that Michael’s Pseudo is not very legible in small sizes, but it does look rather smart in normal sizes and up.\n\n"

Thanks for the tip on the weight.\n\nThanks everyone else for the tips - Miniscule seems interesting - I have downloaded the specimen and will print and take a look.\n\nThis piece is for England so I have contacted the printers (who have experience doing tickets) and asked for advice.\n\nI work in the concert industry and some of the legalese is amazing.\n\nI have seen ads from Live Nation for one band. The legalese:  \n“All artists, dates, and venues subject to change without notice”.\n\nSo exactly what am I buying a ticket for?\n\nAm I buying a ticket for Rod Stewart and when I get there Ozzy Osbourne is going to be playing?\n\nI have talked to all our agents and they tell me that this “legalsese” has never saved anyone, from anything. If the artist doesn’t play you give refunds. Period.\n\nLawyers, bah…\n\npbc\n\n"

Be aware, however, that Amplitude does not include italics, which you indicated in your brief.\n\nFB’s [Griffith Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20090605100546/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GriffithGothic) is based on Bell Gothic, but includes italics. I could provide a sample of that as well.\n\nWhat you might really need is a dedicated agate, like Font Bureau’s [Poynter Gothic Agate](http://web.archive.org/web/20090605100546/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/PoynterAgate) or H&FJ’s [Retina](http://web.archive.org/web/20090605100546/http:/designarchives.aiga.org/entry.cfm/eid_440).
