  "content": "Hi Team!\n\nI would really appreciate your advice. My client is looking for a body copy face that that gives a sense of being 'carved' on the page. She's looking for a sense of ancient.\n\nFurther, she described it as kind of industrial, elegant...not a warm, personal, intimate feeling, but more industrial, with a sense of iron...but not too austere...\n\nFor chapter headers she's liking Goudy Trajan, but personally, I think its tired so we're looking for a replacement for that as well.\n\nThe book contains poetry, so for the most part, the text will not be dense on the page.\n\nHere's her current choice, of which I was no part. Any ideas?\n\nThank you!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804063717im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_3817.JPG)\n\n",
