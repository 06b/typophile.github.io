(Please have a look at the attached screenshot).  \nI have tried to create the letters in FL, but that's impossible.  \nI need a tool, where I can import a whole .otf or .ttf-font, and then made my color-addings ...  \nIn advance, thanks for any help :-)\n\nBest,  \nMorten\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Skærmbillede .jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317174807/http:/typophile.com/files/Sk%C3%A6rmbillede%20_2.jpg) | 146.84 KB |\n\n",
