  "content": "Greetings,\n\nThe task is to properly kern and track a logotype that I created in Adobe Illustrator. I'm really bad at kerning, but have a deep appreciation for it. The logotype is a highly modified version of Helvetica Extended. The shapes of the glyphs are completely unique to the design and don't resemble the Helvetica root at all.\n\nI will pay $100 by business check to the right individual for the job. You must be a reputable type aficionado with kerning prowess, and trustworthy.\n\nTask Details:  \nThe letterforms are outlined in a .ai file and no longer in an editable text format. As such, this will require an expert eye and Illustrator skill in particular for manually kerning and tracking the letterforms.\n\nThe kerning and tracking must be carefully considered based on the specific look of the logotype.\n\nNo modifying the letterforms in any way.\n\nThe logotype consists of seven letters and a TM symbol.\n\nI'd prefer not to share the logotype publicly at this time.\n\n",
