They're on [my blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821065211/http:/kwraps.tumblr.com/post/47937951004/typography).\n\nEveryone, feel free to add to this. I'm sure there's a lot of terms I haven't thought of. Even if you can't make a rhyme, just give me a couple words and I'll see what I can do.\n\nI'm trying to add the line \"Shout out to Johannes Gutenberg\" but not sure how to rhyme it.\n\n"
