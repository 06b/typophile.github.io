And of course McQueen adds style to this overall picture.  \nI'm normally not into this swashy script thing, but here all elements of the photo are showing nice interactions. Next time i look twice at those scripts.\n\n"

Check out the [‘S’ in American Cursive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414170247/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2342221253/).\n\n<cite>it’s too ornate to be done by hand no?</cite>\n\nI agree. Still, (a lot of) kids in the US have to learn writing like that. Apart from the minsucule ‘e’ with the mirrored 3 shape – which is another American speciality – , the sample exhibits the same ductus as the cursives taught in school there.\n\n"
