Sorry. A bit closer would be a version of Trooper Roman Black manually condensed. Digitally, this would include Fontbank’s [Talon Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908123222/http:/www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/talon.htm) (not the greatest quality and with a tilted ’O’) and [Jason Castle’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908123222/http:/www.castletype.com/) [Trooper Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908123222/http:/www.castletype.com/catalog.html) - which, for some reason, appears in his PDF catalog, but nowhere else on his website. I know of nothing closer and look forward to someone else solving this.\n\n"
