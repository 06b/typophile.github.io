The “Franklin’s Caslon” font set is digitized from the actual printed pieces produced by Ben Franklin’s printing enterprises. Unlike the “Caslon Antique” font that has seen wide use over the last decade, this one really is a Caslon design and a perfect decorative companion to the Lanston Caslon font set. Available as a packaged CD or as a download: [http://www.p22.com/products/franklin.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109060807/http:/www.p22.com/products/franklin.html)  \nThe introductory sale price will be 20% off, only $23.96 until March 15th 2006.\n\nAlso,\n\nOur newly expanded Dada Opentype package, made to coincide with the major Dada exhibition at the National Gallery in Washington DC, is an expanded version of the P22 Dada font. As an Opentype font, it has over 500 glyphs and its special features create some unexpected design results.  \nThis set is made in a special edition package that we had some fun in designing. It is also available at a special  \nprice of $19.95, for more information see: [http://www.p22.com/products/dada\\_se.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109060807/http:/www.p22.com/products/dada_se.html \"http://www.p22.com/products/dada\\_se.html\")\n\nDon’t forget our other specials: [http://www.p22.com/specials.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109060807/http:/www.p22.com/specials.html \"http://www.p22.com/specials.html\")\n\nThat is all for now.\n\nBest Regards  \nP22 type foundry\n\n",
