[Linotype's original Metro](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714000705/http:/www.linotype.com/215/metroseries.html) is probably the most authentic digitization, if that's what you're shooting for. The reason you may have missed it is that its three styles have one word names -- [Metrolite](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714000705/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/metrolite_no_2_roman/), [Metromedium](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714000705/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/metromedium_no_2_roman/), and [Metroblack](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714000705/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/metroblack_no_2_roman/)&nbsp;-- so they don't always appear in searches for \"Metro\".\n\n"

It would have to have old style numerals.\n\nOK When Bruce Rogers designed Centaur he worked directly with a broad pen over bleached out enlargements of the a 15th century typeface by Nicholas Jenson. So ITC Legacy Sans is also based on Jensons letters perhaps would this be worth trying. It does look a little wide for headlines though. Is it for a magazine?\n\n"
