      "content": "Thanks for the link. Was easier with it using Chengyin Liu's [Whatfont Google Chrome extension](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317065150/http:/chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html) as it's embedded as WebFont. That's [Wigrum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317065150/http:/www.batfoundry.com/catalogue_9_wigrum_.html) by Bureau des Affaires Typographiques (BAT). It looks like to mix influences from Futura, aforementioned Aperçu and [Neutraface 2 HI](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317065150/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2). First time seeing it in action. Thanks!\n\n"
