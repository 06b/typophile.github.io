True that Hobo for the french was not ideal but I just could not get hold of a good version of the Metro font used in the original Tyopmania clip...  \nFeel free to give us some feedback & critics!\n\n"

Erik often greets me and other guys in the office with a “hey, big boy” when he comes to visit San Francisco. Not in the melodramatic girly tone most Americans use it but more like a matter-of-fact father: “how are things, son?” It’s quite amusing.\n\n"
