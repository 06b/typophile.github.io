There, I've said it. Somebody had to. I just hope you folks who do the work are not personnaly offended because I need your help.\n\nI need a way to grade the legibility of the reports I get so that I can give reasonable, understanable, non-offending suggestions for improvement. Talk about fonts, serifs, kerning,  \nleading, and contrast, all comon terms in theoretical discussion, don't hold a candle to eyeball comparison of real copy to a recognized stanard of a known grade.\n\nI need a book of examples of copy that have been graded by thousands of people who put them in order of legibility by saying, e.g., this is better than that, I would need a glass for this, etc. With proper analysis, the pages could be marked as to the percent of that population that would have trouble reading the copy presented for grading.\n\n\\>\\>\\>\\>\\>\\> Does anything like this exist? Are there grading or testing services that I could suggest?\n\nBTW, I have muy screen set to the smallest type size, but only part of the Typophile screen is displayed. I have to cut my line lengths short to keep my copy on the screen. Must it be this way? Am I missing something?\n\nI will be away June 23 to July 7. ===gm===\n\n",
