  "content": "Does anyone have any knowledge of work that's been done to try and innovate past the typical look of 7-segment display systems. Example of typical 7 segment display attached:\n\nThis may be a case where the technology necessitates a very limited range of style, but I was hoping to find some example of this display format being pushed past it's familiar ubiquitous look. It seems the only variations out there are whether the whole character is vertical or oblique and the thickness of the stems.\n\nI have looked in the FSI Font Book, but even the similar typefaces there (LCD, Quartz) offer nothing new stylistcally and are not even consistent with the segment limitations. (meaning because they are designed to only mimic real segemeted displays.. they do not actually limit themselves to the same restriction for all characters)\n\nThis is for a project that is using an actual LCD segmented display so I can't do any cheating. Any insight, ideas, or links would be much appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [85px-Seven\\_segment\\_display-animated.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015153931/http:/typophile.com/files/85px-Seven_segment_display-animated.gif) | 25.76 KB |\n\n",

That's pretty much the extent of the evolution I've seen.\n\nDoes it have to be limited to seven segments?

Given that the segments are what they are, have you considered playing with the speed and sequence in which the various segments are lit up? You'd have to construct your own driver circuit instead of using an off-the-shelf BCD decoder/driver (that's easy to do) and interface it to some kind of sequencer -- your computer, for example. You might get some interesting visual artifacts.\n\n"
