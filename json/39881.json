  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI was recently working on a project where i thought the title really needed a serif font with a wide swashed capital J. I could really imagine what i was looking for, yet i’m not sure if this is from memory or just fantasy :)\n\nI found something vaguely similar to what i’m after in the image below, yet what I’m particularly thinking of is slightly more modern and bigger, wider swashes.\n\nAny suggestions would be highly appreciated!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071209082625im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cherylbailey_5087.jpg)\n\n [‹ Does anybody know what this is?
