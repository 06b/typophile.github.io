This will be a twin-loop / double-wire binding so the pages will be spread apart ~1/6th” when opened opposed to a perfect bind which would obscure the middle.\n\nQuestions  \nHow do I decide where to place the image, the text (inc. colophon)  \nSome thoughts about text hierarchy  \nMaintaining some sort of order between posters that vary in size (width kept the same)\n\nThe book is 11x17, bound as demonstrated by the spread\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [posterbook.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20090428005037/http:/typophile.com/files/posterbook.pdf) | 828.63 KB |\n\n",
