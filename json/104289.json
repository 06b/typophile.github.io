  "content": "Hi Everyone- I'm hoping you can help me out. I'm getting married on September 7. I just received my wedding invitations from a vendor on Etsy. The invitations were supposed to look like the picture, however, they showed up with black and dark pink ink instead of dark gray and light pink. I can't go back to the original vendor who messed up because she’s (conveniently) on vacation until July 14. And I can't change my wedding colors this late in the game. I can, however, recreate the invitation and reprint it in the right color ink. I just need to find out what font she used. Any ideas?? Thank you for your help!!!!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822133730im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Invitation_4189.jpg)\n\n",
