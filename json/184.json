One nib is   \n2mm for ordinary everyday writing (checks, forms,   \nletters, envelopes) and the 5mm nib is great for   \ndrawing big letters.   \n   \nAs far as books go, I'm hoping to get my hands   \non Doyald Young's _Fonts & Logos_ one day   \nsoon. For great examples of blackletter, you have   \nto learn German and buy Koch's _Die Schrift als   \nKunstfertigkeit_ and Julius de Goede's   \n_Kalligraphie mit gotischen und Frakturschriften_   \n\"Lehrbuch.\"   \n   \nI'm trying to improve my Dutch as well, as so   \nmany great books on type and lettering are written   \nin Dutch. It's pretty easy if you learn German   \nfirst.   \n   \nFor blackletter **type** , nothing beats Peter Bain   \nand Paul Shaw's _Blackletter: Type and National   \nIdentity_ . Also indispensible is Albert Kapr's   \n_Fraktur_. Kapr is in German.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi, here jacques writting.   \nyou should not forget to buy strong paper. I always explained people, drawing type is a lot about knowing how to erase. What I mean by that, is that you should be afraid of erasing, but should not erase so much, that you can't recognize the drawings anymore.   \n   \nAlthough some people might like them, I never used moulds(is that the right word). Try get a feeling for curves by drawing them by the hand. You don't have to be able to draw them in one stroke.   \nSometimes when I draw, I know from the beginning the curve I started to draw will be bad. You sometimes feel and see that strokes are under- or overstreched, or that it has the wrong character.   \n   \nWhat might help to understand the strokes, is to do a little bit of callygraphy.   \n   \nWhat john said is true. There are some very gut dutch books. For example: 'de theorie van de letter, by Gerrit Noordzij'. Where he is explaining his theory of type, based on calligraphy and writting.   \n   \nJacques\n\n"

      "content": "\"The Art of Hand Lettering\" (Helm Wotzkow/Dover) is a good, rather comprehensive book for hand-lettering, especially emphasizing proportion, spacing and color. Wotzkow also goes into some useful detail about the basic forms and structure of the various glyphs, even if getting a bit dogmatic about it.   \n   \nFor someone interested in creating hand-drawn faces, a good, comprehensive type specimen book is always useful (and fun to flip through for inspiration from time to time).   \n   \n\"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" (Jaspert, Berry & Johnson/Blandford) is a good (if flawed) one, among several others.   \n   \n\"Type: The Best in Digital Classic Text Fonts\" (Graphis) is a good specimen of 18 fonts that will probably all be seen somewhere on the \"favorite fonts\" lists due to be posted this coming weekend. It's probably more useful to digital typographers, but couldn't hurt for hand-letterers too.\n\n"
