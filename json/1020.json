We have not had a dinner party for two years now.   \n   \nI still keep an office in a building downtown, but only go there once or twice a week. I keep it because I don't have anywhere at home to store more than a small fraction of the library (the dining table is now surrounded by stacks of books related to current projects). The office looks like its been wrapped by Cristo: a couple of years back, a small fire elsewhere in the building caused sprinklers to go off on six floors, causing a huge amount of damage. My floor wasn't affected, but now I'm paranoid and have wrapped all my bookcases in heavy-duty plastic. If you want a book, you have to crawl under the plastic to retrieve it.   \n   \nI need to move to a bigger apartment, or a house, so I can set up a proper home-office and bring my books.   \n   \nIf all this sounds inconvenient and uncomfortable, it's not so bad, and I have an Aeron chair.
