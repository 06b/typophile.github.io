A place for contact information and resume uploading would be good too.\n\nAnything like that out there?\n\nIf you use the service, could you give me a review and remark if you like it or not.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ Tour de Ink](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122075007/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48325 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typolphile's Header Font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122075007/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48561 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But I’m not very adept at web developing and have to get something online ASAP so I can start hunting for a job. I figured an online portfolio service would meet my immediate needs to get something up and quickly.\n\nI’ve been interested in Behance, they have a nice site... I’ll look into that definitely!\n\n"
