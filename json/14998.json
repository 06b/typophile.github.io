I think Wolff Olins may well have done the brand...? See this report from 1997:  \n [http://www.morrisinquiry.gov.uk/downloads/evidence-inq-103.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20111219103159/http:/www.morrisinquiry.gov.uk/downloads/evidence-inq-103.pdf \"http://www.morrisinquiry.gov.uk/downloads/evidence-inq-103.pdf\")\n\nAlso on Wally Olins own biog website:  \n [http://wallyolins.com/biog.htm#](http://web.archive.org/web/20111219103159/http:/wallyolins.com/biog.htm# \"http://wallyolins.com/biog.htm#\")\n\nI think Yves is right: Tagline is a condensed version of Univers (not sure which weight without checking) but I have a feeling you want to know the Metropolitan Police font.\n\nThe stresses are oblique (see M and N). Notably, the P's are different top and bottom. Bottom P looks Myriad-ish but the rest isn't Myriad. I don't think I have ever seen an R with a tail like that.\n\n"
