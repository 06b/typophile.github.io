  "content": "Hi all\n\nI'm designing a biannual publication for a large conglomerate client. Their corporate ID uses Myriad and Clarendon - neither of which I have issue with, but for a magazine format which is about 'demonstrating what they're about' rather than 'selling what they're about'. I want something that hints at their corporate ID but is a bit more lifestyle and characterful.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks, as always.\n\n",

I've re-posted but in case here is what I'm doing:\n\nI'm designing a print publication for a large Indian conglomerate which is involved in heavy manufacturing, service industries and FMCG's. The title is to introduce their brand(s) to the European market, and will be akin to Monocle in it's ideology and breadth.\n\nI had in mind a font superfamily to bring harmony to the various strands of content and wanted something classic but fresh and contemporary and also future-proof.\n\nI have been looking at Freight, but the cost is prohibitive especially as I can't test the font in the design and present to the client.\n\nCan anyone suggest a similar hard-working family or any other thoughts/recommendations?\n\n"
