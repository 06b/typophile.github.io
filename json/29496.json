Any suggestions or hatred would be greatly appreciated.  \nCheers\n\nA quick overview. . . fakeshift identity for an upscale restaurant and private lounge in Walnut Creek, CA. Hard to sort of pin an indentity to a bar / lounge because most of the image can come from the interior decoration, but I wanted a mix of modern and elegant upscale.\n\nCheers\n\nJames\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Scriven\\_Wordmark\\_Final.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419054853/http:/typophile.com/files/Scriven_Wordmark_Final.pdf) | 253.13 KB |\n\n",

Just a couple of comments:\n\nThe '1' seems just a little too thick.\n\nAlso, I'd put another copy of \"Two Twelve\" on top of the mark, rotated 180 degrees to mirror the rotation of the last '2'.\n\nAs for the colours, I think the options with higher contrast work best (1,2,5,6), but I do dig the blue-grey in option 3.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

      "content": "i agree with Lex that the 1 seems too thick.\n\ni also think that'd be really cool to put TWO TWELVE above the mark, upside down. very neat idea, Lex.\n\nas for me though, i don't think the type choice works with the mark. to me they each speak a different style, and are not harmonizing. i'd rather see either a condensed serif or a thin sans-serif. and i'm leaning towards the sans-serif in my mind.\n\nor even a lowercase hand-drawn script could be nice. the 212 has an up-scale elegant look to it, and hand-drawn scripts usually represent that because it takes time to do. it's easy and cheap to just type out the words in Didot.\n\nfor color, i prefer the top left and bottom right. it's simple and the color works well. for multiple colors, i like the top right one; the low-contrast tan on tan and gray blue are very nice. i'm not digging the yellow/maroon combo at all, but i do like where it's trying to go - it seems different, unique, and that's just what bars want.\n\n"

I think either the Futura Condensed or the original (Bodoni?) look the best.\n\nI do like 2A, and these colours look nice. 2B is a little too \"Starbucks\" for my taste, and 2C looks upscale, but in a senior citizen sort of way.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
