Maybe you could cut the right \"descending\" serif and substitute it with something like the upper part of the six.   \n   \nThat would make a weird \"T\" anyway, but I think the whole font is special enouogh to tolerate it.   \n   \nI see the \"N\" too wide too.   \n   \nVicente   \nPS And a character representing Thai currency will make it funny...\n\n"
