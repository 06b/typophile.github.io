  "content": "So my computer crashed and had to completely start from scratch. My heart fell as soon as I went to reboot my computer and nothing but a setup assistant popped up. Soon nothing was working so I did a few reboots of the P RAM and eventually got tiger started on a complete reinstall, followed by Leopard and then trying to recover my files from “time machine”. I’ve lost all of my logo work that i’ve done in the last two weeks which is all for my job that I start in the next week, so I’m sad.\n\nHopefully I’ll have Adobe design suite installed soon and designing again!\n\nChris\n\n",
