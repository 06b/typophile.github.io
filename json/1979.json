  "content": "The American Nickel is having the back side of it being redesigned for release next year. It has two designs and I find one offensive. There is the boat Lewis and Clark used during their explorations (ho hum) but the other design that has a white person shaking the hand of an indian while the type mentions the Louisiana Purchase makes me gag. Wasn't after that purchase the first of the indian wars began where the US Government systematicly stold the lands of the Indians. Shake their hand and then imprision them for the riches of the west.\n\n",

      "content": "Well, OK, you asked for it.   \n   \nQuite frankly, I think the \"politically correct\" thought process demonstrates condescension towards those people whom the ethos ostensibly defends. It all boils down to some weird left-over Enlightenment duality idea that non-Westerners are some sort of receptacles for Western culture -- good or bad -- rather than being people with their own motivations and foibles.   \n   \nIf Native Americans want to object to the way they are depicted in American culture, rock on. I support their right to express their opinion. I may not necessarily share that opinion, or support their movement, but I support their right to speak up.   \n   \nWhat gets my goat is when people try to make political points by painting one group or another as being a victim. The Aztecs weren't victims, they were the meanest bastards on the continent. Native Americans weren't some special people. They were just people. Wanna-be social scientists concocting a myth of Native Americans as being some sort of noble savages is, in my opinion, a form of condescension.   \n   \nDo people complain about the Mongols murdering and raping their way through Europe and the Middle East? Or about the Franks conquering the Anglo Saxons? The Moors invading Iberia? No, because respect is involved. Two cultures meet. One is hungrier than the other, more desperate, more greedy, whatever. They fight. One wins.   \n   \nThe PC mindset doesn't allow for this. It elevates victimhood to be almost desirable. But in doing so it insults the people it supposedly defends.   \n   \nWhat I sensed in Dan's post was the knee-jerk, PC middle class Sociology 101 pissing and moaning that its practitioners think is showing respect for this other culture, but really is the exact opposite.   \n   \nAnd Steve, don't pretend for one second you have respect for my opinion. You have already labeled me blinkered, which is the same as ignorant. So -- because I have a different opinion than you, I'm ignorant?\n\n"

Its possible that you are indeed ignorant of the holes in your argument, but it actually appears as if you are aware of those holes, and too self righteous to care.   \n   \nYou ask: 'Do people complain about the Mongols murdering and raping their way through Europe and the Middle East? Or about the Franks conquering the Anglo Saxons? The Moors invading Iberia?'   \nWell I think you might hear a few complaints if the royal mint cast a new 2 quid piece depicting Harold losing the throne to William the Conqueror in a game of scrabble.   \n   \nYou also complain that 'people try to make political points by painting one group or another as being a victim'.   \nDoes this also count for the last 2 world wars, the holocaust, Vietnam, Uganda, Biafra, Rwanda, Somalia, Yugoslavia, Northern Ireland, Indonesia etc etc?   \nIs your answer to all of these: 'get over it'?\n\n"
