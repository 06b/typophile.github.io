The font files aren't distributed in any way, of course.\n\nHow about books and print design? If you're on Windows, can you use e.g. Arial (duh) in a print project without getting a commercial license?\n\nI've purchased all my fonts so far, but am just curious.\n\n",

They don't read EULAs because they don't probably even notice the licensing issue. This happens mostly because many web designers aren't that design-aware at all, and just mind about the technical issues.\n\nI've seen Windows computers that have everything from Baskerville to Bodoni (E+F) preinstalled in them, and people use them freely without regret. Be it personal or commercial work.\n\nAnd how about all those small companies that use all possible Arials and Verdanas (duh) in their ads and signage? How would they care about some fonts that came with the machine?\n\n"

Interestingly Microsoft is changing this with font specific section in the Windows Vista EULA…\n\n<cite>1 d. Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts (including software, metrics and data) to display and print content. You may only:<br>\n• Embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and<br>\n• Temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.<br>\n</cite>\n\n"

The only difference is in the minimum license (1 user versus 5 user).\n\nGiven the huge number of various licenses out there, I'm sure there's \\*somebody\\* whose license says you can't use the bundled fonts in work you get paid for.
