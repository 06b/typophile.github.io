I’m figuring the roman-lettering title font ought to reflect a French design aesthetic from that era, since that would probably have been the dominant design influence.\n\nBut which fonts? Vendôme? Or go for Choc/Mistral? Anything I’m not thinking of?\n\n",

There’s a lot of material on the site, but you should maybe search for Truffaut, Godard, Alain Resnais or Agnes Varda for the most iconic posters.\n\nWhen I think of French movie poster layouts of the time, I think of something like the Paris Match example Nick posted, with a similar typeface and the one-sided layout. Like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090927074109im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/truffaut_3845.jpg)\n\nBut Antique Olive seems to catch the feeling too, although I don’t think this is the original poster (I hope I ID’d the face correctly):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090927074109im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/a_bout_de_souffle_4324.jpg)\n\n"
