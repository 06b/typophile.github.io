Some alternatives: [Batak](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420023349/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/batak-condensed-itc), [Fairplex](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420023349/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/fairplex-ot), [Dickinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420023349/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/dickinson.php), [Vanilla Whale](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420023349/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/vanilla-whale) (probably the closest, needs to be squooshed and /R leg redrawn (from /P?))  \nYour best chance is probably to ask directly the designer. BTW, what's your sample origin?\n\n"
