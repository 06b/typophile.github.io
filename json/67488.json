For accuracy's sake, I would love to find an example of the lowercase or numbers.\n\nThe type has markings: AUDERBAUD BRESSURE (2 SEVRES)  \nAnyone have any insight on this or know what it means?\n\nIt would be nice to see if anyone has any other information on this particular font or the history of French wood type in general.  \nI know Clarendon was an English design, and this French one is a copy, but it is unique and I haven't seen one like it in all my years of type catalog absorbing.\n\nThanks,  \nMatt\n\n",

      "content": "Perhaps you have already found this reference, but a fine set of very French slab-serif wood letter capitals has just been sold by an English vendor on Ebay with exactly this marking. Googling should bring up the record, with a good image. ‘Bressure’ does not seem to be recorded as a place name, but it may be an alternative spelling for Bressuire, which is in the Département of Deux-Sèvres and has a municipal web site with various links, including one for the regional archives. They may be able to tell you if there was a wood-type maker there, ‘fabricant de caractères en bois’ or something of the kind. (That’s what I should call it. A ‘foundry’ made metal type, and there’s nothing wrong with extending the term to modern makers of digital fonts, but to me it sounds wrong to apply it to a manufacturer using a technique that was quite different from casting metal – although a few of the big typefoundries did make, or at least sell, wood types bearing their names.)\n\nI have tried the union catalogue of French libraries and can't find anything under ‘Auderbaud’ so perhaps nobody has kept their specimens. But I hope I'm wrong, and the municipal archives or library at Bressuire might be a place to start looking. Nor do I know of a study of the making wood type in France. If one doesn't exist, this may be the time to begin.\n\n"

      "content": "_Is it possible that the markings are Audebaud rather than Auderbaud and Bressuire rather than Bressure?_\n\nI agree that this might be the name – hadn't seen your post. But the reference in Ebay does also have ‘Auderbaud’ so presumably this was on the type. There are several Audebauds listed as authors in the French union catalogue, including one writing about a part of France that is not far away, so maybe it’s a regional name. But alas no type specimens under this name.\n\n"
