  "content": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if anyone could help us out on i.d'ing the masthead, blackletter-type font of this publication. I have no further information on the font, designers etc. Any help or close matches to this font would be greatly appreciated. I am a student who wants to use something similar in a project. (I am especially fond of the capitals, namely, the lovely 'P').\n\nMany Thanks,\n\nFaron G\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tumblr\\_mj3iddJtfc1r9chlco2\\_500.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016173200/http:/typophile.com/files/tumblr_mj3iddJtfc1r9chlco2_500.jpg) | 73.47 KB |\n\n",

There are quite a few elaborately ornamented blackletter faces (which look nothing like this one) - google for ornamented blackletter. Incidentally, the newspaper name is called the Nameplate. The masthead is the list, usually, inside, of the newspaper's owners, publishers, editors, and principal staff members. - Herb\n\n"
