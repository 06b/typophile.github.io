Can anyone think of a font that has this kinda g?  \nI'm not sure if my description is accurate someone else saw and described it to me!  \nSo if you guys can think of anything that's even remotely similar to the description above please let me know!\n\n",

One is [Jones](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019190357/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/jones/) from T-26; another is [Aitos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019190357/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=272992&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=19997&query=AITOS&SCOPE=Fonts), from Monotype; and the last I can think of is from Unifonts, and I would have to look for the name.  \n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

It's an odd feature but it was a little harder than I thought to find.  \nEvery Condensed has really nice letterforms and feel (regardless of the g). But the book version seems more like a titling and the regular like a book. Anyway I hope I'll find a way to use it for titles some day.\n\n"
