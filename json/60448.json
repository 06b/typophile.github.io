  "content": "So I was messing around in Illustrator today, and started going through some common fonts and writing down random phrases that I felt were in some way representative of each font’s “personality”. My subconscious was probably trying to weave the random phrases into a logical story, because they ended up loosely making sense. I thought it was kind of cool so I set each phrase in its respective font and took a screen shot to post.\n\nFeel free to add on and make a giant poem. Feel free to tell me that I should have better things to do. Feel free to say nothing. The only rule is that the phrase has to try to communicate something intangible about the font it wears.\n\nSorry about the bad kerning, I reached my limit for effort.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015011410im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture4_4236.png)\n\n",
