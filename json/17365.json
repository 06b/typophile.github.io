The org puts on tournaments, sponsors events and produceds a small amount of wearable gear for the disc golf market.\n\nThe target market stretches from 16 to 50(tenatively), so it's not so slanted toward one end of the consumeristic spectrum or the other. I will write more blah, blah, blah if I don't stop now.\n\nLet the judges critique.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [core.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415144137/http:/typophile.com/files/core.jpg) | 50.07 KB |\n| [core\\_new.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415144137/http:/typophile.com/files/core_new.gif) | 7.48 KB |\n\n",

Perhaps on the horizontal versions, the disc could sit where a superscript would for the word 'core', to show some flight and motion? The layouts feel a bit too static for the subject. The disc shows spin, but not as much flight.\n\n"

      "content": "So I finally got to updating based on some of the ideas. Chris, I know what you mean completely. It does feel static, though it should have motion since it is a quick/fast sport. I hope some of the examples give it what you think it needs.\n\nI definitely avoided using any extra elements to imply motion. It would distract immediately from the disc form if I did.\n\nAre the new samples better in your mind? I kind of dig the top row, second in from the left.\n\n"
