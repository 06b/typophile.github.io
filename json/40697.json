  "content": "I’m currently working on a pretty dry piece of material, a bland technical document where the author uses a lot of bullet points, and stepped indenture, and outlined lists (I.A.1.a...).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is there a standardized rule of thumb when it comes to indents? Perhaps a formula has been devised that I’m not aware of. I’m currently using a 2 step, but have had 3 step in the past.\n\nFirst Step: Left Indent .1806, First Line Indent -.1325 Bullet Tab .1806  \nSecond Step: Left Indent .313, First Line Indent -.1000 Bullet Tab .313  \nThird Step: Left Indent .4455, First Line Indent -.1399 Bullet Tab .4455\n\nClearly there isn’t a consistency between these indents, I’ve just eyeballed using the tab toolbar.\n\n2. When setting up outlined lists, what’s the standard flow? Is it I.A.1.a. or something different? I remember creating outlines in 7th grade English class, but I don’t remember what the format was anymore.\n\n3. Finally, when doing bulleted lists and when those lists are indented, should I continue to use the same bullets for the indentures? Or should I change bullet styles (color, character, size)? I like the look of the sideways carrot\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008043319im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Sideways%20Carrot_5451.jpg)\n and tend to use the standard bullet • for second step indentures.\n\nI hope these questions aren’t too confusing. I don’t have The Elements of Typographic Style available which I imagine would have these answers. Any help will be very appreciated.\n\n\\*Edit: Attached KittyHawk.PDF. It’s still in draft form, so some of the comments aren’t complete and I’m still formatting the images. I’d be interested to hear thoughts on the design.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [KittyHawk.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008043319/http:/typophile.com/files/KittyHawk.pdf) | 307.48 KB |\n| [KittyHawkB.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008043319/http:/typophile.com/files/KittyHawkB.pdf) | 269.81 KB |\n| [PDR USS Bonhomme Richard LHD 6r.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008043319/http:/typophile.com/files/PDR%20USS%20Bonhomme%20Richard%20LHD%206r.pdf) | 216.7 KB |\n\n [‹ Vag Rounded Alternatives](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008043319/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41313 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typowiki How-To Oblique Article? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008043319/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40680 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Find a copy of the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual instead.\n\n_1. Is there a standardized rule of thumb when it comes to indents?_\n\nDepending on the face and the size of the page I’m using, I like two or three ems — depends how far down you have to go.\n\n_2. When setting up outlined lists, what’s the standard flow? Is it I.A.1.a. or something different? I remember creating outlines in 7th grade English class, but I don’t remember what the format was anymore._\n\nGiven the topic, I’d follow GPO style as closely as possible, so you’d have 1, 1.1, 1.1 a, 1.1 a (i). That being said, I did work at Treasury that went I.A.1.a.(i) — just pick one and stick to it.\n\n_3. Finally, when doing bulleted lists and when those lists are indented, should I continue to use the same bullets for the indentures? Or should I change bullet styles (color, character, size)?_\n\nI don’t mind how you’ve used the coloured carrot in the sample at all, particularly how tight this is set. It really could use for some extra space (or a 1-em indent) between paragraphs where there’s really not a lot of indication where one starts and the next begins.\n\nA couple of other things — line up your tables with the left column flush left and anything with numbers either on a decimal tab or flush right. Centering makes them a witch to read. ;-)\n\nAnd is there any chance of giving the text a loosening-up? Man, you’ve really got it squished on the page!\n\n"

The content is collected from paraphrasing a much larger and in-depth report. It’s like a summary of the deployment focusing on specific areas hence the orange header bars. However, I do agree, I think the bullets are abit much sometime, especially when there are multiple levels.\n\nEverything is tight to get it into as small a document as possible. This document is actually the longest I’ve ever created for one of these PDRs, and it’s because of the information on page 5, I’ve never had to include a table like that before. Most of the time I can create a nice 2 sided tabloid.\n\n"

If there’s any chance you could use it, do so, since the paper cost will be the same and the look much nicer. Bump the text to 10pt and the leading to 12 (or more, if you can), and add some extra space before major headings.\n\n(Looking at this reminds me of a couple of subcontracts I did in DC for Beltway Bandits: ah, those were the days....) :-P\n\n"

The content was minimal and the images weren’t especially great. I don’t expect to many of these PDRs to be like this, but for the amount of information I think it works well.\n\n"
