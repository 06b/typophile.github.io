      "content": "This looks nice! I'm so into that swash on the d.  \nThe first thing I notice is how straight and mechanical the underlines are. They are perfect and flat while the type is flowing and slants up a little (look at the space below the rs).  \nThe two minor things I also notice are the fine line on the stem of the L looks a little thick and not quite right yet. And the bottom of the d, where the stem turns into the tail, looks a little heavy. It might be nice to play with making the thin upstroke of the bowl build into the stem.  \nNice work.\n\n"
