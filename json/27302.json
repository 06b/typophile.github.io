If I were a betting man, I would guess it wouldn’t - legitimately purchased fonts would/should not have such licensing restrictions.\n\nBut these 2 fonts are apparently the same, as per original opinion?\n\nYes, the simple solution is to purchase the font. However, I must justify such actions for the beancounters, and ensure my course of action will actually be succesful.\n\n(Question: Not being a font author, does the Macromedia Fontographer? footprint suggest someone has modified the original Linotype Zapfino, and in the process caused this error.)\n\nThanks again for the help\n\n"
