However, I called FontShop per Kimera's instructions and they said they no longer work with Kimera. I sent an email to Kimera and no one responded. Kimera appears to have dropped off the face of the earth post 2006.\n\nI am impressed with some of the work I see and I would love to buy Darka at the very least! Can anyone help?\n\nSincere thanks,\n\nKeith\n\n",

      "content": "Thank you, Guys!\n\nI have avoided dialing the number in part because of the long distance cost, but perhaps that will be my only option now. (AT&T can have some really punitive rates at times.) I confess I am also a bit hesitant giving my information over the phone. (And Visa will charge me an additional fee for an out-of-country purchase.) Still, I suspect Kimera is most likely a very reputable company (if it still exists!).\n\nIn fact, I've been tempted to make a second post on purchases and trust. How does one know the reputable type companies. Clearly Adobe, LInotype, and generally I would assume companies recommended on this site….\n\nkentlew, thank you for Will's name. I sent him an email asking if he was still in contact with Gabriel. Fingers crossed!\n\nI'm certainly open to suggestions, because as Stephen notes, this is a really lovely blackletter. I love this man's work: it pays honor to the past while brining it into the present.\n\nKeith  \nFabricando fabri fimus.\n\n"

Hope it will be the norm in the near future.)\n\n"
