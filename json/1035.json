It was one of their   \nearliest releases and you can kinda tell.   \n   \nThe [Bitstream version](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017231122/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/) is pretty good, especially for text.   \nThere is also [the new one from Neufville Digital](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017231122/http:/www.neufville.com/uk/startfuk.htm) which looks   \nvery good and has lots of extras like small caps and old   \nstyle numerals. Also, it has CE, Turkish and Baltic language   \nsupport.   \n   \nOne thing that I miss from the pre-digital days are the   \ndisplay cuts of Futura. All the available digital versions   \nseem to be based on the text sizes (except, I remember   \nImage Club did display versions, I don't know if those are   \nstill available). The text cuts--even good ones--look a bit   \nclumsy at display sizes.\n\n"
