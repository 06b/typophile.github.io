For the project, we are to gather some data and design a positive piece that exhibits our findings.\n\nFor my project, I’ve chosen postcards! I am really excited about the project. In order to gather some data, I’ve built a website. Check it out at:\n\n[www.onepostcard.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090517053043/http:/www.onepostcard.com/ \"www.onepostcard.com\")\n\nIf everyone would be so kind as to take the survey and to upload some postcards.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
