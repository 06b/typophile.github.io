  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nHere’s another font ID someone sent me that has me stumped. It reminds me of Bil’ak’s ’Fedra’, or something by Luc(as) de Groot, or a little bit of Mark Jamra’s ’Kinesis italic’, but I have had no luck finding it. The ’f’ and ’g’ and the triangular serifs seem like obvious earmarks.\n\nThanks for your help,  \n- Mike\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [hypotheken.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218185150/http:/typophile.com/files/hypotheken.gif) | 4.83 KB |\n\n [‹ Carol Twombly Typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218185150/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31669 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [straight-sided compact sans used on Spice Girls logo and record labels ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218185150/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31682 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I have just finished hunting through the book ’Dutch Type’ and a weird theory is forming in my mind. This looks like a slightly backslanted, and widened/flattened modification that started with [Fedra Serif A Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218185150/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheque/fedra-serif-a/medium-italic/charmap.html).\n\nLet me explain my reasons, even though this will seem really funny if someone finds the font. Fedra has very distinctive foot serifs on its italic face, and they match this sample. It looks like the same serifs have been copied and pasted on the top of stems, like the p and m. A base serif was also added to the p. The triangular serifs on the ascenders might also be add-ons. Notice also that the ’s’ and ’c’, as well as a number of other letters, are very much like Fedra Serif Italic letters. The biggest mismatches in this theory seem to be the ’f’, ’g’ and ’y’, but I can see using the tail of the true ’g’ to make the ends of the ’f’ and the new ’y’ (made with a ’u’). The only re-drawn feature might be the tail on the new ’g’.\n\nIf I had the font I could try this, but does anyone think this seems plausible? Or am I just seeing things, after looking at too many type samples?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
