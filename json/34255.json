I was part of a team that was charged with redesigning Betty Crocker cookbooks to make them more upscale - this was in the mid/late 80s. We trained the photographers, reworked all the designs, individualized them, etc. Upshot was they didn’t sell as well and so Betty reverted back to their more generic midmarket look. This was before Martha Stewart Living & Real Simple hit the scene; I think the public appetite (so to speak) for more elegant cookbook design has improved since then.\n\n"

It was a pretty cool exhibit. Some of the work never made it for very obvious reasons, and some of it was actually very very good, but still “failed.”\n\n"

And there are some baaaaddd ones out there, like Wrigleys gum. But I don’t know if it affected sales, and that’s what defines a design’s success, innit? And there will always be some public resistance to change.\n\nThe Saks Fifth Avenue Optima-esque logo did nothing for me and now they are back to a redraw of their original script logo.\n\nOr do you just want to focus on designs that designers dislike?\n\nI loathe the Verizon logo - as do most designers I know, for example, but that doesn’t seem to be a problem for them.\n\nAnother interesting one, the triangle on the Morgan Stanley logo that Landor got paid umpteen millions to design - and now it’s gone.\n\nOr... a friend is rebranding Marriott. I told him I liked the M in the circle and he told me it’s considered to be ineffective and they’re dropping it.\n\nNone of these qualify as either risky or shocking tho.\n\n"

But I don’t know about your “big risk” here - the designers did get paid.\n\nIn type design it’s hard to see “big risk” being a factor, since you already know you’re not really going to be rich even if your work is successful! You put an inadvisable amount of hours into it either way. :-/\n\nMaybe you could say Cassandre took big risks with the way he made fonts, like Peignot (which was actually intended as an attempt to reform the Latin alphabet). When these risks didn’t pay off, he killed himself.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Warner was using an insane contract he signed in the late 1970s to force him to put out everything but the music he really wanted to. He was so pissed at Warner that he used a contract loophole to force them to market all of his material under the symbol instead of his name, causing his album sales to tank.\n\n"

Not so much a failed campaign as an awkward way to deal with legal restrictions. Not to mention typographically limiting. Though, for a while there, you could download a font with that symbol in it.\n\nIn the case of the soda, and other mass-market items, the very dynamics of competition make all the difference.
