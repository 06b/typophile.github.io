It seems like it would be a nice addition to my collection.\n\nI’ve heard good things about DTL Documenta, however. This one looks very usable.\n\n [‹ Creating a lowercase form that matches an uppercase's x-height and stroke width](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009063216/http:/typophile.com/node/15250 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typophile site (forum) font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009063216/http:/typophile.com/node/15247 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Romulus is one of the most beautiful types ever designed. Its slanted Roman, in place of italic, is not a success though. DTL doesn’t seem to have plans to do van Krimpen’s Chanceleresca Bastarda, the great script companion to Romulus.\n\nIn spite of their great beauty, van Krimpen’s faces always seem to have suffered from some flaw that prevented their wide use.\n\nPerhaps DTL will make a usable version. I hope so. But I don’t believe it has been released. It has been promised for many years; now it looks like they do have a lot of it completed, but I have no idea when they will release it.\n\nFor a type that breathes Van Krimpen’s spirit, but does it with it seems more usefulness than Van Krimpen himself, it seems, see the magnificant (and unbelievably expensive) [Trinite](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009063216/http:/www.teff.nl/fonts/trinite/trinite.html).\n\n"

And discusses it at length. Both books should be available through the Dutch book seller Nijhof & Lee, which has a web site, and elsewhere that I forget.  \nI worked at Autologic in the early ’80s when it’s Swiss subsidiary Bobst Graphic released Trinite for photosetting. The promotional booklet is a treasure. The cover is shown on pg 160 of Middendorp’s book. I’m so happy I have these books and the booklet!  \nBased on what I’ve read in the above books, I think Trinite had significant use in the Netherlands in the ’80s.  \nI’d buy and use it in a minute if it was affordable!  \nBrian\n\n"
