The query got emailed around the office, but no one knew what it was although a few people took an early lunch that day...\n\nIt caught my eye because it has a really pointy W but a slope and slightly calligraphic feel to some of the characters.\n\nThanks!  \nFG\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091004032024im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/fontID_burger_4744.jpg)\n\n",
