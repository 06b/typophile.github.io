      "content": "Hi Mandelbort,  \nwelcome to Typophile.\n\nHere’s a list of script typefaces. I’m not saying that they are particularly similar to your sample, because that heavily depends on whether you want to emulate the overall appearance, whether you’re looking for the same writing tool or for certain letterforms. Scripts are quite unique.\n\n[Brush Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Brush+Script&site=d&sample_text=Padres&sample_size=96) is an old fart. [Mark Simonson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mark%20Simonson)’s [Kinescope](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/mark_simonson/kinescope/?sample_text=Padres&sample_size=144) is a lot nicer. So is [Tomas Brousil](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Tomas%20Brousil)’s [Bistro Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/suitcase/bistroscript_regular/?sample_text=Padres&sample_size=144). [La Salle](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/la_salle_regular_ot/?sample_text=Padres&sample_size=144).\n\nThere’s [Las Vegas Fabulous](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=27) by [House Industries](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/typophile.com/wiki/House%20Industries). Their [Sable](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.tdc.org/news/2008Results/Sable.html) wil be released soon.  \nLetterheadfonts have several script fonts, American style, too: [Ball Park](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ballparkscript.shtml), [Marie](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/mariescript.shtml), [Cosmic Cursive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/cosmiccursive.shtml). And FontBros offer [Metroscript](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=ALSO-MESR), [Parsley Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=BLVI-PASC) and [Coffee Service](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=SIDE-COSE), among others.  \nTwo more essential addresses for nice retro and not-so-retro script fonts: [Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.sudtipos.com/) and [Fontdiner](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310032417/http:/www.fontdiner.com/).  \nF\n\n"
