But then the effect disappears in other point sizes. The screenshot below shows you what I'm talking about. The letters in black are how they should be, but the ones in pink show the errors. And the funny thing is it all corrects itself if I convert the text to paths.\n\nI'm wondering if this is a hinting problem with the font, and if it's possible to correct something like this in a free program like Fontforge?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120110102244im_/http:/typophile.com/files/rocko_4566.png)\n\n",

After installing the Adobe FDK for OpenType from [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120110102244/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/ \"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\") just type in Terminal/commandline the two lines one by one:\n\n`makeotf -f RockoFLF.ttf\nautohint -nb RockoFLF.otf`\n\nand use the final RockoFLF.otf. The PostScript hinting model used in OpenType PS fonts tend to be more robust and less prone to \"strange errors\" caused by automatic hinting.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"
