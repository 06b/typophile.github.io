  "content": "Has anyone ever experienced a vertical shift in the alignement of fonts when documents are ported from Mac to Win, or vice versa? I am referring to Quark 4.1 and 5. This of course only happens if the top is aligned with the box. It does not happen with fonts that are set to baseline grid. What I am seeing is that on Win the fonts are aligned at cap height, whilst on Mac they are set on ascender.   \nIt has nothing to do with the alignement info since that only affects fonts that are actually part of the Quark font database.   \n   \nBruno Maag   \nDalton Maag Ltd\n\n",
