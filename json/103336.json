It looks very much like Futura but I don't think it is, as the width of the bars isn't consistent.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018224409im_/http:/typophile.com/files/400x150_5986.png)\n\nYour help identifying this would be much appreciated\n\n",

So I might suggest that you cross reference your installed list with the Identifont suggestions and see if one of them fits.  \nDon\n\n"
