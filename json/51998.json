      "content": "\"angry young computer\" seems to be a grotesque. The 1985 Phil's Photo \"Homage to the Alphabet\" book shows something called California Grotesque which is similar in feel, but not the details of the descenders (the g is the wrong kind, and the y tail isn't as upturned). [Grotesque No.9](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024060705/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/grotesque-no-9/) shows some of these features, but the weight isn't right. [Fielder Gothic Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024060705/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atfiedler-gothic-bold/) shows one surviving member of what was a large family with varying widths and details in the days of phototypes.\n\nIn the 60's phototypes were widely used, and gothics/grotesques came in every imaginable variation or weight, widths and letterform feature (r curve, g tail, a tail, y tail, c closure). That means that finding the same typeface in digital font format is probably unlikely. You can search using grotesque or gothic condensed and find many of today's equivalent styles.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "It looks like Square Grotesk, a display phototype family by Techni-Process of New York from the 1960s. My understanding is that California Grotesk was a derivative. The alternate l/c \"g\" looks to be a custom variation, I would have to pull the original film out of storage to check. Not digitized.\n\nHere's a page from the specimen book\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024060705im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SquareGrotesk50series_6269.jpg)\n\nThe Burroughs Corporation mark looks custom drawn.\n\n"
