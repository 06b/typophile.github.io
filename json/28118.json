  "content": "Based on an idea by master printer Gerald Lange, The MicroFoundry  \nhas designed and arranged for the manufacture of a unique piece of  \nspecial-interest furniture: the TypeTable.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424013046im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1s_4623.jpg)\n\nEssentially a glass-top coffee table that gracefully accommodates a drawer  \nof letterpress type, the TypeTable nicely exhibits an instance of high craft  \nfor discernment by the typographic aficionado, and is itself crafted to high  \nstandards: sturdy but elegant construction, to a tolerance of 1/32 of an inch;  \n1/2-inch beveled glass; and easy movement of the type drawer into and out  \nof the framework, ensuring that the font is not converted into a \"museum  \npiece\" but instead remains a dignified, usable resource. <cite>Note that the purchase<br>\nof the TypeTable does not include a drawer of type; this must be provided by<br>\nthe customer, although The MicroFoundry would gladly help in procuring a drawer.</cite>\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424013046im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2s_5146.jpg)\n\nWith the drawer of type removed, the table reveals its attractive lattice  \nmidboard, which can be used to exhibit other items (up to 1-1/2 inches in  \nheight) making this piece of \"typographic furniture\" highly versatile.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424013046im_/http:/typophile.com/files/7s_4870.jpg)\n\nThe TypeTable has dimensions of 36×18×18 inches, and is offered for sale at  \nUS$555 (plus delivery costs). It is manufactured on a first-come, first-served  \nbasis. Please direct all inquiries (including interest in tables that accommodate  \nmore than one drawer) to Hrant Papazian: hpapazian\\_at\\_gmail\\_dot\\_com\n\n",

Did you get my email?\n\n--\n\nSo Michael, still sore about the Palatino broadside debacle? ;-)\n\nActually at my parents' house there's a typecase on a wall full of Dungeons & Dragons miniatures that I painted over my teen years. In fact now that I think about it (not to mention that I actually know what a California job case is and looks like) it must have been a typecase for Arabic type - it has a lot of smaller compartments instead of many really small and really large ones.\n\nhhp\n\n"

(i'm thinking hard about it. i know i had done a broadside in 54pt a lonnng time ago. rebacle it for me?)\n\nyour folk's case could have been any number of arrangements. all-cap cases have equal sized compartments. of course i suppose it depends on where it came from.\n\nanyway, it IS a handsome table, however, you see what happens when you remove cases from their native environment/raison d'etre. the price becomes obscene. i'm still astounded. the most i had ever heard was $35, and i actually thought that was a phase that had been passed through. apparently not.\n\nmjb\n\n"

      "content": "Actually if you don't recall then you must be over it!  \nAnyway, it wasn't a big deal. Plus I was actually on your side.\n\nMy parents' case, originally a gift to me from my brother's mother-in-law-to-be, is from/in Lebanon, and did have variance in compartment size, but it seems to me not as much as the letter frequencies of Latinate scripts would require. I'm guessing it was for Arabic type because Arabic has four cases per letter (for most of its letters) and that \"flattens\" the required sort frequencies - but it's just a guess.\n\n\\> however, you see what happens when you remove  \n\\> cases from their native environment/raison d’etre.\n\nYes, and more than the valuation issue of the case I mind that the <cite>font</cite> could be affected negatively: it might become sort of a circus act, losing its dignified standing as a useful thing. BUT that really depends on the customer/user - sort of like how a kitchen knife could be used to cook or kill.\n\nThe fact that I agree with you on this to some extent is why:  \n1) It was very important to me to make the case as easy to pull out as it would be from a typecase stand/cabinet. Ideally I see this table being placed inside a printing studio/shop, although for people -like me- who own a metal (or wood!) font but not a press, or maybe own a font so valuable (to them) that they actually avoid using it for fear of wear, I think it can still house the font in a way that maintains dignity. Again, it depends on the customer: he can choose to see/show the font as a freak, or as a living tool.  \n2) I decided not to include a case or type with the table (although like I've said I can help the customer locate either or both).\n\nhhp\n\n"
