  "content": "Hi,\n\nI was wondering if fellow Typophiles could recommend a typeface that would go with the image below and keywords like: culture & cross-cultural, diversity, education, social, playful, universal. I'd like it to be rather bold, mainly for display purposes - titles, headings and shorter texts but a body text weight for longer descriptions would be nice too.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120717081329im_/http:/typophile.com/files/forum-logo_6512.jpg)\n\nThank you.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nAleksander  \n [www.culturepicture.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120717081329/http:/www.culturepicture.com/ \"www.culturepicture.com\")\n\n",
