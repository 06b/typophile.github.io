  "content": "I know that the encoding of stylistic glyph variants with unicode PUA code points is frowned upon, and all of our commercial OT fonts contain no PUA encoding. But many of our customers are sign makers, and sign making software is generally not OT savvy. The only way for these clients to access stylistic glyphs, is via Windows Character Map, and that requires a glyph to have a unicode codepoint. Is there any \"best practice\" as to using PUA that will allow this?\n\nJames\n\n",

But it's a good idea to use an internal (private) \"standard\".\n\n"

But if you are working in the relevant genre, such as [constructed/artificial scripts](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723090103/http:/www.evertype.com/standards/csur/) or [medieval research](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723090103/http:/www.mufi.info/) it might be helpful to follow those guidelines. This probably isn't much of an issue for the sign making market, but there it is.\n\n"

If I'm creating a font for the scholarly/philologist with publications of oldmanuscripts in mind, I'd use MUFI recommendations.  \nThen again, you'd do that only on commission, so you'd know what to use.\n\nAnd as Jason pointed it out, this one is of no concern to your clients.\n\n"
