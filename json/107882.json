It seems there is no glyph palette, i can view all the available glyphs in the Mac 'character viewer' but when i go to select a glyph to insert such as an underline it just says - \"The application you are currently using doesn't support glyph variants.\"\n\nAny work arounds?\n\n",

You can get the characters (Unicode) from InDesign to Photoshop, but at least in CS6 glyph variant information is still NOT preserved from InDesign to Photoshop (I just tried it again), but IS preserved from Illustrator to Photoshop.\n\nWhat does this mean? If you have an ornament that is encoded as an alternate of the bullet, but has no unique Unicode of its own, you can copy-paste it from Illustrator to Photoshop and get the desired ornament, but going from InDesign to Photoshop will revert it to a plain bullet. Similarly other OpenType-specific formatting.\n\n"

In most cases you wouldn't know that unless you ask the font designer before purchasing it. That's why a lot of people find it easier to set type in Illustrator and paste it into Photoshop.\n\n"
