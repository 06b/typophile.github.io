  "content": "Hi guys, new here at typophile but used to come every now and then to read posts. I decided to finally get an account. My first question on the forum is:\n\nwhat is the difference between a [solidus](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202143729/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/solidus) and a [virgule](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202143729/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/virgule)?\n\nI believe a solidus is a fraction mark and a virgule is the plain old slash, is this correct? Thanks.\n\nBrian\n\n [‹ Does anyone have any tips on how to improve your handwriting?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202143729/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29149 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Trademarked athletic logos (or: Why your \"W\" looks too much like my \"W\") ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202143729/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29225 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "True solidus from Roman.\n\nEngland has it because the Romans came here and ’/’ is a shilling. // two slashes with a bar through it is a libra, a measure of weight or curreny (looks similar to # that the americans call ’pound sign’). Hence the £ is the current form of the ’pound sterling’.\n\nAnd in typography the stacked fractions were called ’nut’ fractions since they were often on the ’nut’ or ’en space’ and the lining ones often called ’shilling fractions’.\n\n"
