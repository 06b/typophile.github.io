Cause it seems a bit hard to read when you set the text sample above, though it is a display font. Like the 'L I' that can be misreading to 'U'. Well that's it for this time. I'll make more suggestions next time. I'll just wait for the other to critique. Great! Keep up the good work!   \n   \n+ep+\n\n"

The strong grid constraint seems to be getting you in the case of some letters, and this type of thing has been done before, but maybe not as tastefully. I think this design will be popular - you might even make some money from it!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
