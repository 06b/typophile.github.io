If I wanted to increase the size of the long text, to give it more of a presence, and look less boring, say somewhere between 14-18 pts--is either a better option for that?\n\nCould a medium weight at, I don't know, 14 point, accomplish what I might want a regular weight to do at 16? (which is to say, give more of a presence, but still come across as a weight meant for text)\n\n",

Otherwise, instead of more presence you could risk to give less legibility.</cite>\n\nI think you are assuming way too much here.\n\nOne should choose a medium over a regular or book weigh if the typographic color of the medium is more appropriate for the job.\n\nSome mediums are bolder than others. Test the medium you are thinking about using against the regular. Which one do you like better? Which one has better color? Use that one!\n\n"
