  "content": "It's my first post, so hello everyone.  \nI would like to know your opinion about this logo, which I created for publishing company called WiR. It's completely imaginary company which produces books and e-books in two languages. My idea is that they have a special method where text flow from one language to the other. That's why I tried to connect all 3 letters. \"W\" and \"R\" are first letters of founders surnames and \"i\" is \"and\" in my language. What do you think?  \n[logoWir.png]\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logoWir.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419173425/http:/typophile.com/files/logoWir.png) | 30.94 KB |\n\n",

It was awkward in some layouts, and when reduced small the type was hard to read.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419173425im_/http:/typophile.com/files/small-logo_6282.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419173425im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-small-100_6444.jpg)\n\n"
