      "content": "This is my first test balloon. I am working on a manuscript written in German and Italian language (though for the second one I will need help).  \nIt treats about designing my typefaces not meant for daily use in rough publishing or commercial area. In a sense they are artistic researches on the symbolic search for female beauty.  \nI inspire myself with photographers as Paolo Roversi or recently I go back to Renaissance painters.  \nThe manuscript shall as well contain technical aspects as also poetic views on my everyday wondering of what is beauty all about.  \nI love to express myself with the letters of the alphabet.  \nAnd for the future I hope that someone will enjoy this ride with me through thoughts, feeling and shape.  \nI am working on it.\n\nThanks  \nStefan\n\n"
