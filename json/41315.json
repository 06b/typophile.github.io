      "content": "Wow! (scratches head) These letters don’t seem so unusual, but taken altogether I am having a heck of a time matching them. The features I was trying to spot were the geometric curve of the counters, the open-ness of the C, the legs of the R and K. Even if this is the condensed member of a larger family, some of those attributes should be in the parent font, but unless i just went letter-blind, I couldn’t see it. The closest selections I could find at MyFonts — which I thought gave me good odds of finding it — were [Mighty Tuxedo AOE](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192557/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/mighty-tuxedo-aoe/), [PTL Golary Red Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192557/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/golary-red/) and [Trivet Solid](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192557/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/elemeno/trivet/solid/). None of these is an exact match, and squooshing and faux SC tricks would help, but still not be identical, I think.\n\nConclusions: I don’t think it’s sold at MyFonts; this proves why I love doing this — how else could someone be so entertained looking for such mundane letters?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
