  "content": "Hello. I'm working on a pretty simple MT based site for a non-profit friend & client and want to incorporate a 3-level 'suckerfish' dropdown menu in the sidebar, for navigation to the various sections, subsections & some individual articles on the site.\n\nI've got the code, but need a bit of help to make it work correctly and look pretty. I will of course be happy to pay someone to help me, plus will buy drinks at Typecon.\n\nAnyone interested?\n\nJLT \\> [hundertwasser@yahoo.com](mailto:hundertwasser@yahoo.com)\n\n",
