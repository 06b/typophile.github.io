  "content": "hey people.  \ni made a small movie clip,  \ncalling for a moment of silence,  \ndedicated to the dual casualties of the  \ncurrent war between israel and palestine.\n\ni created the calligraphy based on the \"wilhelm klingspor gotisch\" font,  \nwith my own hebrewed version to it, adding slight hebrew serifs called \"Okatsim\".  \ni used a red calligraphy ink (\"Winsor & Newton\") on a smooth surface paper (although the movie has low quality, so the nuances are lost).\n\ni would be glad to show better resolution scans of the calligraphy if you want to.\n\nlink: [link to the movieclip.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020173102/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/yaronimus/3158371740/)\n\n",
