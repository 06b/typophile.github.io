I'm watching quite a few things, trying to make sure that specifying fonts in CSS works as well as possible, with an eye to the day when one might be able to use a much wider variety of fonts (web fonts).\n\nBasically CSS only allows a font family to have nine distinct weights (like the original Apple TrueType spec, I think). Folks at the W3C are questioning the need for allowing more than nine weights in a font family.\n\nBut Microsoft changed that scale (pre-OpenType, in their TrueType spec, in the OS/2 table) by multiplying it by 100, and the only plausible reason for that would seem to be to allow finer gradations of weight.\n\nI think I'm coming to the realization that this is just another of the many compromises made in CSS font handling. Only a few families would be affected by this one. I suspect it would have to be much more badly broken for the W3C to consider changing it... I'll probably go find some other CSS fonts windmill to tilt at.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
