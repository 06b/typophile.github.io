These will be published in PDF format for both on-screen reading and printing off the web. The audience will be physicians.\n\nI’m looking for ideas for fonts for the main body of text as well as headers, titles, etc. There should be a certain gravitas to the results, so I’m looking for thoughts on font combinations as much as individual recommendations.\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ dadaism to sans serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20070716090149/http:/typophile.com/node/30008 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Futura lookalike ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070716090149/http:/typophile.com/node/30014 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
