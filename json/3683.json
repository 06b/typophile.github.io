I hadn't looked closely at the album title, which did have obviously repeating letters, but the designer did distress her name enough so that the letters didn't repeat exactly (on the ad I have, which is a little different than the sample above). So I guess I'll give the designer moderate props for fooling me. That's what I think a designer should do with a handwriting font for a logo such as this.   \n   \nGood call, Yves.\n\n"
