A full branding solution for Bravo AV.   \nClient needed everything from naming, type design, logo, full collateral, signage, exterior revamped architectural detailing, etc..   \nAt this stage we are fine tuning the type design and logo. A previous client Musa Design (Musadesign.net) is doing the exterior with my collaboration.   \nIn my first posting I am showing Type design.   \n   \n ![Bravo / Unicratica modified](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013052729im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26318.jpg)\n\n",
