I was surprised it is available for free. Or would it be considered as lacking authenticity, being an interpretation of the \"real\" fonts?\n\n",

TeX Gyre Adventor is based on the URW Gothic L kindly released by URW++ Design and Development Inc. under GFL (independently of the GPL release accompanying Ghostscript). The Vietnamese glyphs were added by Han The Thanh. The Greek (basic) alphabet programmed for the TeX Gyre Adventor was inspired by the Kerkis package ( [http://iris.math.aegean.gr/kerkis/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110013/http:/iris.math.aegean.gr/kerkis/)).\n> \n> TeX Gyre Adventor can be used as a replacement for ITC Avant Garde Gothic (designed by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnase, 1970).\n"
