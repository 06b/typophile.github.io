But as the product positions itself as being innovative but relatively neutral to some of the trends in technology advertising, I'm attempting to introduce Clarendon into the picture.   \n   \nHere's a sample spread with Avenir for the headline, somewhat Apple-esque and relatively \"safe\":   \n [http://www.cameronmoll.com/misc/foldout1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525002036/http:/www.cameronmoll.com/misc/foldout1.gif)   \n   \nNow here's the same piece with Clarendon, a bit shy of the norm and somewhat daring:   \n [http://www.cameronmoll.com/misc/foldout2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525002036/http:/www.cameronmoll.com/misc/foldout2.gif)   \n   \nDoes the Clarendon headline fly? Or is it too daring? Feedback appreciated.   \n   \n(If you'd prefer to see other pages to get a better feel, lemme know.)\n\n",
