Usually when I try to use some kind of webdings-style font in PS I can’t access the characters displayed in the font preview in (I use a mac) fontbook. I’ve been told these are “pi” fonts or something and that I can use the International palette thingy to use these fonts but the ones I want don’t show up in the list. Can someone please help me here?\n\n [‹ MacBook and FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224214311/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34965 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New National Geographic ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224214311/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14848 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
