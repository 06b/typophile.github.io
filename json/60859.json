  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm designing a book in which the chapter titles are presented in spreads. While some of the titles are fairly easy to lay out, some are a bit trickier - see attached. I need tips on how much allowance I should give the letters in the gutter, and if I should create separate text boxes for each page rather than one across the entire spread (if this lessens headaches with the printer down the road).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017143556/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_280.png) | 68.7 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "- How is the book being bound? Leave 7-10 mm for perfect binding, 5+ mm if it is Smyth sewn, and minimal extra space if it is saddle stitched. (If it's a mechanical binding, like wire-o or spiral, I recommend you change the design so display lines don't straddle the gutter.)\n- Don't split a letter across a spread. If possible, don't split a word across a spread. Using two separate text boxes will probably make this easier.\n- Book binding is an industrial process, and facing pages can only be made to align within certain tolerances. As you move forward with this design, bear in mind that on some copies of the book, the baseline alignment on facing pages will be off by a couple of mm.\n\n"

      "content": "It is actually possible to bind sheets into books so that they open out completely flat--the device used is like two very narrow pages that are glued together with the insert in the middle, but only part way, at the edge. So the effect is a \"stalk\" or \"Y\" shape that flattens to a \"T\".\n\nNot really relevant here. Especially good for maps.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the tips.\n\nI've budgeted for hardcover binding with the broker (still have to specify for double fan adhesive), but there may be room to revise. I like the Y/T binding that Nick mentioned, but wonder if it's pricey and lengthy to produce.\n\nAre there any examples out there of this type of spread design? Benetton's Colors magazine comes in mind, but I don't have copies in hand. Any tips?\n\nAlso, is it an absolute no-no to split a letter in the gutter even with text this big (the book is roughly A4 in size)? I'm hesitant to set each chapter title differently as it'll affect the overall book design.\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts! :)\n\n"
