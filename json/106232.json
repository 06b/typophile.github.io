Practically, there's the problem that we already have a well established convention for the use of colour on the Web as signalling hypertext links. I notice that in their homepage demonstration they nowhere have a link embedded in Beeline-styled text; the one place where they do have a text link on the page is the one place where they've not applied the gradient styling.\n\n"

Don't think I'd use it myself, but if some folks find it useful then that's great.\n\nI noticed that in their \"Reading Challenge\" they used longer line lengths than I usually see on modern web pages or in e-readers (iPad, etc). I wonder what line lengths were used in the Stanford study.\n\n"
