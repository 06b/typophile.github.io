      "content": "I share with you one blog I did with my students [2nd year studio].\n\nEnjoy,  \nAS\n\n[1.]\n\nA complex unit may be confusing but if you classify the  \nrelated items into subgroups, it may be easier to deal  \nwith each of them. For instance, in your computer you  \nclassify a main folder’s content into subfolders in order  \nto deal with them more efficiently. Because by gathering  \nsimilar items into a group, you simplify the display of  \nthe files which would enable them to be easily overlooked  \nand analyzed. When you choose viewing the content of a  \nmain folder in groups, the difference in your perception  \nof quantity is huge.\n\nWhen you are trying to understand or solve complex things,  \ndealing with them as a whole would make your work harder.  \nHowever firstly examining them one by one and then putting  \nthe ones which resemble each other together would carry out  \nour work from being complex to being simple. Things which  \nare completely different from each other would create a  \nchaos and be non-sense but when they are classified and  \noffered as groups something more comprehensible, easily  \nperceived would arise.\n\nLife it self, is a complex system and you can only make  \nit simple by changing the way you look the events that are  \nhappening and by changing the point of view. Every complex  \nsystem has a simple solution which is lying under them and  \nthe only thing you need to do is, can see the way that is  \ngoing through the answer. All you need to do is, not to  \nmake it hard, just thinking in a different way... That is  \nwhat we need to do as a designer; make complex system  \nsimplified...\n\nComlexity is divided to the things that it is based on.  \nSometimes complexity may end up with a really good result.  \nIt depends on the things that you know how to use and how  \nto comlplete. With allof its sublements, graphic design is  \na complex and dense system. If you use all of your  \nopportunities in a simple and an efficient way, you will  \nsucceed. Thus, whatever complex work you do, it will look  \nplain and compact. To put the pieces in a most simple and  \nlogical way the whole work will have a voice. At last, no  \nmatter how comlex your work is , you can conclude your  \nwork perfectly by keeping it simple.\n\nSimple and complex are relatively perceived things and  \nreally depends on people’s moods and experiences; so don’t  \nknow what they mean universally except my instinctive  \nimpulses which is telling me “When you direct your  \nattention to something, if you are far from it you will  \nperceive that as simple and if you are close to it you  \nwill perceive that complex. It is same for eyes or nose or  \nyour brain.” For example if some one has great knowledge  \nabout a subject he will think that it is simple when he  \nstarts to work with it in real, because he will be far  \nfrom the issue because of being closer to its image in his  \nmind. On the other hand i believe that mathematically every  \nthing is possible in universe, so refusing that expression  \nis not in my nature. I think that method can simplify  \ncomplexes because it is creating the illusion of a sigh  \nfrom a far distant. However if you use it too much or  \nin wrong way it will destroy the thing not simplify it;  \ninspite of the result’s simplicity.\n\nOrganizing things is also simplifying them. When you  \norganize something by grouping, you make the subject tidy  \nand simple so the mind uses less time searching through  \nthe subjects for the necessary object. For example, there  \nis an instinct of grouping in the kitchen, like; glass are  \nalways somewhere together and close to them mugs or cups,  \nand another place there is dishes, and the knives are  \nsomewhere together as well as the spice are always  \ntogether in some other place in the kitchen, etc.\n\nFor example, in a complex system of many functions there  \nmay be the system elements that have the same job; but  \nin a different combination looks different. Therefore  \nsimplifying the complex combinations by using the right  \nelements exactly where they should be, in simple but  \nuseful combinations would be more appropriate.\n\nThis sencentes is too complex for me to explain as you  \nsaid in the sentence you should simplify for me to answer  \nit :) “... can be simplified by carefully grouping  \nrelated functions” as u wrote :)\n\nThe grouping system sometimes is better than the complex  \nsystem, because observation becomes easier.\n\nRelated functions can be found in any area of the  \nindustry, entertainment, business, etc... For instance,  \nmedia - it is composed of numerous different functions -  \nfrom the chief corporation owner who signs contracts and  \nairs the shows, plays, commercials and so on, to the  \nlighting boy - without whom the actual airing process  \nwould not take place. All the functions in between - the  \ndesigner, the art director, the sound coordinator, are a  \n’complex system of many functions’, which are related to  \neach other. Therefore, they can be called ’related  \nfunctions’ of one sphere, and can hence be grouped under  \none assemblage - the media.\n\n[2.]\n\nWhen you think about a mathematical equation, the more you  \nsimplify it, the less time you spend to reach a solution.  \nWhenever you come across any kind of problem, instead of  \nspending much time on trying to solve a complex problem,  \nif you try to simplify it first, the time you’re going to  \nwork on solving the problem will get shorter which enables  \nyou to save time, so that you can use the saved time  \nelsewhere in your life. That will save you from wasting  \ntime.\n\nReaching the conclusion in any area of life has short and  \neasy ways as well as long and difficult ways. When there  \nis the opportunity of using a short cut when we are going  \nsomewhere why would we choose the long way? Simplified  \nsolution is always attractive and it always looks more  \nworthy to be used.\n\nA good feeling from a simple event is not about what  \nhappened but about not using that too much.\n\nThe best way to save time is to choose the easy way  \ninstead of the complicated solutions. No matter how  \ncomplicated or hard the situation is, all you have to do  \nis to simplyfy it by using plane options. Simplycity is  \nthe most ingenious way to achive a positive emotional  \nexperience. For example the work we are given is so  \ncomplicated by thinking simple we can save our time. So we  \ncan solve the complicated sentences by making them simple.  \nYou will always have a chance to choose the easy way  \nbecause you are the one to control the situation.\n\nPractically perceiving simple things brings positive  \nemotional responses, actually in today’s world only simple  \nexpressions or creations creates response, because no one  \nwants to waste his precious time to understand a  \ncomplexity. Besides most of them don’t have that much time  \nor oppotunity. For example a minimalistic design will work  \nbetter in an advertisement, because most of the people  \nonly have chance to observe it in very little time, maybe  \njust for a moment while going to work, with their cars;  \nand they have even less time to judge it.\n\nMost of the people are lazy, including me, but they (we)  \ncan also be busy. So using (or having) simple things let  \nus have more time to use for other things. For example:  \nOne button technology(!) in NOKIA cell phones was a big  \nchange for me (remember them?). The cell phones now have  \nkind of joysticks as for guiding in the menu. It’s simple  \nand easy to use.\n\nA positive response derived from a ’simplicity experience’  \nand a positive emotional response achieved through an  \nexperience that is on the contrary complex, is both ways  \na positive response. Considering that the response (be it  \naccomplished through intricacy or through simplicity) is  \nequally positive - it is therefore useful (logic- positive  \nresponse = utility). Furthermore, if the response is useful  \neither way, then we contemplate which method brought the  \nsame result faster; consequently, coming to the conclusion  \nthat the ’simplicity experience’ is not only useful because  \nof the nature of the response, but also faster - because it  \nis the ’simple’ experience, and took less time to undergo.  \nHence - ’saving time’.\n\nLooking for simple solution for the problems, first of  \nall, will save your time. Basically if there is a simple  \nsolution to a problem why do have to look for complicated  \nones. It is a loss of time and energy. If your not in a  \nmath exam and your teacher did not ask you to write the  \ncomplex way with explanations, so you are not getting and  \nextra grade for the time you lose on the problem, than it  \nhas nothing to do with utility, simplify it as you can it  \nis also good for communication.\n\n[3.]\n\nSimplicity doesn’t always mean reducing the quantity in  \norder to achieve what is “less”. If adding more increase  \nthe quality of an experince, then we should go for it. If  \nrichness of many elements increases the quality, we should  \nnot hesitate to add them into that experince just to keep  \nit simple. A plain piece of cake may be delicious itself  \nbut some extra cream and powdered sugar may add a richer  \ntaste. So why not add them on top of the cake?\n\nSimple is the best but it never means that a simple which  \nis empty inside is valuable. When you are simplifying  \nsomething complex, you should never overlook important  \ndetails that would transform your work into a colorful and  \nrich one. Then it would be simplified yes, but we do not  \nneed an empty simple without any content. It is important  \nto simplify something by also letting it stay rich. In  \nother words ’say less, mean more’.\n\nThe life is full of experiences. Experiences are the  \nshapers of our lifes. As a metaphor we are like sculptures  \nor paintings waiting for the right material and the artist.  \nThe rich material that the artist is using, the most  \neffective the piece will be. My point is just don’t limit  \nyour life live what life brings to you. People shouldn’t  \nbe afraid of adding, because by skipping them you will  \nmiss many points. You will get complicated and you cannot  \nrecognize whats good or bad in life.\n\nI agree that first part of the expression about richness  \nof an experience but I don’t think that adding more  \nelements to a composition will work in real life. That is  \nso because no one have the responsibility to evaluate your  \nwork specially, they are choosing elements of their lives  \naccording to their own moods, interest and purposes and  \nthey don’t waste much time on other things. Accordingly  \na designer who creates complex and rich productions will  \nalso create more permenant and precise images in people’s  \nmind, if he can pass through their barriers. However in my  \nopinion he can only go through the barriers of very limited  \npeople who has the same understanding of life with him.\n\nSo if you have experience with an object it will make it  \neasy for you to perceive it. You may have some experiences  \nwith that object but why don’t you have another one. So  \nthis will make your work lot easier. Maybe, in some  \nsituations, experience may need some effort but do it.  \nLater on your perception will be lot easier.\n\nSometimes more of something increases the quality of the  \nexperience of that thing. For example, you write an essay,  \nwhich tells us about what the design is. If you only talk  \nabout what the design is, it is ok, but actually it needs  \nsome examples. With those examples you improve the meaning  \nof the essay.\n\nThe richness of this particular experience of writing  \nabout ’simplicity’ is absolutely priceless; my perception  \nof this assignment - helpful, yet absolutely confusing. My  \noverall intent from writing all this would be - to achieve  \na high grade (and maybe even understand a thing or two);  \nyours - to bond the notion of design with my brain, to  \neducate me, to feel complete, competent and satisfied. I  \nam trying to facilitate both our tasks as much as possible  \nby wasting space on this; at the same time I ’add more’  \nand fill up the word limit = not skimping, adding more!\n\n[4.]\n\nPeople tend to be afraid of the unknown. If you have no  \nidea about the work you are supposed to do, you feel  \nuncomfortable and stressed to start working on it because  \nit’s going to be something ambigious and you start to  \nperceive it more complex than it is. But if you’re already  \nfamiliar with the task, if you have already some experince  \nwith it beforehand, you’ll feel you have a control over  \nit which makes you ultimately perceive it simpler.\n\nKnowledge has an extremely important role in perceiving.  \nIf you do not know anything about what you are dealing  \nwith, you will be prejudiced and think that it is a mess  \nand it is very hard to understand. Also, if you do not  \nhave knowledge about a subject, you would not be aware  \nof the simple way to get to the end. So if you have  \na previous idea, you will perceive and solve everything  \nmuch more easily.\n\nIt is very important to have a knowlegde about basic  \nthings. Not even basic things you should also have a  \nknowlegde about life and what’s happening around it.  \nThese knowledges make your life easier because if you know  \nsomething about an event, you can easily realise what’s  \ngonna happen and it makes you feel safe cause you know  \nwhat you need to do when you face with an event that you  \nknow beforehand.\n\nEvery work you do has a concept everything in the world  \nhas an aim, according to that the more you know about the  \nsubject you are working on, the most perfect result you  \nwill get. Because if you get familiar with the concept  \nbeforehand that makes sense. Otherwise the result will be  \na failure. You have to got the motion. You have to touch  \nit from inside. Not knowing anything about the subject you  \nwill got lost and the final work will be mess. By getting  \nthe idea of the concept you can surely do it simple and  \ncorrect.\n\nAs i mentioned my opinion about this in the first  \nparagraph simplicity of the percieved thing depends on the  \ndistance of the perciever to the thing, both in physical  \nand conceptual meanings. Additionally if some one has a  \ngreat knowledge about some thing he will stay in far  \ndistance to that thing while percieving again.That is so  \nbecause his recognitional response to it will much more  \nand curiosity for it will be very less because of his  \nknowledge. Actually these people perefer to stay closer  \nto the image of that thing in their minds rather then its  \nreal.That is why if some one has knowledge about a thing,  \nwill percieve that thing more simple. On the other hand  \npeople may also stay far way to an issue if they don’t  \nhave any knowledge about it.\n\nKnowledge is important in perceiving things, even the  \nbasic ones. Gathering information about something gives  \nyou access to its usage. Confusion could be solved with  \nknowledge also. A simple user’s manual helps you  \nunderstand how to use a new television, or a help file  \nis useful in order to use a complex software. (Also the  \nteachers, instructors tells me that coming the class  \nprepared makes the trick. I should try that.)\n\nFor example your client asked you to do a project or  \nadvertising about some product that is brand new to usage  \nof humans or you’ve never heard of it before. Therefore it  \nwill take a lot of time for you to put it use in your head.  \nYou have to perceive what does this product stands for  \nin order fell something about it. However if you have an  \nobject that you’ve have experience before, for example  \nwater, it will be perceived much quickly.\n\nI complitely agree to this statement the more I know, the  \nless i spend time. This rule role in our daily life too.  \nTherefore, I am studying graphic design in Bilkent  \nUniversity; to get new ideas and to learn more. However,  \nin some situations having experience is more important  \nthan knowing something. Eg: An experienced cooker (but  \nhe/she doesn’t have the profesional education) feeds  \nfaster than an educated cooker (he/she graduated from a  \nturism/cooking school).\n\nIf you are going to start a project, it is better to know  \nabout the past of the theme, because it helps to make  \nan efficient project. When you know the theme, it become  \neasier to simplified the theme and also it helps to make  \nit less but more. By meaning less and more, sometimes less  \nwriting or something else is more attractive than writing  \nmore.\n\nKnowing ’about’ something and knowing ’something’ can be  \nmisinterpreted and classified under the same label.  \nUnderstanding a subject and knowing about it superficially  \nare two contradictory concerns. When meeting a person,  \nbackground knowledge could be helpful, yet at the same  \ntime it could be treacherous.\n\n[5.]\n\nIf you were a tailor you are aware of the fact that not  \nall materials are suitable for sewing all kind of clothes.  \nA wedding dress, a suit, a night gown, a sport suit they  \nall need different materials in order to function  \nproperly. If silk is used for a sport suit and a cotton  \nfabric for a wedding dress, it would be clear that those  \nmaterials fail to comply with those dresses because their  \nnatural usage lie somewhere else. However their failure  \ndoesn’t mean they are bad materials. Their failure is just  \na message for us that they simply don’t fit within their  \ncontext. They are not suitable materials for that specific  \ntask, their usage just lies somewhere else.\n\nUsing a material out of its purpose would never give good  \nresults. For instance if you cover a coach with a curtain  \nfabric it would easily be worn out because it is too thin.  \nIt’s like a key and a lock or a puzzle piece. It has to fit  \nwhere it is placed. A material is only valuable when it is  \nused for its purpose. I mean you should use gold material  \nto make a necklace not to make spoon. Because it would  \nlose its identity and value. So using material where its  \nsuitable is important.\n\nEvery material has its own basic usage whats coming from  \nnature. Everything starts in nature by embellishing the  \nusage of the material in a bad way you are making it  \nuseless. That means you are just wasting it, instead of  \nusing its basic functions. By using the basic functions  \nof a material you can always get a competent product. By  \naccomodating the material naturally to the product, you  \nalso do it simple and serviceable. Then the result makes  \na sense. Just do it simple and be natural.\n\nIf a material or an element does not work well in a  \ncomposition this means you have to search its appropriate  \nusage in other and most probably in simpler and more  \nnaturel compositions. It is very hard to find examples  \nabout it to me, but simply a can say that, maybe organic  \nmaterials such as wood may not work well in expressing  \nfeelings about technology. Metals, plastics and polimers  \nwould be more suitable probably. On the other hand in my  \nopinion wood will be more appropriate material to express  \nlife. Actually i totally believe the importance and  \neffectiveness of the materials in creations and mostly  \nin the ones which has the purpose to give messages to  \nthe people.\n\nSo if you’re material failed to gain success in a specific  \napplication, it means that you’re pushing too hard or using  \nwrong material to solve the problems look for simple or  \nnatural answers. For example if you have a lemon and you  \nwant to slice it to pieces and if every time you use your  \n“light saber” it fries then may be you should you knife  \nto slice it.\n\nThis sentence blames the user because, the producers have  \nto think of the failures of the materials before the  \ndesign/production: it is illogical to say that user is  \ndoing wrong, producers have to thing all applications  \nabout the product. It has to world-wise. World-wise have  \nto rule hole the world it should not be lies “elsewhere”.\n\nIf something isn’t working out, it isn’t the persons’  \nfault. And it’s not the materials’ fault either. The only  \nproblem is that both of them don’t have any bonds between  \nthem.\n\nClearly, if a material has been initially produced for a  \nparticular purpose, it is an indication that this material  \nmust be applied specifically, and used as instructed.\n\n[6.]\n\nMusic is a kind of noise which we love to hear, which  \nevokes our feelings, arouse them but if it is too loud,  \nor if it’s a kind of music that you dont enjoy, which you  \nthink is bad, it just doesnt evoke anything within you,  \ndoesn’t make you feel anything.\n\nIn every area of art, there is feeling and emotions. For  \ncreating that emotion artists use some elements specific  \nto that art. For example, Van Gogh used colors to express  \nhis emotions while Mozart utilized notes to create his  \ncompositions. However, if they made a mess of those  \nelements by using excess amount of them, they would only  \nbe creating noise which prevents them from expressing  \ntheir feelings accurately. Using too many elements leads  \nto complexity and this destroys the feeling that artist  \ntries to give.\n\nAs an example I can say that music helps people feel.  \nMusic talks and plays a game with your brain. Sometimes  \nmakes you feel sad, sometimes confused and sometimes makes  \nyou feel happy. It may also let you in a different  \nfeelings. You may feel lots of feelings with the sound you  \nhear and it may change to other person.\n\nThe most important thing in life, is to live your life  \nwith the help of your instincts. The feelings that lies  \nbeneath you, should be reflected in the way you feel which  \neventualy is your “noise”. Noise is the metaphor that is  \nreflecting your senses. Same thing with the work you do.  \nIt has to reflect the noise with a language that people  \ncan understand simply. So you always have to follow your  \ninstincts in order to have a voice. The feelings lying  \ninside you has to figure the speech, that means to form  \nyour instincts and reflect them outside.\n\nIn the aspects of graphic design it means, in a  \ncomposition there must be no more or less elements than  \nit needs to be, because if it is less the work will have  \nproblemlems in giving its message completely. On the other  \nhand if it is too much elements they will naturelly damage  \nthe understanding of the message. For example if we want  \nto create the image of a tree in my but just use petal or  \na leaf the message may be lost and at the same time if we  \nuse many trees that time we may create the image of forest  \nrather than a tree.\n\nGraphic Design is for communication. It is a tool to  \ncreate a communiation between the thing, object, whatever,  \nand the consumer, user, etc. This is done by messages, but  \ntelling the messages right away is not good for marketing  \npurposes (that makes the commercials dull). So as  \ndesigners, we need something a less obvious cover for  \nthe message but if we cover the message too much then it  \nwouldn’t be readable anymore. This problem could be seen  \nin media; TV and papers both; like they use celebrities in  \ncommercials but most of the time the fame of the celebrity  \nrenders the subject invisible. (...and yes “feel” means  \ntwo things in Turkish too. One is to feel through skin,  \nand the other is through, umm...ahh... soul? heart? Like  \nsensing.)\n\nFor instance in if you play something in order to feel you  \ngot to have some emphasis if you don’t your song will be  \nboring. However, in your play if you emphasize everything  \nthan all you’ve got again will be noise and therefore it  \nwill be boring.\n\nIn order to create something you have to have some  \ninformation about it, but if you’ve just the information  \nit is only the information. I mean to have a specific  \nthing there should be the existance of attributes,  \nhowever, if these qualities have been passed over  \nquantitatively these values will be disappeared.\n\nSometimes more is not good, because having less of  \nsomething is certainly better than having more. For example,  \nif there’s too much noise, then you are going to lose the  \nmain thing. Such as if your friend tries to tell you  \nsomething in a loudly place; you will not get what your  \nfriend is talking about.\n\nUnderstanding a new concept or ’feeling’ it is only possible  \nwhen this concept is voiced clearly. If the concept is not  \nvoiced clearly - the meaning is lost, thus, the concept is  \nnot grasped.\n\n[7.]\n\nSometimes in order to achieve simplicity, for example a  \nsimpler look, a simple design, it takes harder work, more  \neffort, mpore attempt. But once you achieve it it will be  \nperceived as very rich, as ’more’ because it took so much  \neffort, attention and care to reach it.\n\nSometimes something which seems invaluable at first sight,  \nmay become priceless by the help of a little care and  \neffort. For instance, a cheap fabric can gain value in the  \nhands of a talented stylist. S\\he can use the fabric for a  \nflawless design and the people who see it judge the value  \nof the fabric based on the design. So, simple + effort can  \nsometimes mean a good job.\n\nIf you focus on the minor things too much, they become  \nmore important than they are.\n\nEverything starts with something. It doesnt matter if you  \nstart with a tiny point or a huge and empty point. The  \nonly fact is that if you got the motion about thing you  \ndo, if you really put effort on in even its not satisfying  \nfor you at the begining, because of your effort the result  \nwill end up perfect. By forcing your self to get the  \nresult immadiately you are just fooling your self. But if  \nyou really put your motions and effort in to the work,  \nyou will totally get satisfied with it.\n\nI think a precies and perfectly done work contains signals  \nwhich can touch to the instincts of people and may force to  \nbelieve the correctness of its message. Because when people  \nsees the “care” they will trust more to the creator.  \nHowever some times more gestural, more fastly and  \napperantly random creation, be more expressive and gives  \nits message more easly. Actually these all depends on the  \nmessage that wanted to be given.\n\nSimple things doesn’t have to be basic or empty or dull.  \nTell what you gotta tell, in a simple way, with a style  \nand it’s ok. By thinking and working on something in order  \nto simplify it, you also make it refined and more legible,  \nthus more interesting.\n\nIn order to perceive and understand something, if you  \nspend so much time on this “less”, even you don’t have  \nexperience, you will get something eventually. For example  \na traditional statue in your home it may remind you of your  \nfriend because it is your birthday present. However if you  \nare curious and want to know where t came from you can  \nsearch and you may find out that it is a native-African  \nproduct and somehow your holding it in your hands right  \nknow. From now on your perception on the object has  \nchanged with more attention.\n\nI don’t agree this sentence in some situations, when I sit  \nto design something in Photoshop always the first thing  \nthat I create is better than the others that I put more  \neffort & attention to design it. As my previous Basic  \nDesign introductor Alex says “The first photograph that  \nI took is always better than the second and third”. As I  \nsaid before, in some situations less effort & attention  \nmay be the result of the better products.\n\nIf a project seems insignificant and simple at the  \nbeginning - it could only mean that with the proper ’care,  \nattention, and effort’, it could become a grand success and  \ncan triple in value. The more ’care, attention, and effort’  \nis involved in the process of any development, the more  \nsignificant it becomes - truly great masterpieces (from  \nart to relationships) have required massive attention,  \nendless effort, and constant care. These components make  \nthe value priceless, and the more the input of those  \ncomponents, the higher the price and greater the value.\n\nSometimes less is more taking attention than the more one.  \nSuch as if you write something much but boring, the reader  \nmight not read the whole text. So, you should write the  \ntext less and also readable. It might help the reader to  \nunderstand it.\n\n[8.]\n\nBesides the laws of the physical universe, we can not  \nunderestimate or ignore the facts of what is artifical;  \nsociety. Society is somewhat different than nature, it is  \nsomething made with intention by people. A design of any  \nkind for example an architectural structure can be  \nconsidered more successful, if it fits within its  \nsurroundings, within the city it’s gonna be in, the human  \ncontext; social context it’s gonna be a part of, otherwise  \nit will be detached from its environment, it won’t  \ncommunicate with its surrounding social context, it will  \nfail to enter a dialogue with its environmental social  \naspects.\n\nIf you want to have a good, different consequence you  \nshould force the limits of reality and even certainty.  \nYou should have an extraordinary point of view. Sometimes  \nan abstract element is as significant as a concrete  \nelement. In art when creating a simple work, you should go  \nbeyond the physical walls and look for the answer up in  \nthe sky which is unknown and abstract.\n\nThings will be straigh forward, if you recognise what is  \npossible and follow the rules of society.\n\nTrying to achive the aim of the physical universe you  \nshould take the absolute laws from it. For the artifical  \nuniverse you should also constrain importance and equalize  \nthem when striving for simplicity. That means you should  \ntake parts from both of them but to simplify it in a equal  \nway. By making them equally simple, you are also balancing  \nthem in a specific way. Things get really plain if you  \njust follow the rules of the artifical universe. In a way  \nthey are different but if you know how to intagrate them  \nto each other you will understand the system easily.\n\nI think we are dealing with infinity and living inside  \nof it. So we have infinite possiblities of actions and  \nopportunities. However at the same time we are limited  \nin infinite ways both physically and mentally or both  \nuniversally and individually; but it does not cause much  \nproblem because infinite minus infinite will still give  \nyou the infinite.That means we are totally free and we can  \nstill prefer simplicity even if the situations forces us  \nto be complex. For example if we are designing a poster to  \nadvertise some thing which needs to be given in details we  \ncan not simply ignore some of the details, because we are  \ndependent on who we are advertising to live. However we  \ncan still simplify it in a smart way. I don’t want to go  \nfurther in that example, just like a science-fiction  \nwriter who does not have to invent beaming up people,  \nin order to write it.\n\nMaybe the answer that you are looking for simplicity is  \nnot within the border of the nature and maybe nature is  \nnot making it any easier for you at all. May be artificial  \nlaws formed by human experience can lead you to simplicity  \nmore easily in the name of gained experience. Do not wait  \nfor the rain if you’re thirsty open your tap and drink it.\n\nIf you gonna stick the unconditional salt, you cant rule  \nthe large areas. For our area I mean designing, we should  \nnot recognize only the absolute laws ’cause those laws  \nmaybe restrict our way of seeing and doing. Simplicity is  \nthe main aim for every human being to understand it, our  \nworks should be world-wise as i said in the previous  \nsentences.\n\nWhen creating something (be it artistic or routine),  \nsimplicity is a necessary element of production, for it  \nbrings with it sense, unity, and conclusion. There are  \n’absolute laws’ that have been established throughout the  \ntime period of human existence; these laws are constraints  \nand sometimes even obstacles (yet, they must be kept in  \nmind when anything is being created, as not to disturb the  \nbalance of nature). In order to achieve a more meaningful  \nand unique result, one must strive to ’look outside the  \nbox’ and appreciate not only the norm - the given laws,  \nbut also be able to balance that with the ’artificial’  \nlaws, hence, embellishing the result.\n\n[9.]\n\nSometimes the more you gain experience of doing something,  \nthe more you repeat it in time, you convert it in a  \nsimplier state each time. Once you become highly  \nexperienced about that issue, once you accumulate  \nknowledge you become more refined and you start being able  \nto evaluate it simpler in your mind subconciously.\n\nWhen we’re simplifying something we eliminate the details  \nwhich are less important, and sometimes our brain  \nautomatically does it for us grounding it upon our  \nexperiences. We subconsciously know what will work and  \nwhat won’t, as our brain makes a habit of categorizing  \nand grouping elements due to past studies.\n\nSimplicity is mostly related to the concious reduction.  \nSimplicity has also a different ways related with the  \nunconcious. The thoughts stucked in your unconcious has  \nnot spreaded. So they are not the forms to reflect  \nsimplicity. But the complicated forms may cause  \ncomplexity. Unconcious is the illusion of the stucked  \nforms lying inside. It’s really hard to relate them to the  \nreality so it is also hard to make them simple. But also  \na complex system can be simplified by grouping the  \nfunctions. Be conciously simple by relating them to simple  \nforms.\n\nI am not the expert of psycology so i can not make  \ngeneralised predictions about this expression; but i  \nbelieve that sub-conscious can also make simplifications  \nusually. Besides that it doesn’t matter which part of our  \nconsciouses make simplifications and reductions,more  \noften; but it is much more important that the which part  \nis the target of the simpfied things. I think, the answer  \nis the sub-conscious and simple creations have great power  \nto enter there and stay there. At the same time, according  \nto Freud the sub-conscious controls the life, so we can  \nunderstand that why all commertial logos designed by the  \npeople who are extremely interested in simplicity.\n\nFiltering is a kind of simplification, as well as  \nsubconsious oppressing your thoughts. You would  \nunserstand, by instinct, that some of the messages, in a  \ncertain way, would not be readable to some people, so you  \nreduct it.\n\nMostly we do simplify consciously, probably, because of we  \nare disturb by the noise or unnecessary emphasis. However  \nif it is done subconsciously may be it is because we tend  \nto simplify subconsciously because we use to do it. Again  \nmay be subconsciously we know we can communicate easily  \nif we simplify.\n\nIn order to simplify, one must break up (or ’reduce’)  \nthe chain of complications that hinders the process of  \nsimplification. Human beings are fully aware of this,  \nand therefore ’consciously reduce’ the details and  \nimpediments, that way decreasing the amount of complexity  \nto a minimum, and achieving simplification. Subconscious  \ncompression on the other hand is not reduction - it is not  \ngetting rid of complexities, but ’compressing’ them  \ntogether to create a fastidious and detailed final result;  \na result that was derived not from reduction but from  \ncompression. This ’compression’ is subconscious, more  \nunique and hence more valuable than the commonly known  \n’reduction’.\n\n[10.]\n\nIf you think of a less and more two opposite sides of a  \nstraight line, one each end, equilibrium point, at which  \nbalance & harmony is achieved should not necessarily fall  \nin the middle of these two poles. It can be found at many  \npoints that exist through that straight line. But the top  \npoint of less which is the ”simplest” and and the top  \npoint of more which is “complex” can never be the  \nequilibrium point because they are extremes, they dont  \nprovide any balance. Choosing only black&white colors for  \na design may be “too less”, those two colors may not be  \nenough to express, to say the things that you wanna say  \nbut you may think using bright colors would totally  \ndestroy the effect you want to achieve, so between between  \nthese two extremes, you have plenty of options, you might  \nwant to have light colors or a little more brighter colors  \nrather than very light ones.You can achieve the equilibrium  \npoint at which you obtain balance between these two  \nextremes, but choosing one of them, only black and white  \nor the brightest colors would not be the the answer to the  \nproblem, would not create the balance you’re looking for.\n\nLoading too much to a work does not mean that it is  \nperfect. Also leaving it before it is mature in order  \nto make it simple and not too complex does not make it  \nexcellent. If we want to achieve equilibrium we should try  \nto avoid touching extreme points. Simplicity lies in the  \nthin line between less and more and it is difficult to be  \non that line.\n\nThe work you are producing may breed less or more. They  \nhave a really delicate line between them. In order to make  \nyour work equally balanced, you should control its own  \nlimits and you shouldnt add any unnecessary things in it.  \nThen you can control the avarage. The line lying between  \nless and more is really breakable and oversensitive. It  \ncan even fall to the ground or fly through to the extreme  \npoint. By controlling the limits carefully and balanced  \nthe work will be in a equilibrium.\n\nThat “less breeds less and more breeds more, except the  \nextremes” is not a universal fact. Sometimes less can  \nbreed more and the more can not and this cases may not be  \nextremes always. Actually less in other words simple in  \nexpression can create more effect in mind. Because of its  \nsimplicity it can pass though human minds’ self-protection  \nmechanism. Besides that in limited time people can even not  \nperceive and understand fully, a more; but at same  \nlimitation they can even percieve understand and evaluate,  \na less; and maybe much more.\n\nLess is not always meaning simple and more is not always  \ncomplex. Simplicity lies in the middle of them (but close  \nto the less side for most of the time, imho). Using too  \nmouch objects in the project could make it less legible,  \nand using less objects would not give the message  \nproperly. The posters we see in the streets; they would  \nhave a lot of information on them but that makes hard to  \nunderstand the real thing, and sometimes they give too  \nlittle information so it is also hard to understand them.\n\nEquilibrium can be only gained by the harmony of elements  \nused. For example, on the project you’re using a color lot  \n(let’s say extremely lot) and another less there the  \nbalance will be lost. Again on another example, you are  \nusing an element in small amount, then you don’t have the  \nemphasis, however if you use it to much again all you have  \ngot will be noise. There for equilibrium is somewhere  \nbetween but never close to the extremes.\n\nI know from the Science lessons from High school that the  \nworld has a natural cycle and a balance, in every way.  \nEg: Animal A eats Animal B to survive, same here with Animal  \nB, with Animal C. If Animal A eats lots of Animal B, the  \nnumber of the Animal B will decrease after a time period  \ncause the number of the Animal B decreased the number of  \nthe Animal C, will increase this un-balanced situation  \nwill be balance when the Animal A is overnumbered and  \ncan’t find Animal B’s to survive, so the number of the  \nAnimal B will increase... This goes like this. To show it  \non a simple graphic:\n\n5kg—————3kg ===\\> there is a balance between them, 4kg;  \n5kg—————0kg ===\\> but here there is not an equilibrium,  \n there is no absolout balance here.\n\nWhen planning to reach a positive outcome, one must always  \nkeep in mind the two extreme sides of the argument that are  \npossible. The ’less’ side consists of absence of detail,  \nstraightforward conservative and minimalist elements, and  \npure simplicity; the ’more’ side, is completely opposite  \nin detail, value, and intent. If only one side is taken  \ninto account when producing things or making decisions,  \nthen the decision would be biased, subjective and extreme.  \nThus, both sides should be weighed, examined and juxtaposed  \nin order to reach an ideally objective consensus. Balance =  \nperfect solution.\n\nEverything has to be normal. Sometimes less is not better  \nas more one and more is not good as less one. If you are  \nmaking pasta, you should not leave it in boiling water too  \nmuch, because it makes the pasta like dough. Less boiling  \nis not also good for pasta.\n\nCharacters : 39500\n\nAuthors :\n\nAslı Deniz Mete  \nBurcu Baykan  \nÇagri Biber  \nEla Agalar  \nEmre Bakır  \nLevent Ince  \nMaria Goncharova  \nNeslihan Tepehan  \nÖzgür Demir  \nSimge Yüceel\n\n"

There are plenty of great designers working for clients of little renown and who therefore achieve no status. There are also well regarded designers who have good marketing skills and connections but are pretty unexceptional as designers.  \nThe smarter the designer the better the problem solver. The more “artistic” the designer the more visually appealing the result. The problem is that you can create a visually appealing piece of work which does not do much to solve the clients problem. Likewise, you can solve a problem intellectually but fail to give it the form it needs to succeed. The ideal designer is the Yin/Yang composite who can do both at the same time.  \nThe exceptional designer sees the REAL problem and solves it. The challenge is to convince the client that your solution is what is needed. “You can’t always get what you want—but if you try some time, you just might find, that you get what you need.”—said another rock star who can’t read music.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

How they do it may be fascinating and where all the work is, but there’s no formula to it.\n\nThat being said, design is rarely without constraints and restrictions, many of which require planning and thought. A great band poster or album design often involves more heart than head, but a solid interface, or an emergency manual that can be used in a rain storm during a panic involves much more head.\n\nDefining design is far less useful than defining the design problem and working with it. Design is easy. Successful design is the real trick, and that’s specific to the project.\n\n"

Writing and performing the kind of music McCartney does doesn’t require notation. —You do need it for orchestration though.\n\nMcCartney was very educated in music, by listing and playing. When you play guitar or bass, you learn chord structure, and its relation to melody. So he is extremely knowledgeable and educated in music, just not musical notation. Same with Louis Armstrong.\n\nUnlike type design, in music, it’s not on the page and in the eye, is in the sound and the ear.\n\n"
