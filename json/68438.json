  "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI'm stumped. Does anyone here know how to detect reversed postscript hints using Python in FontLab?\n\nHere's what I tried:  \n`\nfont = fl.font\nglyphs = font.glyphs`  \n`\nfor index in range(len(fl.font)):\n\tglyph = fl.font[index]\n\tvhw = glyph.vhints.width\n\tif len(vhw) < 0:\n\t\tprint glyph.name, vhw\n`\n\nI find there are two things wrong here (but I don't know how to fix them).  \n1. FL py reports width as not being an attribute of hhints  \n2. `len(vhw) < 0` returns nothing even when I know those instances are present\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n",
