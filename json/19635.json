They work well enough in adobe illustrator, indesign and photoshop but they do not seem to work in apple keynote or powerpoint. This makes me think that the problem is with the screen font. Does anybody have any clue how to remedy this situation?\n\n [‹ Automatic Bold in Fontlab 4](http://web.archive.org/web/20080214092743/http:/typophile.com/node/19659 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Opentype Random Contextual Alternates ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080214092743/http:/typophile.com/node/19625 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
