I explored many san sarifs and even threw Didot in just to see... to no avail. I am at a loss, frankly.\n\nI did make some headway by not using heavy weights. Throwing in a light Dicot (not sure where this came from... can't find info on origins). But I feel like the swell? fillet? (the round corners) aren't doing me any favors.\n\n",
