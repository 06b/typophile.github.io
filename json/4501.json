The closest similar I've found so far is Font Bureau's [Shimano Square Black Narrow](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124719/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/shimano/squareblacknarrow/testdrive.html?s=SUMMIT&p=60), but I need something more serify.   \n   \n ![Summit](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124719im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/34451.gif)   \n   \nThanks gang.\n\n",

I don't have any details regarding its usage, I just do IDs for our customer service crew when they get stumped.   \n   \nHowever, that's a good idea you had. If the customer isn't needing much more in terms of additional characters, it would be a breeze to whip up.\n\n"
