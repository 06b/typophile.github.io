Any suggestions for a (super) close alternative?\n\nI've considered [Amalia](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221327/http:/www.ourtype.be/), [Dederon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221327/http:/www.suitcasetype.com/index.php?lmut=en&part=fonts&font=9) and [Dolly](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221327/http:/underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview), but they don't quite make up for Alita's unique postmodern qualities. I've also considered [Oxtail](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221327/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html) but it's way on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nI understand I might just be stubborn, but thought I'd seek advice. Anything helps, thanks!\n\n",
