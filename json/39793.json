[Veer's The Skinny blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013125118/http:/blog.veer.com/archives/001705.html#commentola) received a amazing use of [Burgues Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013125118/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000267) . Maybe some day I ll do the same. I have the fonts, now I need the courage!\n\n",
