These are now unfortunately removed.\n\nMy plan is to cover some impressions of the conference on my blog [Typografism](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019111428/http:/typografism.se/). It's usually in Swedish and deals with the kind of stuff that other, _better_, bloggers, like James Mosley misses out on. For instance the fact that Simon de Colines during a period included [killer rabbits](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019111428/http:/typografism.se/?p=176) on his book covers. Also featured are rebuses of Swedish type designers (I'm particularly happy with [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019111428/http:/typografism.se/wp-content/uploads/rebus1.gif), even if it's in Swedish you can figure it out) and reflections on ornament, Ben Shahn and my brief adventures as a Commodore 64 type-designer.\n\nA brief summary in English could of course be added to the St Petersburg blogposts as an attempt to establish myself as an important type blog authority of international reputation.\n\nI expect some assistance from Göran (_this will be first time he hears of it, btw_) in covering the Typetech part.\n\nSee You there!\n\nƒ\n\n"
