I was trying to acheive a simple glyph substitution:\n\nfeature liga {  \n sub A E by AE;  \n} liga;\n\nAs I hit the »Compile« Button, the following Message appeared:\n\n[FATAL] aborting because of errors:  \nsyntax error at \"feature\"  \n[/Users/jurgen/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea 6]\n\nWhy? What can I do?\n\nThanks in advance,  \nJuergen\n\n",
