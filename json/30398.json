      "content": "Overlapping has got to be the soul of script fonts. There's nothing wrong with it in my estimation.  \nCritiquing, then--  \n-the a seems a little malformed when inside of a word. I think it's that the bowl is tilted less than the stem.  \n-n probably too wide.  \n-The little loop in b, o, w, and v ought to be similar, but if you don't want them all identical (after all, it is a handwriting font), at least change the loop on the o. It's too small, so it shows up as a large glob. Either make it bigger like the b's or close it like the v's.  \n-outstrokes on u and x don't flow as well as the others.  \n-possibly the top of c could come farther right, and maybe open e up some?  \n-the right stem of the y should be more like the u's.\n\nThis is very precise and nice, and it must have been tough to think at times with such a steep slant, but you seem to have made it work nonetheless very well. Good job on this.\n\n"

Lots of ligatures will make it more convincing - especially when duplicate characters appear together.\n\nI've just completed an OT script with a few features, so get in touch if you have any questions.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"
