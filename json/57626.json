But they aren’t working out for me :|\n\nI would like something much heavy[ier], but I’m open to any suggestions at this point! Maybe even a serif?\n\nCheers—  \nTH\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090506123317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sys_abc_5589.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090506123317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sys_inktraps_4857.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090506123317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sy_eyerer_3826.jpg)\n\n",
