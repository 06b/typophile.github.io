They have classified ads, forums, tons of info about the history of letterpress, etc.\n\nI started printing about a year ago in NYC at a place called [The Center for Book Arts](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203153817/http:/www.centerforbookarts.org/newsite/) and I am hooked. It is the antidote to hours of staring at a computer screen. I’d be amazed if there wasn’t a similar Center in London... Good luck!\n\n"

I remember getting a catalog of theirs in the mail, but I really don’t know how things work in terms of people who aren’t matriculated. The site doesn’t seem to be working for me right now for unknown reasons, but I’m almost certain they had 4 different options of enrollment; undergraduate, post, professional and pre-college on weekends. Hopefully that is a possibility for you so you don’t have to spend all that money for what may be just a two day workshop [most of the ones I’ve heard of are very brief].\n\nI’ve personally taken a 10 week letterpress class via continuing education courses at SVA in NYC. There is also Intima Press workshops in a wee little studio, also in NYC- [http://studiosq.tripod.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203153817/http:/studiosq.tripod.com/ \"http://studiosq.tripod.com/\") those are usually 2-3 day workshops.\n\n"
