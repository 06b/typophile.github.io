      "content": "Hi Damian,  \nWebfonts served by Google Fonts and most other webfonts services are usually sub-setted (that means its optimized, and some glyphs are removed to make the file smaller so it loads faster).\n\nTo force Google to send you the entire full file (no subsetting) you have to specify \"subsetting=all\".  \nHere is an example on how to do that for the lobster font: [http://www.impallari.com/lobster#subsetting](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310051046/http:/www.impallari.com/lobster#subsetting \"http://www.impallari.com/lobster#subsetting\")  \nYou can do the same for Raleway or any other font.\n\nOnce you are getting the full font, in your CSS you need to add this code to activate the lnum feature in all browsers:  \nfont-feature-settings: \"lnum\"  \n-moz-font-feature-settings: \"lnum\"  \n-webkit-font-feature-settings: \"lnum\"  \n-ms-font-feature-settings: \"lnum\"  \n-o-font-feature-settings: \"lnum\"\n\nBy the way, the latest Raleway release (v3) a few days ago, also include Italics and Cyrillics. Is available here: [http://www.impallari.com/projects/update/100](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310051046/http:/www.impallari.com/projects/update/100 \"http://www.impallari.com/projects/update/100\") and will also be available in Google Fonts pretty soon.\n\n"

      "content": "Yep, is strange. But web-developers are very strict about optimization. They optimize everything: css, javascript, etc... even small 1kb gifs icons making sprites files to save http requests. They want the fonts to be compressed in the same way, even if that means removing some glyphs and OT features.\n\nCurrently in Google Fonts there are more subsetting options:  \n- Latin,  \n- Latin Extended,  \n- Cyrillic,  \n- Cyrillic Extended,  \n- Greek,  \n- Greek Extended,  \n- Khmer,  \n- Vietnamese,  \n- All (disable subsetting and get the full font).  \n- Your can also roll your own custom subsets, using the \"text=xxxx\" parameter.\n\nBut they are mostly intended for language support, and not yet for OT features.  \nAs you might know, not all OT features are currently supported by all browsers, but hopefully in the near future they will, and I also hope for the subsetting options to improve in all the webfonts services.\n\nTypeKit only offers 2 options:  \n- Default (Latin)  \n- All Characters (subsetting off)\n\nH&JF has done a great job in their service, in particular about the subsetting options. They have an \"easy to use\" and \"easy to understand\" interface for selecting which glyphs gets included and which ones gets removed, allowing the user to fine-tune the subsetting optimizations.  \n [http://www.typography.com/cloud/feature-tour/images/ft\\_characters\\_1x.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150310051046/http:/www.typography.com/cloud/feature-tour/images/ft_characters_1x.png \"http://www.typography.com/cloud/feature-tour/images/ft\\_characters\\_1x.png\")\n\nI don't know what are the subsetting options that the other services offer to their users. But still, all this webfonts thing is still in an early phase, and there is much to improve when looking at the future.\n\n"
