  "content": "Hi, I'm designing a cook book and it needs to have a \"home made\" feel so using a handwritten font for tips and explanations ... I have used Quickpen ( [https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/trial-by-cupcakes/quickpen/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321232610/https:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/trial-by-cupcakes/quickpen/ \"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/trial-by-cupcakes/quickpen/\")) which I love but the client has decided they want something that they think is more readable. Just wondering if anyone has any suggestions? I like the shape and flow of quickpen - would love something with a similar feel and welcome any feedback from here.  \nThanks!\n\n",
