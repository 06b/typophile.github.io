Has anyone ever succeeded in doing such a thing or do I have to contact someone directly at Village to obtain it ?  \nThank you very much.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Image 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203175033/http:/typophile.com/files/Image%201_2.png) | 20.49 KB |\n\n [‹ What's on your word processor for everyday use?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203175033/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38330 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Is Avenir an appropriate typeface for wayshowing signage? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203175033/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32176 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
