      "content": "Sorry Jean-Louis but I'm pretty convinced this one should be custom. Officine Panerai was an official supplier to the Regia Marina, the Royal Italian Navy, supplying watches and precision instruments. In the first decades of the 20th century Officine Panerai began experimenting intensively with luminous materials in an effort to make instrument dials, sights, and telescopic devices that could be employed reliably in the dark. The main specificity of their first model Radiomir is a 2 layer dial. Bottom disk is plainly coated with a zinc sulphide and radium bromide luminescent combination. Top one is a completely black stencil, cut out with the digits thus needing a specific stencil design.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you all! Custom, that's nothing to be sorry about Ryuk. It's proof that the better things don't come off-the-shelf.\n\nI absolutely love their design and brand ID. It's understated (except the size), but there's a warmth in the colours, in the shape of the letters, etc.\n\nThough it's all a bit more marketing than actual watchmaking genius, it works. Bill Clinton used to wear one back in the days, and maybe still does, and it seems the choice for young investment bankers. Since the case diameters are so large, the watches are highly visible, which makes them first choice for the nouveaux riches who like to show off. Today, even my barber uses one!\n\nDefinitely not for me, except that beautiful table clock. But then, who needs tables clocks?\n\n"

My only remaining question is about what year did they introduce the design for these particular numbers.\n\nMany interesting font suggestions, but I now believe that none of them, including the Gotham Rounded numbers -- which are too narrow and have mid height waist lines -- capture the flavor of the numbers in the Officine Panerai dial. Rather than picking and choosing number sets that are poor approximations, its probably easier just to make the numbers from scratch. For example:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041844im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DHTPaneraiNumbersBetaSM_5998.jpg)\n  \nThe numbers not shown on the dial, i.e. \\_0\\_, \\_4\\_, \\_5\\_, and \\_7\\_, are guesses based on the known numbers.  \nDon \n"
