The piece was  \nentitled ’Football behind the Iron Curtain’ so I immediately thought of having  \na look at constructivism, but it turns out to be exclusively about germany  \nso this seems a bit misguided.\n\nAny help and historical enlightenment would be greatly appreciated,\n\nG\n\n [‹ Phone Book Typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20080506071455/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32808 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tech Illustration Billing ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080506071455/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32795 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I don’t see how it has much influence on post-war design or on football!\n\nActually, something “bland” like Helvetica or Univers might be the most appropriate here.\n\nOn [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080506071455/http:/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu%C3%9Fball-Weltmeisterschaft_1974), you can see the logo from the 1974 World Cup. This was hosted (and won!) by West Germany, although the East German team beat them in the preliminary round.\n\n"

I’ve also used this;\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080506071455im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/DDR_4648.png)\n  \nwhich I understand to be the emblem for the DDR. Is this correct or have I got confused? Was it used in conjunction with the football team?\n\nMuch appreciated,\n\nG\n\n"

      "content": "I’m sort of allergic to the DDR, but that looks like their emblem to me. I have no idea what their national team graphics or design looked like, but it probably changed several times over the decades, just like West Germany’s did (just compare the three jerseys that the West German team wore during each of their three World Cup victories in 1954, 1974, and 1990).\n\nDIN isn’t such a bad choice, it is German, and was used during the cold war on West German highway signs (it is still on all German highway signs today, of course). I believe that it was drawn during the 1930s, but I don’t really know exactly. I also have no idea what sort of highway signage the East Germans had.\n\n…and there is no need to call me Mr.!\n\n"
