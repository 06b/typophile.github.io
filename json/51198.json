The DSMJ has the right to distribute the fonts freely as part of their 'exclusivity' for the next two years.\n\nThe EULA also states that the fonts may be used on up to 25 workstations after which they become commercial. So, a corporate user will actually have to pay a license fee.\n\nThe EULA is there to ensure that users don't distribute the fonts themselves, as much as there are no modifications or reverse engineering. It is a protected font product like any other commercial font.\n\nSo, I can put your minds at rest. The DSMJ is fully within their rights to announce this free download. As a user you may use the fonts in your work as you wish, as long as you follow the EULA.\n\nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag Ltd\n\n"

It's not that different to fonts being distributed with Windows. As we retain all the rights to the fonts we have full control over future developments and in two years time we have the opportunity to further exploit the fonts.\n\nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag\n\n"

Not sure how well that model would continue to work in the OpenType era.\n\nMy philosophy of font marketing (and digital ethics) changed considerably when I read Chris Anderson's essay on \"Free\" in Wired, although I haven't got around to incorporating my new attitude into any marketing plans yet.\n\n"

      "content": "Ok, two answers:  \nA download does not count as a license. The license talks of installation of 25 workstations. That means if you have the fonts installed on 75 workstations you are in defiance of the EULA, whether you downloaded the fonts once or a 100 times.\n\nThis is the typical Fontbook bug. It's been around for blimmin' ages and Apple (the lifestyle company) have done nothing to remedy it. This error occurs when TTF fonts are loaded with a missing 'fpgm' table. This table is necessary for hinted fonts but in unhinted fonts it has no effect whatsoever. You can safely ignore this warning. We ought to issue an update I guess.\n\nYou can only link for font styles together. The fonts are engineered so that the Bold can be accessed via the 'B' button in Office apps. That necessitates that the Light has to be separated into its own font family. The way the fonts are engineered at present give the most thorough formatting compatibility, accross platforms and documents possible.\n\nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag Ltd\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you all for your comments. I am pretty chuffed with the design myself.\n\nYes, hinting: the font has been autohinted but that, of course, won't do the trick if good display is required. If we get some spare time and don't know what to do with our hands, we'll do some hard core VTT hinting on it.\n\nTheunis, the font naming convention is intentional. This allows us the same naming for all applications, be they graphic or office. It also means that if a doc is created in one app, the doc can be opened, imported or whatever, in another wihtout losing the font name formatting. And since we're sticking with the 4-style font family it works fine in older versions of Win and Unix, too.\n\nI realise that this may be a bit tedious for graphics users where you'd expect to see all styles in one font family. But it is a small price to pay for all round compatibility.\n\nIt is our policy to give all glyphs a Unicode value. I realise that a number of these are then put on private area. Not everyone may agree with this policy but I believe it is important to give access to these glyphs also to people who have no OT feature access, such as Word. And since it's Unicode, the glyphs can also be accessed using database driven copy, as long as the Unicodes are stringed correctly.\n\nAnd then the question re TTF: it is our policy to produce TTF based OpenType fonts since we are confident that they work pretty reliably in a wide variety of environments. We create CFF based OT fonts only on demand.\n\nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag\n\n"

Oh well, I'll stick to (checking) hey, today it's Eurostile :-)\n\nIt sure looks to me as a very good book font -- I'm going to propose this to our clients. That's doctoral theses from our friendly local medicine university (Erasmus, Rotterdam) in small print runs (about 300), so don't expect to see one pop up in book stores near you soon.
