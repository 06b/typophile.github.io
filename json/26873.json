This   \nallows me to work faster. Your naming was already   \npretty clear, but sometimes we've got half a dozen   \nof threads saying _\"Please help me to identify this   \nfont\"_ , which is not very practical (and quite redundant   \nfor posts on this board: it's not like we're swapping   \nrecipes here).   \n ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20130707032743im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \n   \n_When I saw Mr Coles' and your name as moderators_   \n   \nStephen I understand, but I haven't quite made a name   \nfor myself outside this board.

Luckily I started going through the list before flaming away.   \n   \n2. well, we kinda met years ago, at the A-Type1 conference in Antwerp (93? 94?). I pretty much spent the whole weekend in the Typelab there. Mario Beernaert (remember TV27) got me there, with a couple of other students. I don't think I really spoke to you back then, apart from maybe asking the odd Fontographer question or some printer problem. ;-)   \nAs a customer of FS Belgium and reader of various FS publications, I obviously recognised your name when I saw it here.   \n   \nvoila. da's ook weer opgelost dan...\n\n"
