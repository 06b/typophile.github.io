I'd like to ask you to have a fresh look at it and let me know if my thinking is right :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120717153625im_/http:/typophile.com/files/phc_liga_before_6319.jpg)\n\nBecause of tight kerning the serif of the 'i' is very close to the 'r' and I'm not fond of the look of it. So I connected the glyphs (in small sizes the gap disappears anyway), trying not to destroy the shapes of the font (Malaga):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120717153625im_/http:/typophile.com/files/phc_liga_after_4184.jpg)\n\nDo you think it works? Can you think of a better solution maybe?\n\nThanks,  \nAleksander\n\n",

Skewing the glyph so that the spacing was good enough looked as if the “s” was becoming regular in between italic letters. I'll show other options too and hope for more comments :)\n\nHrant, as for the “t” I don't know - I think it is consistent with other letters. Or did you refer to something else? I like this warm and brush-stroke-like character of the typeface and while I agree to correct kerning and other optical problems I would prefer to leave the letters untouched. The designer of the typeface clearly spent his time making sure all the characters belong to the same family.\n\nAs for the “p” I could agree but shouldn't “h” be shortened accordingly? If so, shouldn't the dot of the “i” be lowered too?\n\nThe name PrintHouse is written as one word in all company's communication, as opposed to other print houses out there.\n\nThanks.\n\n"

Big difference. Some people even believe that leaving a font alone when making a logo is a sin of sorts.  \n3) You already modified the \"i\". And SKEWING?! :-) Plus you seem be open to modifying the vertical proportions, which affects a \"font\" (which like I said this no longer is anyway) massively.\n\nNow, if you prefer it like that, leave it alone, sure.\n\n\\> As for the “p” I could agree but shouldn’t “h” be shortened accordingly?  \n\\> If so, shouldn’t the dot of the “i” be lowered too?\n\nWell, I'm looking at how this thing is using the space, as well as letter confusability issues. Unless you remove the tittle (which I wouldn't advise) the ascender space is being used anyway and the \"h\" should take advantage, especially since its ascender keeps it from looking like an \"n\"; in contrast the \"p\" is sort of wasting the space below, and a short descender doesn't make it look like any other letter. BTW, even looking at this as a font I'd say the descender space is too much (because of letter frequencies in real text). In my book making the descenders exactly the same length as the ascenders (which looks like might be the case here) is a Modernist simpletonism.\n\n\\> The name PrintHouse is written as one word\n\nAh, but look at the useful capitalization (which you're not using). If they like it all-lc they might still be missing the fact that decipherability might suffer -if only slightly- when it's output in one color with no shading. But I'm really only talking about the absolute thinnest of wordspaces.\n\nhhp\n\n"
