Its gotta be very ornate, oppulent, luxurios etc. I'm trying something with letters that weave in and out of each other\n\nYou know, kind of like the TDC logo, but in a straight line. And a little more elegant.\n\nThe letters are \"PBS\"\n\nI started sketching the idea\n\nI originally was using baskerville, but its too heavy to properly interweave the characters with each other.\n\nAny advice?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [photo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131216050706/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_9.jpg) | 115.09 KB |\n\n",

So you are way out of line, paragraph.\n\nAndrew,  \nYou need a font with not to many thicks and thins and some jaunty serifs. A little of personality for each of them ideally. I would suggest you go find some examples of old wood type (think dada-esque) and just rifle through till you find \"the one\". I don't know where in your town you might be able to do that, but that's where you step in. Am I on the right track?\n\n"

This will give you a very old-school flavor, perhaps not what you're looking for.\n\nIn the original, there are lots of alternate characters and long extenders, but none for the caps P, B, and S specifically. In general, that kind of thing would make it easier to weave.\n\nProbably just a wacky idea, but maybe it leads you somewhere.\n\n"
