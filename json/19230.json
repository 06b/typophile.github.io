      "content": "He must have been my favourite designer when I was growing up, but I didn't know it till I read about him in Eye a few years ago.\n\nFirst, he designed \"Man Must Measure - the Wonderful World of Mathematics\" in 1955, which was a book that had a big influence on me at an early age. It didn't seem like maths at all, it was more like a colorful history of the world that was all pictures and diagrams, which I still remember, like the sun shinging down a well at the equator at midday, or how an abacus worked. I also recently discovered that Lancelot Hogben, who wrote it, was a Marxist, propagandist for progress -- those guys must have gotten inside my head. And then I was really into poetry when I was a teenager, and had all \"The Penguin Modern Poets\" with Facetti's covers. Funny, the covers were very mod, but the guts of the text was set in Monotype Bembo, a legacy from Tschicold's day.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621043119im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Roget.jpg)\n  \n1964.

In any case it must have been Hans Schmoller who did the design--St. Bride had an exibit on him last spring at Typotechnica. But a similar kind of thing, not exactly the same, was done by Tschichold, as I see in the Rauri McLean bio on him.\n\nWonderful stuff, the whole run of years of those Penguins.\n\nI guess what always attracted me particularly were the good looking covers that were purely typographic--no photos. These had a certain calm, literary quality that was lovely.\n\nThey weren't afraid of white space, or of type.\n\n"

Apparently they are from the Hans Schmoller era (post-1949). Powers also mentions that a German designer, Elisabeth Friedlander, created the pattern for one of the poetry covers he shows in his book, and adds that she began working for Penguin in 1948.\n\n"

      "content": "Hello folks, I’m new here (first post!) but I couldn’t resist commenting on the passing of Germano Facetti. Like Nick Shinn, it was his cover designs for Penguin, along with Penguin’s wonderful taste in typography, that awoke me to a love of books when I was a teenager. His cover designs for the Modern Classics series also introduced me to a lot of painters that, at that time, I hadn’t come across. Under his art direction Penguin seemed to be a repository for the best of European culture in the 20-th Century. I had — and still have — most of the Modern European Poets series and his Modern Classics series.\n\nI think it was under him that Penguin achieved true greatness, emerging from the austerity of the war years to present books as a passport to enlightened values. After 1980, or thereabouts, British book publishing lost its way and has never quite recovered, imho. So much that is produced there looks shoddily conceived and executed. But Germano Facetti was a light that shone in my teenage years and I owe him a debt of thanks for that.\n\nCheers to you all — this is a wonderful forum for the lover of type and print.\n\nEluard\n\n"

I started the thread, so I guess I should correct it. :-)\n\n(And from the evidence of the first few comments in this thread, I started out using the date of 1926, then had it changed to 1928 because of what I read in the British newspapers! Now I'm going to change it back.)\n\nThe Guardian's obituary still says 1928, if you look it up. The [Times obituary](http://web.archive.org/) also uses the 1928 date.\n\nI've just done a search on Google and found some articles that give 1926 as Facetti's date of birth:\n\n[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi\\_qn4159/is\\_20060416/ai\\_n16166320](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621043119/http:/findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20060416/ai_n16166320 \"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi\\_qn4159/is\\_20060416/ai\\_n16166320\")\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germano\\_Facetti](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621043119/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germano_Facetti \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germano\\_Facetti\")\n\nThe Wikipedia article helpfully lists \"sources citing 1926 as Facetti's year of birth, not 1928\"! This led me to the [Design Museum's page on Penguin Books](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621043119/http:/www.designmuseum.org/design/penguin-books):\n\n\"The rigorous application of colour, grid and typography in those early paperbacks instilled Penguin with a commitment to design from the start. The company then strengthened its design ethos under the direction of the German typographer Jan Tschichold (1902-1974) during the 1940s and the Italian art director Germano Facetti (1926-) in the 1960s.\"\n\n"
