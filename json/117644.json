      "content": "Thank you! I've compared it to Century 731, and it does look very close. There were different versions of Excelsior to which I compared it originally, and some had numerals that did seem to me to match, which is a reason I chose Excelsior over other members of the Legibility series.\n\nBut Century 731 is wider than Century Expanded, so my next question was, what is Century 731 really? So I did some Googling.\n\nParaType told me the face was part of the Legibility series, and originally designed by Chauncey Griffith.\n\nAnd then Identifont yielded the secret: Century 731 is Bitstream's version of Textype. (Chauncey H. Griffith, 1929.) So I'm going to check out the original, since Mechanix Illustrated was done on Linotype hot metal equipment, after all, which would account for small discrepancies from Bitstream's digitization.\n\nWell, I managed to hunt down at least one image that included a specimen of the original Textype; here's a piece taken from that image:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317125043im_/http:/typophile.com/files/textype_5128.jpg)\n\nAnd here's some more Textype, with a lot of digits:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317125043im_/http:/typophile.com/files/textype_digits_5627.jpg)\n\nThe second sample, though, seems to have a smaller x-height than the first, as well as being a better match. However, I did come across a source that mentioned that there was a \"book\" version of Textype as well as the \"newspaper\" version of it, so I could well have encountered both in that case.\n\n"
