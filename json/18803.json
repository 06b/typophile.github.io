One of my high school teachers knew Chris Buckley personally, and every year, after he made us read the book, would get the class artist (guess who it was my year?) make him a poster. So I like to think that somewhere in his house is a very creative cigarette (I rolled mine up, clever clever).\n\nWe almost crossed paths again when Mr. Buckley was the guest on the Colbert Report when I saw it taped a couple of weeks ago.\n\nHowever, the movie was a bit of a letdown for me (aside from the titles), only because I knew the book so well. The person I saw it with assured me that it was enjoyable and they hadn’t read the book, but I urge you all to do so. It’s much more... I won’t say because I don’t want to spoil anything, but the book is excellent.\n\nSorry, I had to get that off my chest. Love the titles. I bet whoever made them had fun.\n\n"
