  "content": "This typeface is based on the notion of suggestion vs. statement, and testing the boundaries of legibility and practicality. The goal is to achieve a subtle, elusive quality, while remaining somewhat comprehensible.   \nI'm also intrigued by the eye's automatic ability to connect un-connected marks, for example, lines to dots, etc.   \nI still have some unresolved issues with line variance, and possibly spacing, both of which can be fixed.   \n   \nI appreciate any and all feedback offered. Bring it.   \n   \nMerci.   \n ![One curtail](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021014927im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7431.gif) ![One Bold Curtail](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021014927im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7432.gif)\n\n",
