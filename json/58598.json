Organon Sans will have the same six weights, have same stem thickness and x-heights as the corresponding Serifs.\n\nIf you compare character shapes of Sans and Serif you can see they are not always the same, but there is a familial resemblance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414164344im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Organon-S+S_6676.gif)\n\n",

I prefere the round start of the \"d\".  \nI realise now that you had this difference in the serif, were it works quite well, still i'm not fond of this \"style\" in sans serifs, for me it always looks too hard.  \nAlso, what about an old style \"g\"?\n\n"

Maybe it the top could be raised a hair, or the inside contour could flare a touch more, or something?\n\nJust curious, did you try a Kk with a horizontal connector?\n\n"
