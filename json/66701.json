What do people generally use it for?\n\n(2)I want to set a letter in Minion Pro. Should I use the standard or the medium weight, or can I opt for either one?\n\nThanks!\n\nJurriaan\n\n",

That will look quite similar to regular set black on white, while regular looks too light. Another use is when printing on cheap paper.\n\n2. I'd use regular. But there are no rules. Try both, and see what's most pleasing and readable.\n\n"
