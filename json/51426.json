  "content": "I have been redesigning my logo and landed on your site when searching for fonts similar to Eternity. Some of the posters here turned me on to Bayer Architype, but I also learned that the Foundry is non-responsive to queries. [http://typophile.com/node/1560](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020202734/http:/typophile.com/node/1560) and [http://typophile.com/node/10870](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020202734/http:/typophile.com/node/10870).\n\nAll I wanted to do was test-drive the font to see if it was worth considering, purchasing and felt frustrated at this obstacle. I discovered something that may be of use to future seekers/posters and wanted to pay back the informational favor.\n\nThere is a .svg file posted on Wikipedia that has all of the Bayer Architype letterforms in outline mode. This provided me with a useful tool to test drive the font. I thought others might benefit as well. The link is: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BayerArch.svg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020202734/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BayerArch.svg).\n\nI have decided not to use this font after all for this particular redesign so I won't have to chase Foundry at this point. I am still torn between Eternity and Function Condensed Bold but the design is evolving nicely.\n\nSo, a big thanks to those who posted info on Typophile forums that helped me in my quest.\n\n",
