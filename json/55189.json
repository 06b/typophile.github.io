Whatever the case, I wanna recreate it in Adobe... Arial in adobe is anti-aliased and clean as can be.. not the look I need.\n\nAm I correct on the ID of types like this? Let me who you what I mean.\n\nEven the \"loading data\" text uses it. The type in this site. What am I not finding?\n\n[http://kashiwasato.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120717131112/http:/kashiwasato.com/ \"http://kashiwasato.com/\")?\n\n",
