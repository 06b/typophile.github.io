  "content": "Hi I am relatively new to design and am looking at setting up a layout. I can get my baselines to sit on a top and bottom margin by calculation and leading. But then When I go to create guides in indesign and set the number of rows (NOT columns) to 8 the and I need a gap of 12pt (4.223) between the fields. The baseline and the gaps between the fields do not line up.\n\nI am aware that you need to calculate this properly to get it right but is there a tried and tested way of calculating this to get it right.Cam anyone help?\n\nMany Thanks\n\nJames\n\n [‹ Web design business logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080304023403/http:/typophile.com/node/42593 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Unexpected Combinations? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080304023403/http:/typophile.com/node/42601 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Or are you trying to set the baseline grid?\n\nIf it’s to set the baseline grid, go to: Edit\\>Preferences\\>Grids. You’ll have inputs for where you want to Start/Offset the baseline grid and if it’s Relative to the Top of Page or the Top Margin, then you’ll get to set the Incrementation (you can input 12pts or whatever your leading is.) Honestly, I’m not sure what View Threshold is, but I have mine set for 100%. Turn Baseline Grids on View\\>Grids & Guides\\>Show Baseline Grid\n\n"

      "content": "My math is a little backward, but anyway:\n\nYour number lines in a column, minus the number of horizontal lines between the rows, must be a number divisible by the number of rows. For example, if you have 51 lines and 4 rows, you’ll need to subtract 3 extra rows to get 48 lines, which is divisible by 4. If you have 53 lines and subtract 3 extra rows you’re left with 51 lines, which will not divide evenly, so you will need to either increase or decrease column height to make it work.\n\n[Muller-Brockman explains it better than I do.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080304023403/http:/www.amazon.com/Systems-Graphic-Design-Josef-Muller-Brockmann/dp/3721201450/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204215667&sr=8-2)\n\n"
