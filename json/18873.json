  "content": "Hi!\n\nI’m trying to track down this font (script) even though I think it may be a custom font. The closest I could find was Dear Sarah but that is more oblique/slanted than I would like. Any recommendations for other typefaces with this organic/handcrafted type of feel? I have looked at the following: Olduval, Galahad, Baker Script, Modern Blues, Sunshine and Tree. Basically, I am looking for a font to serve as a starting point for a logo for a handmade jewelery (beads, etc.) company.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nJosh\n\n [‹ Substitue for Gotham.](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104233023/http:/typophile.com/node/19442 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font for my Blog ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104233023/http:/typophile.com/node/19413 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
