  "content": "The inserted image is the text below a 19th century painting of a comet above a Czech town that appeared in a Czech journal or magazine. I intend to enlarge it, print it (fine art quality on quality paper), and frame it - the image quality/resolution will allow this. However, the text quality is poor and enlargement will only make it worse, as we all know. I tried unsuccessfully to find the font in order to re-type it by posting it on multiple font ID sites/forums. There were several close suggestions but the numerals never matched and this was a problem because I'm quite fond of those characters, in particular. Then one sharp-eyed professional pointed out that this text was almost surely hand-lettered, not type set, because similar characters have too much variation from one to another. So, I'm wondering how much trouble it would be to make a font based on this hand lettering in order to retype it under the image in acceptable quality? I have limited experience in this field (OK, almost none at all). I hear/read that Scanfont might be a solution? If this route is the one to take, could I just make a limited font with only the '1', '5', and '8' numerals that I can not find matches for, to use mixed with one of the suggested fonts that otherwise does closely match? If this is a good solution and anyone is up to the task, please contact me (I would be wiling to pay a reasonable fee for services rendered). Although this is not a 'font ID' query, if anyone knows of a font that matches those numeral, I'm obviously all ears. Likewise, other creative solutions to this problem. Thanks.\n\n-MG\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820174645im_/http:/typophile.com/files/text_5990.jpg)\n\n",
