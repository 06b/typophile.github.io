  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking for a headline font for the magazine I'm working for. They need a font that has at least 3 different cuts and that is trendy and not old fashioned (the topic is the futur men's fashion). But I'm not looking for another techno font! I've already checked my principal foundries : Typecuts, Village, Emigre, Font Bureau, House Industry, Lineto, Optimo, P22, Process Type Foundry, Hoefler & Frere-Jones and Underware, so I've got quite a lot fonts now but I want to make sure that I haven't forgotten a great contemporary headline font from a foundry that I don't know so far... So if you guys have some suggestions or already used an incredible font that is matching with what I want, please let me know!\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
