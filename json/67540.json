  "content": "Sometime ago, I saw a typeface designed by Elias Bitencourt, named [Tex](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317231055/http:/typophile.com/node/29444). I then went over to fontstruct and started designing a typeface that worked in similar ways to Tex. In a sense, it's very similar, with some gliphs, like the 'a' being almost copies from Tex. But it was a typeface I very much liked, and I though about designing one with the same principles, and following a basic set of rules.  \nThe result so far is [Godric](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317231055/http:/fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/287858).  \nI'd like some input on this, from you guys, which I regard as being the best way to learn, from commentaries from people that work with type constantly.  \nI'm also saving some kind of specimen on the attachment, but you can download the type from fontstruct. It has some kerning issues, and I intend to work that out after finishing the rest of the glyphs, on an open version of this.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Godricspecimen18-02-2010.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317231055/http:/typophile.com/files/Godricspecimen18-02-2010_0.pdf) | 11.42 KB |\n\n",
