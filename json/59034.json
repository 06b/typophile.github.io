  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nA client has sent me a packaging task that was previously created in Illustrator by another designer.  \nSaid designer has converted all type to shapes, and I can therefore not edit or ID this specific font.\n\nIt \\*looks\\* to me like FuturaBT. What do you say?\n\nIf anyone knows where I may be able to obtain FuturaBT fonts (preferably for free), can you kindly point me in the right direction?\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415231542/http:/typophile.com/files/font_136.jpg) | 74.66 KB |\n\n",
