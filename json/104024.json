Transat Text has a slightly taller x-height than its counterpart, as well as more rationalized character widths, shorter descenders and fewer design eccentricities, making it easier to read in text settings. While designed to shine in paragraphs, it also performs admirably in larger display settings.\n\nTransat Text includes many OpenType features, such as ligatures, small capitals, case sensitive forms, stylistic alternates, arbitrary fractions, and a full complement of proportional, tabular, and oldstyle figures. With nearly 700 glyphs, it provides support for most European languages. The Transat Text family includes 5 weights plus optically-corrected obliques.\n\n**Transat Text** is currently available at [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174428/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetanic-fonts/transat-text/?refby=typetanic), [YouWorkForThem](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174428/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/font/T4497/transat-text?affId=160188), and [Creative Market](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174428/http:/crtv.mk/dLKX). For a limited time, you can get the full family of 10 fonts for just **$30**.\n\n",

While the combo deal is no longer available, Transat Text is still available for $30 through August 3.\n\n"

I like the slight quirk that it gives the finished face and it also seems to add some motion to hyphenated words.\n\nI don't have any alternates for the hyphen, though all the dashes are the standard horizontal style.\n\n"

I only said FontBureau because Kent's name escaped me for the moment and I only remembered the publisher. Generally if I know their name I do credit the designer when mentioning other typefaces.\n\n"
