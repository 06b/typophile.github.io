  "content": "Hello all,\n\nMy new typeface Soho Gothic was released this week.  \nI did a promotional animation intro which you can  \nsee here, along with a comprehensive pdf:\n\n[www.monotypefonts.com/sg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014000841/http:/www.monotypefonts.com/sg \"www.monotypefonts.com/sg\")\n\nPress release [here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014000841/http:/www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/pr_display.aspx?year=2008&pr=456)\n\nThanks.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Höfe. Yes, the promo isn't a showcase. It's supposed to be a striking,  \ncinematic introduction/teaser. The intention is it makes an impression,  \nbecause it's unusual, and generates interest from a wider range of web sites.  \nToo early to say whether it's working but wanted to try something different.\n\nThe pdf shows of the design well, I hope, and has some notes at the back.  \nObviously the press release has information relating to the design.  \nAnything else you want to know just ask.\n\n\\>I’d love to hear what your main inspiration & references were!\n\nHi Kris. In some respects it's like Neo Sans, which I designed,  \nwith the curves taken out. Not all the curves obviously.  \nThat would be hideous, but enough to make the design a bit  \nmore versatile I think.\n\nSo the same things that influenced Neo. Gerard Unger's  \nexcellent open designs like Argo, Dave Farey's Cachet, etc.  \nIt's more industrial looking than the former and less curvy  \nthan the latter.\n\n"
