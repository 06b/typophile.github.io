      "content": "I think this is an interesting idea - I'm personally very interested in seeing how anthropomorphism can be incorporated into type. But there's one key thing I think you're missing: for it to work it has to be very very subtle. As a designer it's hard to restrain one's abilities to implement an idea as strongly as possible - but controlling what people _won't_ see is fundamental. I would suggest starting by taking an \"elemental\" font (I like to use Lucida) and seeing how you can bend it to convey something - not convey literally, but more implicitly.   \n   \nThe other thing is that the thinner your strokes the more you're limiting the smallest size the font can actually be used at.   \n   \nBTW, it's not easy making a descender-less font - look at Hobo for some inspiration. (Any others, guys? And gals? :-)   \n   \n--   \n   \nThe \"snap-on\" stuff is cool. It seems to go way beyong anything like it I've seen (including Carter's Walker), by letting you add things like stroke contrast - pretty ingenious.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Basically you could make any sort of add-ons (with shapes assigned to keystrokes), and as long as you maintain the advance-widths of the base glyphs you can overlay them nicely.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
