We’ll meet again soon!\n\nGreat seeing & meeting those who did come out - and thanks Eben for the restaurant recommendation, it was great!\n\n"

It was good see everyone again and to meet you Eben, Grant and Shu for the first time.\n\nStefan, you were missed. Hopefully I’ll get to see you before you return home and perhaps Rod could be cajoled into coming out to play too. There was talk last night of putting together an east bay typophile gathering sometime soon. Anyone want to suggest a date?\n\n"
