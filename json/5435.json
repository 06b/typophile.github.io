  "content": "Hi, I'm in the somewhat unenviable position of having to reproduce the Texas Heat Wave bit of this graphic. They were supposed to supply this to me, but they seem to have forgotten or something. Please help me identify the font that's been manipulated here so that I can do my best to remanipulate it in similar fashion.   \n   \nthanks,   \nAlex ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019011357im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39672.gif)\n\n",

However, I'm doing some freelance webmastering in Texas so I have sort of an electric toe in those waters. And thank goodness I'm working with people in Austin.   \n   \nAnyway, please, if anyone can identify a font (any font) that approximates this thing (with its' S and W especially), I'd be much obliged.   \n   \nThis is a request that will stop being relevant tomorrow afternoon, for reasons of deadlines, etc.   \n   \nThanks\n\n"

      "content": "This looks custom drawn. I think it's extremely unlikely to be a font. Notice how the E's and A's differ and how the shadow changes in the two T's.   \n   \nIf you need to re-create it, they don't come any easier than this. It's all straight lines. If you are handy with Illustrator (or something similar) it shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes to do. Just paste your sample into the background, zoom in, and connect the dots.\n\n"
