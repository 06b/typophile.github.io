Have you tried using a smoother script or something a little lighter? I feel like the cursive shouldn't take over the card as much as it does.\n\nOn a different note: the cursive \"ferrell\" is lost when viewed as it is. I just thought they were squiggles. Maybe do the common-sense thing and put \"erin\" at the top and \"ferrell\" at the bottom both right-side up?\n\n"
