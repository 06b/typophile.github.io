      "content": "First of all, I think it looks like it is a font, in spite of the fact that it has two different l’s, for example. Those differences could be ligatures. The only similar font I can think of is [Quattr’occhi](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603035526/http:/www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/RE10222) from 2Rebels. The font looks like it was designed on an ’Etch-a-Sketch’ toy, and so does your sample.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
