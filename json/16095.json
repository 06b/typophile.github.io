  "content": "Using some specs I’ve found on this site I’ve setup an Illustrator file to create my characters and then cut/paste them into FontLab. Works, however...\n\nFor instance, on the letter ’l’ (like a script l), the widths of my bowl (terminology?) at the left and right are not equal. They are in Illustrator (checked and double checked). It’s a modern script so we’re not talking any form of curves here.\n\nI don’t know if this is some quirk with cut/paste, FontLab or what?\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks...\n\n [‹ going bald!

Generally, digital fonts (PostScript, TrueType or OpenType) can only include integer coordinates. On the other hand, your Illustrator artwork can have nodes with non-integer coordinates such as 161.352 pt or 354.78 mm. When FontLab imports a drawing, it has to round them to integer values — because it cannot generate fonts with non-integer coordinates._ [Adam Twardoch](http://web.archive.org/web/20081209044850/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adam%252BTwardoch)\n\n"

I work with Illustrator since the first version (Illustrator 88, over 15 years) and it’s a wonderfull drawing software to create lots of things like illustration, graphs, charts, and so on, but FL has an advance over Illustrator to create typeface.\n\n"
