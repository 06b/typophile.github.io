It looks similar to FIAT headlines (I´ve checked at FIAT web page but there are some diferences) The M: this one has flat top, the middle vertex goes to the base and the vertex is pointed (FIAT M has pointed top and vertex and this last does not go to base) The E: the central bar is centered (in FIAT the central bar is below centre. The D, P, R, G and S are pretty equal to FIAT. Any suggestion? Thanks in advanc again.\n\n"
