  "content": "The company I work for is trying to move our work flow from Quark 5.01 to 7.x. In order to stay up to date with the current Quark release we need to upgrade all of our XP machines to service pack 2. When I do this it causes 2 separate(perhaps related) problems.\n\nThe first is with Quark 5. When sending pages(.eps files) to our RIPs they error out with a font not found error, using courier. This only happens after the sp2 install. These machines will print fine on sp1 or earlier. After troubleshooting with the RIP vendor, the only files that error out this way are .eps and from quark and they suggest we contact Quark(which is the last thing I want to do). All other programs can send to the RIPs without error including CS2. If we convert the .eps to a .pdf it outputs fine as well. Also replacing the Type 1 fonts in the files with OT fonts will stop the output error from occurring.\n\nThe second problem is with Quark 7.3 and newer. Quark will send pages normally until we do the update from 7.2 to 7.3x. The RIP outputs an error of:\n\nPainting separation “Black” to disk...  \nPage buffer size: Raw - 23.6Mb, Compressed - 120Kb, Ratio - 201.48:1  \nPrint time: 0 seconds  \nTotal time: 3 seconds  \n%%[Error: typecheck; OffendingCommand: restore; File: %ip:Film2%]%%  \n%%[Flushing: rest of job (to end of file) will be ignored]%%  \nJob Not Completed: f friday AM:j friday am shift.qxd.qxd\n\nIt’s always a typecheck error with the OffendingCommand sometimes different.\n\nAny input would be appreciated as I would rather not fix these issues with a broad swipe when it could be a minor detail we are missing. I apologize in advance if this post ends up not being related to a Type issue.\n\n [‹ FontLab Question](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207040806/http:/typophile.com/node/45811 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Unicode Private use advice ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207040806/http:/typophile.com/node/45769 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
