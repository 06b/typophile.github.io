  "content": "Hello.\n\nI'm in the middle of designing a book on the roots of creativity and thinking of setting it in Aldus. The character and the feel is good but the whole thing seems a little tight. Of course it's less efficient than setting in Bembo for example but the book isn't really heavy, like a novel, it's more illustrative. I may have to track it out a little to get a better flow. Yes I've looked at Palatino light but I hate it.\n\nAnyone had experience in using vast amounts of Aldus?\n\nThanks, James.\n\n",

As well as giving a nod to authenticity it offers a subtle difference against the text without being a world apart or stepping too close, I like the differences between the two.  \nGranted, Palatino Nova looks nice in print, but I think the way they are brought closer together with Nova wouldn't work for me.  \nAs for lengthening the ascenders myself... it's a time issue, the 'f' would be especially difficult.\n\nAm I arguing myself into a corner here.\n\n"

Aldus was my cheat for text, I used Palatino for Bold, and display. If I were doing the same job now, and had free rein, I would use a contemporary face. Seria, perhaps, has a similar cut and proportion.\n\n"
