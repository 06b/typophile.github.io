  "content": "(Excuse the cross-post with the OpenType mailing list)\n\nWe are compiling a list of fonts for simple writing systems (e.g. Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, etc.) which make at least some use of GPOS contextual positioning. For example, you might be using the relatively new ability of the AFDKO to do contextual kerning, or be doing an equivalent sort of thing using VOLT.\n\n“Contextual kerning” would be kern triplets and the like. For example, You might kern “V.” one way but “V.V” differently so the period is neatly between the two V’s and the two V’s don’t collide with each other.\n\nCan anyone who has made such fonts let me know, either here or by email? Note that I’m only interested in fonts that have shipped or will actually ship, that we might encounter in the field.\n\nThanks,\n\nT\n\n [‹ URGENT HELP NEEDED: 2 ALPHABETS FOR A TYPEFACE](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828002042/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43619 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Your kerning method ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828002042/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43656 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I. e. a ’mark’ anchor point is used to position the mark itself, but the base character, when combined with a mark, should be shifted a bit to right, so that the resulting combination looks more or less the same as the corresponding precomposed character.\n\nSee for example my [OldStandard](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828002042/http:/www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/fonts.html) font family. Note that the fonts are created with FontForge, which has a very good support for contextual lookups.\n\n"

Or is the contextual GPOS adjustment the only thing that operates on that glyph in that context?\n\n(I’m hoping that question makes sense!)\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"
