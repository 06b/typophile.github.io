In the introduction, Felici explains that it is a guide to 'execution' and not a style guide. Throughout it's pages, he uses limited illustrations to explain such topics as the correct 'color' of a block of text, appropriate use of Small Caps, Tracking and Kerning, Managing Indentation and Alignment, Special Characters and Special Situations , Document Styles and Typopraphic Conventions, Tables and Language Specific Issues rounded off by a comprehensive glossary of typographic terms to make what is arguably the best technical reference manual on Typography to date.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140112120649im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FeliciCMT_6421.jpg)\n\n",
