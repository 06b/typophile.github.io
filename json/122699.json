      "content": "You're right about OS 8. I had a demo of Ikarus-M around that time but had quite a few problems with it so abandoned it. I don't think the software is available any longer since URW++ sells the DTL FontMaster software these days.\n\nDutch Type Library's FontMaster is based on Ikarus and is available for modern operating systems. They have a free light version if you want to try it out. It runs on the Mac under Wine.  \n [http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317233012/http:/www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/ \"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/\")\n\n"
