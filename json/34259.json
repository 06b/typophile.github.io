  "content": "Hi there!\n\nI'm sure, this had been asked a lot of times before : )\n\nIt's about the pricing for a corporate headline font ( three styles, three weights ) for a european TV channel.\n\nSo, how much can I call? I have to submit an »exclusive« and a »not exclusive« offer. Is there a big difference, anyways?\n\nWhat do you think? Please help me with some figures.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJui\n\n",

      "content": "In my view the numbers are always too variable to discuss reliably. The amount of detail you would need to provide on the client and the project at hand for people to really help you with the numbers is very likely to piss off your client!\n\nIn terms of exclusivity versus not, the difference is proportional to how much you can sell the design via retail yourself. Over time this is generally not negligible; also, the perceived difference can be used to manage the price negotiation, for example by giving the client a chance to fall back on a less expensive option than full exclusivity, without running away outright. But if you think the sort of design they'll end up happy with won't sell well in the open market, try to sell them perpetual exclusivity. In any case though, unless there's a specific technical issue that no existing font in the market addresses, <cite>some</cite> exclusivity is only logical, otherwise their competitor(s) can buy the font retail and sabotage them.\n\nIn fact this \"some exclusivity\" tends to make great sense because clients like this only need the \"novelty effect\" for a while, maybe 2 or 3 years. Such a scheme is common, and can strike the best balance for both parties.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Your specifics may vary.\n\n"
