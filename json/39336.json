Yes, [its italic is quite different](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906231027/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/eldorado_text_italic/?sample_text=abcefgvwxy&sample_size=60&acs_p=1&acs_pt=24&acs=1), but at least the [italic (small) cap x has a cross-bar](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906231027/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/eldorado_text_italic_sc/?sample_text=abcefgvwxy%20X&sample_size=60), too.\n\n"

I am researching a lot but I don’t see some similar font.  \nFlorian, this font isn’t a digital font. It’s a analogic typeface:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906231027im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/image_3_metal_6339.JPG)\n\nDan Reynolds, I visited the site [http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Eldorado/styles](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906231027/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Eldorado/styles \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Eldorado/styles\") and saw the ’similar’ font, but it’s not equal.\n\nThank all you. I will consider — formal non-connected script, presumably called El Dorado. I go on researching and who found out other informations, I would like to know\n\n:)\n\n"
