It's not black and white (the classic) but here's one I did a while back in Illustrator:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120718145923im_/http:/typophile.com/files/illustartor-op-art-3_6700.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "As for your example, Martin, I would start off with concentric circles & just add filter after filter untill you've achieved the result you want. Twist it, use the free transform tool to nudgde it a little, maybe bloat the whole thing up a little... Play around & you could come across some very surprising and nice results.\n\n"
