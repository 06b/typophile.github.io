  "content": "This is for a new nursery starting up in Vermont. They’re aiming for the high-end market, by which I mean large, older trees. This means that I needed to find something classy, timeless, and also that I have something like ten years to come up with a good design.\n\nI started out trying to incorporate an acorn or an oak leaf or a tree or something iconic. The acorn I couldn’t get to not look stupid, a partial oak leaf I couldn’t get to not look like a Far Side character in profile, and the tree just looked trite. Also, various attempts at “classy” fonts seemed to be quickly dated.\n\nSo I wound up with just this, which is one of the Fell typeface-lookalikes from Igino Marini and one of its flowers. I think it captures a colonial Vermont feel without being too dated. But is it too bland; i.e., does it need a graphic? Thoughts? Suggestions? General comments? Thanks in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203190037im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/ecn_6702.png)\n\n [‹ Corporate logo for M&SS](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203190037/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38700 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [A company named Techlink ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203190037/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39037 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "High end & hand made really go together. Gorey is right in the sense that his letters were neo-conservative in inspiration if not in execution. It’s a conservative landed class thing you are wanting to tap into here. And Gorey is right because his stuff was hand made. But it is wrong in the sense that decrepitude and whimsy enter into it. That’s why I think hand lettering could get you what you want. Or in a pinch the right Caslon might do. Or very early Dutch type. You might look at the heavy weight of Amalia too. It isn’t down the path I have described but it might be a surprisingly good fit. You can find Amalia here:\n\n[http://www.ourtype.be/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203190037/http:/www.ourtype.be/ \"http://www.ourtype.be/\")\n\n"
