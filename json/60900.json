  "content": "From one to the other moment it seems something very strange happened to my vfb files. Since today I cannot install the OpenType fonts on my Windows XP system which I'm problemless generating in FontLab Studio 5. It says (somewhat translated from Dutch): \"can't install the typeface (OpenType). Perhaps the font file is damaged. Aks a new one from your vendor.\" Going back to a vfb file from a few days ago and again generate a font without any problem does allow me to install the font. It seems a bug or something the like has invisibly nestled in my working files.\n\nClearing/Deleting windows' font cache as well as rebooting certain times didn't help. Using the .bak files either. Any thoughts?\n\nFingers crossed...\n\n",

Sometimes, generating a PS Type 1 font, then opening it up in FontLab takes care of the problem, but sometimes it doesn't. In such cases, if I generate a TrueType font and open it, the problem goes away, but then you have to change the curves back to OpenType curves and, occasionally, some losses occur...\n\n"
