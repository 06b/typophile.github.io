      "content": "Beyond typefaces designed with specific trends in mind like you mentioned, I don't know that any specific font would really say 1990... You could just pick a great typeface that was designed in the 90s. Perhaps a Zuzana Licko or Jonathan Barnbrook typeface.\n\nI think the closest you're going to get is a typeface of the post modern movement or beginning of the digital era. It's hard to say since I don't know what the project is, but perhaps it'll be more about how you set the type than the actual typeface. If you want to pick an iconic 90s designer, it seemed like David Carson cared very little about typeface he was using and more about how it was arranged on a page.\n\n———————————————————-  \n [Read Between the Leading podcast](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044202/http:/rbtl.us/) | [Pixelspread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044202/http:/pixelspread.com/)\n\n"
