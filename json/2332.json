  "content": "I'm trying to generate some PDF files from Microsoft Word. The font we use is Luc(as) de Groot's CorpidOffice. We don't have a PDF license for it, so I don't want to/can't embed the font in the PDFs. I'd be happy to let them appear in Adobe Sans. But the problem it, no matter what I do, the font is embeded. I tried generating a PS file first, then distill without the font activated, or adding CorpidOffice to the 'never embed' list, but apprantly the font is always included when Word generates the PS file. Any ideas?\n\n",
