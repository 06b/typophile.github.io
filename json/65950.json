And are there any similar, free versions of this type of fontface floating around?\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306061231/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_335.png) | 64.19 KB |\n| [Picture 2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306061231/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_186.png) | 18.63 KB |\n\n",
