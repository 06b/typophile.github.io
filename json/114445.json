The geometry of the inline in your sample matches that of Trogman's other face, Yagi double, which leads me to think it's probably based on Blippo rather than Pump. There are several digital incarnations of Blippo around, but I've not previously seen or heard of an inline version. This may have been done as a custom job.\n\n"
