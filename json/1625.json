Britain has 2m severe dyslexics, including 375,000 schoolchildren. Frensch has designed Read, a sans serif typeface she hopes will help people to read and write more clearly. It works because each letter is drawn individually. She has produced a limited edition book that explains how she did it and why and hopes to sell the typeface via a website, [www.readregular.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123007/http:/www.readregular.com/) (which has yet to be set up). For individuals, it will be 'the price of a CD', while bigger corporations will have to pay accordingly. There is also a version for children.
