      "content": "Joanna is a great looking typeface, and one of the most original serifs produced in XX century typography, but I doubt that, as often happens, its digital rendition can reach the true spirit of the original metal. It is already been stressed by someone else in this forum, but a great contemporary and very well-working typeface which somehow resembles the shapes of Joanna (without the idiosyncracies and faults of the digital version) is Whitman by Kent Lew, a font which I’ve used in setting books and that I find particulary helpful in running text and even in covers, when set at big sizes.\n\n[http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmanOverview.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20091003024426/http:/www.kentlew.com/WhitmanOverview.html \"http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmanOverview.html\")\n\nAnd speaking of typeface for books: I’m currently using Cycles, by Sumner Stone, one of the few successful achievement in digital typography in recent years. Apart from being so nicely executed and drawned, Cycles is available in various sizes, from 5 to 36, so it is very helpful for “complex book typography”, when you need the right font weight for the main text, the titles, the footnotes, etc. Once you’ll start using Cycles, you’ll forget most of the serifs you’ve used before.\n\n[http://stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20091003024426/http:/stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html \"http://stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html\")\n\n"
