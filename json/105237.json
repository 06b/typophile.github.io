  "content": "Dears,\n\nI used all the online tools available to detect this font. The closest match i have found is font named COMB.  \nFor Uppercase letters it looks like as comb. But for lowercase letters COMB uses sans (dashes in letters: i, l etc)  \nSo, basically i am having troubles with lowercase letters.\n\nThe image is from betting receipt in Turkey. A government owned lottery for football. I believe this is some kind of special font. Any help would be highly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [iphone2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419080559/http:/typophile.com/files/iphone2_0.jpg) | 1.42 MB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hello urfan.alimov,\n\nThe logotype \"iddaa\" looks to be [Helvetica Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419080559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/) or a variant of it such [Helvetica Neue Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419080559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/). It's not perfectly printed, but that's the most probable typeface chosen.\n\nThe body text is a tough one. I ran it through [Identifont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419080559/http:/www.identifont.com/similar?2LA) and that is the best result from my findings on there. It's a proportional, san-serif typeface typical of a receipt that's all I can see from it something similar to this imitation called [Merchant Copy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419080559/http:/www.fontspace.com/cumberland-fontworks/merchant-copy). I have also done some good, old Googling and encounter this [thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419080559/http:/graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/20027/identify-these-fonts-used-on-receipts) on the graphics forum of the Stack Exchange. Have a read, it appears to suggest a font called [Hypermarket](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419080559/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/green-type/hypermarket/), which looks close to your receipt.\n\n-Inferno986return-\n\n"
