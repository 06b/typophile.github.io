  "content": "Hi Guys,\n\nGo easy on me here, as I admit I am a beginner. However, I have just spent around 300 hours and 8 weeks working on my first type family. It’s been absolutely pain staking work, but now it’s complete I think it’s worth it. Have and look and let me know if you like it, It’s been accepted by T26, but again I am a beginner learning a new craft, so please go easy on me :D\n\nHad some problems uploading it, so I will have to link to it unfortunately,\n\n[http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Hirukoa-Type-Family/125049](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819214510/http:/www.behance.net/Gallery/Hirukoa-Type-Family/125049 \"http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Hirukoa-Type-Family/125049\")\n\nThanks,  \nAlex.\n\n",
