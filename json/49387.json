With a neutral design Alto is well attuned to the needs of day-to-day designing without adding too much flavour. It offers extensive language support and a wide range of typographic features to meet even the most demanding design briefs.  \nAvailable in nine weights of roman and italic designs, the Alto family is built around four widths – normal, condensed, extra condensed, and monospaced – making it OurType’s largest sanserif font family to date. Available in OpenType STD and PRO, covering Basic Latin and Latin Extended character sets.\n\n**[Lirico](http://web.archive.org/web/20081211104847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lirico) –  \na fine text family**    \n [Hendrik Weber](http://web.archive.org/web/20081211104847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hendrik%252BWeber)’s Lirico is a characterful, contemporary text face that is at once elegant and sturdy, charming and reliable. Specifically designed for texts, Lirico is unabashedly traditional yet pleasantly up-to-date. Its qualities will delight graphic designers and experienced typographers alike.  \nThe Lirico family consists of roman and italic designs in six weights.  \nAvailable in OpenType STD and PRO, covering Basic Latin and Latin Extended character sets.\n\n**[Meran](http://web.archive.org/web/20081211104847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Meran) –  \na unique contemporary sanserif**    \nDesigned by [Maurice Göldner](http://web.archive.org/web/20081211104847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Maurice%252BG%2525C3%2525B6ldner), Meran is a contemporary sanserif with a fresh and distinctive look that we might call a ‘contemporary rotunda’. Impressive in display sizes and inviting to read in text sizes, Meran is a sanserif with an edge, which offers an exceptional blend between character and utility.  \nThe Meran family consists of six weights of roman and italic designs. To offer additional choice and flexibility, the Meran family is built around three widths: normal, semi condensed and condensed. The semi condensed has been specially developed for font sizes above 14 point. Meran is available in OpenType STD and PRO, covering Basic Latin and Latin Extended character sets.\n\n**About Thomas Thiemich**  \n<cite> Thomas Thiemich is a typographic designer, fascinated by analytics, logic, mathematics and physics.
