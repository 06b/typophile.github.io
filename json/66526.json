I thought the letterforms of [Chit-chat](http://web.archive.org/web/20130906080331/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/jonahfonts/chit-chat/) from JonahFonts looked intriguingly similar (if you slant them), especially when looking at more fonts from his (John Nahmias's) collection. The way some letters are made seems like your sample, but I admit it may just be how casual lettering like this would be drawn by many people.\n\nMy suspicion is that this may be a custom font, since it is an easy style to create.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
