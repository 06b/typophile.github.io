This laywer company is named CAPA that stands for the K word in Portuguese. Now I have some problems on the original concept. Tell me where makes more sense to you the type position. Should I only stick with the SERIF and drops Avenir for the description? Please be free to try other positions ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020193312im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nThanks, I'll show the full ID after finish the logo.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020193312im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22390.gif) ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020193312im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22391.gif) ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020193312im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22392.gif) ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020193312im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22393.gif) ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020193312im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22394.gif)\n\n",
