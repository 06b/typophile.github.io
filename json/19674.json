I didn't want the first time i ever posted to be about Arial of all things, but what can you do?\n\nWe have a client that needs Arial in semi-bold form, but from what i (think) i know, Arial Semi-Bold doesn't exist. You can almost mimic what it would look like by applying a faux bold to the regular font, but that's not going to help the client.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThank you so much in advance and i apologize if this is such a ridiculous post,\n\nOlivia\n\n",

Or does he think there are only two fonts in the world, Arial and Times New Roman?\n\nIf the latter is the case, then you can safely give him a semibold version of Helvetica or Helvetica Neue (or perhaps even another more attractive sans).\n\nBut you are right, there is no Arial semi-bold that I know of.\n\n"
