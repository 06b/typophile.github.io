  "content": "This image has been making the rounds in Spain recently after the match between Real Madrid and Barcelona last Saturday. It's an alleged tweet by Madrid defender Sergio Ramos, who's famous for making all kinds of less than fortunate remarks on Twitter. If you can read Spanish, you'll get the (unintentional) joke.\n\nThe thing is, although it would be possible for Sergio Ramos to make such a ridiculous statement, the typography looks a little off. It is very similar to Georgia, which is what a lot of Twitter clients are set in, but not quite. The glyphs look slightly thinner and there is less contrast. Plus, the Os look a little rounder than usual.\n\nCan anyone tell me if this indeed Georgia or something else?\n\nMany thanks in advance,\n\nNico Ordozgoiti\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416042914im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Ramos_6593.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Ramos.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416042914/http:/typophile.com/files/Ramos.png) | 184.25 KB |\n\n",
