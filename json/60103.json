  "content": "I would very much appreciate the following paragraph to be translated to enable a clearer insight of Emilé Javal's finding on the relationship between type design (width?) and legibility...\n\nThis is for my MA thesis: Compact Typography:The design of typefaces conceived for small size applications.\n\nYour help is greatly appreciated. I intend to post my specific findings on Javal and Dreyfuss's experiment here on Typophile.\n\nHere is the text...\n\nOn voit que la longueur des lignes diminue en même temps que la hauteur des lettres, mais que la diminution de largeur est bien plus lente que celle en hauteur, parce que les graveurs ont reconnu, sans bien s’en rendre compte, que la diminution de lisibilité est attribuable principalement à la diminution de largeur des lettres. C’est là un fait capital que nous avons signalé depuis longtemps.\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael Hernan\n\n",

(or have I gone too far...)\n\nUpon a first glance, it is seen that line length decreases in direct proportion to the diminishing height of the letters. However under closer scrutiny, the line width decreases at a slower rate than to that of the height. The punch-cutters have recognised that by allowing the letters to become proportionally wider as the text becomes smaller maintains legibility. They understood that a negative impact in legibility is mainly attributable to the decrease in the width of the letters resulting from a 'natural' reduction in scale.\n\nI have included the Fig from the Book however - it doesn't follow the rule observation above very consistently!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nMichael Hernan\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803124136im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Javal-Fig-60_5369.png)\n\n"

I read it as meaning that if point size decreases, so does the length of the line displaying a full alphabet. I would rather translate as follows: \"The line length (in fig 60) is seen to decrease with point size\" (which is a weird way of saying that the line length is an increasing function of the point size). The citation also means that if character height is decreased by some percentage, then the width will be decreased by a smaller percentage. That seems to be true except for the lines at 5 and 4 points. Indeed 4 points 20% less than 5 points but the length at 4 points seems to be about 24% less than that at 5 points.\n\n"

Now, most characters are taller than wide. For a character that is twice taller than wide, if proportions are always kept that way, the rate of increase of the height of that character will always be twice the rate of increase of its width; that is a trivial mathematical fact, having nothing to do with the skills of punchcutters; I thus can't image this is the kind of speed Javal had in mind and that is why I took for granted that he was comparing relative changes instead of absolute changes. If my interpretation is correct, then the line ends are not on the red diagonal (I guess they should be on some convex curve) and the line at 4 points should be much longer.\n\nAfter looking at other threads and links concerning that book, I now feel like having a look at it.

Odd discrepancies such as the narrow set 4pt add added intrigue also reminding us that rules are to be broken when necessary.\n\nWhy I have been fascinated in Javal, is that he is a lay person with a keen interest in optics. My imagination has him in correspondence with M. Tegu (perhaps actual meetings) where the secrets of type manufacture are being explained to him (Javal is blind), then they are being recounted in the book but only as half facts because Javal doesn't quite have the right knowledge to know for instance, if the punch-cutters (engravers) actually knew what they were doing!\n\nBut it is precisely this outside position (mentality) which gave him permission to create with M.

I think Javal expected the available fonts would behave in such a way that when the lines are typeset with them, the right ends would make about the same curve as CM does here (of course, at 4 points, it was also an optical that was to be chosen). I don't know how many fonts were available at the time but it is my feeling the typesetter may have chosen the fonts to get a figure to his liking; he did not understand what Javal had in mind. Don't forget that Javal graduated in 1860 from [Ecole des mines de Paris](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803124136/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_des_mines_de_Paris) before studying medicine. He had an excellent background in mathematics and physics.\n\nNote: the straight blue line corresponds to the imaginary line the reader would have traced from the end of the line at 14 points to 0 points, at the bottom of the figure.\n\n"

However upon reflection I realise that it is a great model to continue the argument because it forms an ideal to which to contrast against.\n\nWithout undermining the sophisticated algorithms used by Computer Modern, it is still (to me) a very single minded and inflexible approach which is insensitive to broader or task specific usage.\n\nThe original (Deberny) Javal (Fig.60) example is a more sophisticated model. (If we can assume that the figure \\*was\\* broadly the intention of the author)... Where we see a single arch in Computer Modern, in Fig 60 three arches can be seen which correspond to broadly accepted typographic usage's; Text, Footnote and Caption.\n\nI have an open agenda in promoting such a 'range' concept or 'size specific' design as I believe high quality typography comes out of such considered usage.\n\nMultiple approaches (non exclusive) have been revealed so far:\n\nA: CM - Design changes algorithymically where interpolation between a big and small size affects the with of a type to become wider the smaller it gets.\n\nB: Size Specific (Type I) - Litterally size specific with out attributed task. Each size has a slightly different design at the discretion of the punch cutter or designer seen with the 18c Caslons (seen also in Miniscule (inspired by Javal/Dreyfuss experimental designs)) without a specific task attributed to the design\n\nC: Size Specific (Type II) What I will call the AdobePro model (is there a more accurate term for this) which assigns a names use to a design.\n\nD: ??\n\nNote: I think it is worth mentioning for clarity for anyone new to this topic that what is not obvious until someone is made aware of the fact (was so in my case) that all the above conditions are in contrast to much of what exists in out digital type Library, which I can state confidently are types for the most part developed to work best at 9-12pt.\n\n"

If I rely on Haralambous 1993, _Parametrization of PostScript fonts through METAFONT — an alternative to Adobe Multiple Master fonts_ ( [pdf, 552K](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803124136/http:/omega.enstb.org/yannis/pdf/epodd-93.pdf)), sizes under 10 points are to be treated differently from those above 10 points. This thread being concerned with small sizes, we may just forget what happens above 10 points. It is also said that, from the 62 parameters used to generate a CM font, two are relevant for this scaling, \"cap-stem\" and \"slab\", shown here.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803124136im_/http:/typophile.com/files/stemandslab_5159.jpg)\n  \nOn page 155 (Section 7, optical scaling) Haralambous goes on to say:<dd>\nTo achieve optical scaling we will apply general rules (again quadratic approximations to known examples) to create distinct fonts for every point size. The task of making the necessary measurements has been done by D. E. Knuth on Monotype Modern 8A (cf. [6, p. vi]). We will take his results and apply them to our case, since optical scaling coefficients have more to do with the properties of human vision than with the style of the font.<br>\n</dd>\n\nJust for the record, those values are (cmr17 size being actually 17.28 points)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803124136im_/http:/typophile.com/files/parameters_3769.jpg)\n\nWhat I find surprising is that those values supposedly obtained after actual measurements have no direct obvious relationship with the line length. On the other hand, if all the lines in the grabs above end on the blue line, then that means that the length L(s) of the line at s points (for s less than 10) satisfies the formula L(s) = ms(s-1)+b where m and b are constants to be found by measurement. I wrote a XeLaTeX program that outputs the exact value of **Length** for each size **s** and then used Excel to find m and b (by linear regression of **Length** vs **s(s-1)**.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803124136im_/http:/typophile.com/files/regression_3426.jpg)\n  \nI get that the length **Length** at size s is 0.5427s(s-1)+71.5982 with an error that is less than 1% in all cases but one, and less than a quarter of a percent in all cases but two.\n\nHow could such a precise relation (quadratic in the size s) hold for Monotype Modern 8A, or even for any CM family whose parameters would have been filled by inspection and measurement?\n\nMichel\n\n"
