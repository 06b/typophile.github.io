In other words the implementation is (relatively) poised and subtle.   \n   \nThe new aiwa logo is at least another level removed in that it has moved into abstraction and is allowed to generate its own logic. Would we be justified in saying the logo becomes louder or more intense? The effect reminds me of Picasso's late drawings where you follow the line of a figure and suddenly a shoulder pops or a muscle flexes as you try to make sense of the whole. I don't want to flog a patch of ground where there was once a dead horse so I won't go on...   \n   \nDo I think the designer's intention matters here? Yes because it 's easy to rush to judgements based on our preconceptions but it isn't at all desirable. A useful critique will always attempt to meet the object on open (or deterritorialized) ground.   \n   \nDo I love the new aiwa logo? No, but I think it's a lot more interesting than most people here are prepared to admit. If this forum is meant to present a new logo every now and again so that everyone can take the piss then fair enough. Let me know and I won't bother anyone with further posts.\n\n"
