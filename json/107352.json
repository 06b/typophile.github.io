      "content": "You are correct, Johan, the point of interest is the reverse contrast, an idea that dates at least as far back as 1821 with Caslon's Italian [http://typophile.com/node/103389](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416083058/http:/typophile.com/node/103389 \"http://typophile.com/node/103389\")  \nI had hoped that someone would find a digital match to the book cover but I see that I am not the only one who tried and failed to find a match.  \nSo we can speculate as to several possibilites:  \n1. This is one of Herb Lubalin's alphabets, perhaps only released in poster form.  \n2. This was designed by an ECAL student or teacher -- as Takashi suggests. Could be artwork rather than a font as such.  \nTo replicate it, perhaps the easiest option is to tinker with Transat to modify some of the letterforms, then do some vertical bolding and other adjustments. Results of a quick test, that could be further modified for a closer match:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416083058im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ReverseEmphasis1_3601.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"

The text identifies the former MAAD students who designed the various fonts in the “Types We Can Make,” i.e. Andrea Anner, Luke Archer, Florine Bonaventure, Jane Cheng, Yann Pablo Corminboeuf, Philippe Karrer, Haakon Spencer and Matthew Fenton. If you want to purchase the font, or the rights to it, some detective work would be required to find the designer. In the interim here is an enhanced image of the character set:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416083058im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ScotlandItalian_6029.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"
