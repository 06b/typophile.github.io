      "content": "HUNGER THIRST: most probably custom and possibly hand-drawn from scratch as [Derek Hollister](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/dribbble.com/shots/608462-Hunger-N-Thirst-Identity), one of the designers in charge of this identity at [The Infantree](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.theinfantree.com/work/hunger-n-thirst) has a type work on his dribbble called ' [Absolute Finest Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/dribbble.com/shots/986127-Absolute-Finest-Type) which looks pretty close to the one for 'HUNGER N THIRST'. For what it's worth, if I have to recreate it, I'd probably start with some font like [Diamante EF](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/diamante) adding those latin (triangle) serifs.  \nMore 'Diamante': [Five Star Final](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/five-star-final), [Herald Gothic FB](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/herald-gothic), [Chamfer Gothic RR](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/chamfer-gothic-rr), [Uncle Sam Slim NF](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/uncle-sam-slim-nf), [Pillar](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/loshaj-foundry/pillar), [Dayta](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/elibrumbaugh.com/Dayta-Typeface)  \n\"Out-of-the-box\" alternatives but still some customization needed: [Supremaganda BTN](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/supremaganda-btn), [Bourbon](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/bourbon), [Sheepman](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/sheepman), [Yeoman Gothic RR](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/yeoman-gothic-rr)  \nStarting with a slab and (mainly) reworking serifs to latin ones: [Player](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/player)\n\n"

While I don't see the exact matching alternates in the glyph set (I didn't examine it too closely) the general style including some specific points do match. It may be the one, with some additional customisation for the logo.\n\n"

Your best chance is probably to directly ask [Yossi Belkin](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.behance.net/gallery/The-Logo-Volume-II/13601081) (and if he answer, drop the answer here :). To me, it feels \"custom from a commercial typeface\" (meaning \"not drawn from scratch\"). Reminds me of [Caslon Italic /K](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caslon/semibold-italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/511579/346) (and / [R](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829175301/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caslon/semibold-italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/511579/353) for the top swash).
