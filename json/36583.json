  "content": "I just downloaded a font – FreightSans – and noticed to my horror that the following Danish characters – æøå, ÆØÅ – aren’t where they’re supposed to be. I can see in the character setting, that they are there, but when I press the ÆØÅ characters on my keyboard I get something like Ê\\_ Â.\n\nWhen I look in the detailed view in FontExplorer and press on one of the mentioned characters I can see that they not assigned to any keystroke, but only have glyph ID’s, so that’s a little weird.\n\nHowever, the mentioned characters come out fine when I set a sample on the Joshua Darden website, so what’s going wrong? I have the truetype version on a mac. Other truetype fonts work fine, so I don’t thing it’s related to the format.\n\nDoes anyone know what I can do? I’ve also written to Joshua Dardens site, but I’m guessing you guys in here are faster.\n\n [‹ Japanese font](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202204141/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36461 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font newbie looking for advice on special sorts for custom application ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202204141/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36611 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Are all the other fonts behaving all right?\n\nDid you buy the font from the man himself or from a dealer? I had a little problem with one of the glyphs after purchasing from an online font shop. Mr Darden replaced the files promptly, the dealer had had an old buggy version of the font.\n\n"

I ask not to give anybody a hard time, but because it could be educational, whether it’s a font glitch or user error.\n\n(If I were to hazard a guess, he’s on a Mac, the font is OpenType CFF, and it’s another case of the bizarre Apple-encoding-glyphs-by-name-instead-of-cmap-table issue. It’s bitten us at Adobe, too.)\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"
