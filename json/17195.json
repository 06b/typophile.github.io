  "content": "Hello everyone\n\nI am new to Typophile and this is my first post. I am glad to be here. I have an OpenType features related problem. I want to make the following substitutions:\n\n1 + 0 with a glyph called 1\\_0  \n1 + 0 + 0 with a glyph called 1\\_0\\_0 and  \n1 + 0 + 0 + 0 with a glyph called 1\\_0\\_0\\_0\n\n(1 and 0 can be replaced by any digit - see code below)\n\nI work in Fontlab Studio 5 and I at first I wrote the following code:\n\n# glyph classes  \n@digitsnozero=[one two three four five six seven eight nine];  \n@digits=[zero one two three four five six seven eight nine];  \n@twodigits=[X X\\_X X\\_X\\_X X\\_L L L\\_X L\\_X\\_X L\\_X\\_X\\_X X\\_C];  \n@threedigits=[C C\\_C C\\_C\\_C C\\_C\\_C\\_C D D\\_C D\\_C\\_C D\\_C\\_C\\_C D\\_C\\_C\\_C\\_C];  \n@fourdigits=[M M\\_M M\\_M\\_M M\\_M\\_M\\_M];\n\nfeature liga {  \n# substitutions for two digits  \nsub @digitsnozero’ @digits by @twodigits;  \n# substitutions for three digits  \nsub @digitsnozero’ [@digits @twodigits @threedigits] @digits by @threedigits;  \n# substitutions for four digits  \nsub [one two three four]’ [@digits @twodigits @threedigits]  \n@digits @digits by @fourdigits;  \n} liga;\n\nThe problem is that when the first rule is activated the other two are ignored. As a result I only get the first substitution (1 + 0 -\\> 1\\_0)\n\nI solved the problem by putting each rule in a different feature (the first in onum, the second in smcp and the third in liga - it works).\n\nSo now I have the following:\n\nfeature onum {  \n# substitutions for two digits  \nsub @digitsnozero’ @digits by @twodigits;  \n} onum;\n\nfeature smcp {  \n# substitutions for three digits  \nsub @digitsnozero’ [@digits @twodigits @threedigits] @digits by @threedigits;  \n} smcp;\n\nfeature liga {  \n# substitutions for four digits  \nsub [one two three four]’ [@digits @twodigits @threedigits] @digits @digits by @fourdigits;  \n} liga;\n\nI read in the OpenType specification about the Chaining Context Substitution but I did not understand how am I supposed to do it.\n\nCan anyone tell me if I can put all the three rules in one feature (e.g. in a liga feature)? Can I do anything with ‘lookup’?\n\nGeorge Triantafyllakos - backpacker.gr\n\n",
