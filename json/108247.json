Below is a sample for your reference.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317073747im_/http:/typophile.com/files/adobe-2_4820.gif)\n\nSide discussion: Did anything ever happen with Eric Gill's Hebrew typeface? Has it been digitized? I read on a blog it has been but was unable to find a version of it.\n\n",

He did not understand Hebrew.)\n\n"
