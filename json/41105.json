  "content": "Agamemnon began as an experiment I did on Fontographer years ago. I revived it over a year ago and began discussing it here on Typophile. [That original thread is here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/typophile.com/node/28862), but has become long and unwieldy, potentially frightening off new critics trying to wade through the history of revisions. I've since moved development of this font to FontForge. The ability to edit with Spiro curve technology has been invaluable!\n\nThe font could be categorized as transitional and slab serif. The serifs and horizontal strokes are cupped and curved, creating a visual texture that should maintain legibility at small sizes and great distances. The current weight, though, is a tad awkward; too heavy for a book weight, but not quite a bold.\n\nOver time I have expanded the character set. Once started with a basic MacRoman, I have since expanded it to include most of the Unicode Latin codepages, as well as basic Cyrillic, Greek, and Cherokee, plus Latin small caps, tabular oldstyle figures, fractions, stylistic alternates, special Icelandic ligatures, and a whole lot of currency and miscellaneous symbols.\n\nAnd the snark, uppercase eszet, ruble sign, _& al._\n\nThe PDF files attached here are all development version numbered, beginning with version twenty-nine. Earlier revisions are documented in the original thread linked above. The most recent one will have the highest number. Files with the same number are different settings of the same version.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pr-AgamemnonTwentyNine-ffd.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-AgamemnonTwentyNine-ffd.pdf) | 324.53 KB |\n| [pr-AgamemnonTwentyNine-text.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-AgamemnonTwentyNine-text.pdf) | 400.04 KB |\n| [Agamamnon30-b1-i1\\_text\\_sampler.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/typophile.com/files/Agamamnon30-b1-i1_text_sampler.pdf) | 55.4 KB |\n| [pr-AgamemnonThirtyFive.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-AgamemnonThirtyFive.pdf) | 473.76 KB |\n| [agamemnon36-12ptsample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/typophile.com/files/agamemnon36-12ptsample.pdf) | 120.25 KB |\n| [Agamemnonß36 Cherokee de comparison.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/typophile.com/files/Agamemnon%C3%9F36%20Cherokee%20de%20comparison.pdf) | 31.85 KB |\n\n",

Each line is lowercase U with umlaut, lowercase I, period, precomposed lowercase L with interpunct, a second lowercase L, and then a middle dot (used normally for inputting it). I'm generally of the line of thinking that the two Ls should be kerned normally just with a dot in between them.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256im_/http:/typophile.com/files/umlaut_i_period_catalan_double_l_interpunct_6001.png)\n\nHere's an excerpt from a [detailed paper](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb16-3/tb48vali.pdf) on the subject of Catalonian typographic conventions:\n\n<cite>The present proposal consists of deﬁning the character as a digraph formed by two letters, with a middle dot as diacritic mark. The middle dot has to be located between the two letters and equidistant from their stems. In order to facilitate reading, the middle dot has to be centered at half the height of uppercase letters. This is due to the fact that the digraph only appears between vowels. Moreover, between the two letters there has to be the same distance as there is between the two letters when they are not written with a middle dot, in order not to break continuity of words containing the digraph. There seems to be no deﬁnitive need for the middle dot to be smaller than a period, contrary to the proposal in Mestres (1990). Boldface fonts are the only ones out of 27 standard TEX fonts where a smaller middle dot would be, to the author’s taste, aesthetically more pleasant. As a matter of fact, most (if not all) old and modern printed representations of the digraph share the fact that the middle dot and the period have the same size. <cite></cite></cite>\n\nHowever, he's discussing exclusively TEX fonts, and admitingly not in the design field at all. [This other fella](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/femfum.com/PDF/ElaGeminada/LletraDeConvitPerLaElaGeminada.pdf) presents far more background and I believe based on my rudimentary knowledge of Catalonian actually works as a designer. I'll try to trudge through it more.\n\nIt may be of note that [this paper](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256/http:/wwwa.urv.net/centres/Departaments/fcatalana/TipografiaDeQualitat.pdf)&nbsp;which discusses the ideas of \"quality typography\" (and is a bit easier to read than the second article I mentioned) has a l·l with a dot significantly smaller than the period. While he is a not a designer by trade, his article is quite well written and could easily be confused with a designer (of course, I might just be seeing a different guy with the same name on google, but who knows).\n\nAlso, while I like your bold and italic capital Q, the normal one seems just a little too.... Thai-like for me.  \n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos». (La Luz Oscura, por Javier Guerrero)_\n\n"

As I mentioned in the other thread, knowing what reader's perceptions are likely to be is a guessing game until you can find someone familiar with reading and writing Cherokee that can provide the sort of feedback that will be helpful. In the development stage, its best to analyse what few examples are available, keeping in mind that there are very few that would constitute strong typographic tradition, so cues also should be taken from the hand drawn models as well. Keep in mind that using this methodology does not guarantee that users will like what you do, but it is at least a starting point—it may not let you know what \"the symbols are supposed to be\", as we don't have much of an evolution of glyph form to draw from, so many of the finer details are up to the type designer. Some of the more core variations can be seen by looking at the various fonts, as there were some changes from the first (1827) to the second (1835) font and then various other mutilations occurred generally in the 20th century interpretations, most of which are not terribly instructive as to how things should look typographically, although they do inform expectations, as these are what people are used to in varying degrees. I think that handwritten examples may be more informative then many of the modern fonts.\n\nA historical timeline such as the following is useful:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256im_/http:/typophile.com/files/E_chart_4746.jpg)\n\nI think there is something to be said for at least thinking about how to separate some forms from their (apparent) Latin counterparts. The environment in which Cherokee is learned now is almost certainly different then it was 150+ years ago, and I imagine most all learners will already be literate in English and so will be biased as to glyph shape—probably less of a hurdle to overcome for young students then for older ones.  \nIn the most basic approach, analyse \"shared\" forms: does the \"_i_\" need to look like the uppercase \"T\"? and what can be done to modify it away from that form while maintaining its legibility? Of course, the first metal types used an existing \"T\" (smallcap Didot) rather then contriving something new. Looking to Sequoyah's first for-print model, he drew several wedge-terminals as having open counters, which is a clue to one or two alternate approaches, as terminal treatments in Sequoyah's model actually have some semantic meaning, rather then just being stylistic goo-gahs.\n\nFYI, the Plantagenet sample above is version 1 from several years ago—many of its deficiencies have been or are being addressed for version 2.\n\n"

This feature is also seen on some of the Cherokee symbols shown earlier. I also unified the serifs on the lowercase and narrowed some of the letters that were analogous in the Latin set. Still, I think the lowercase may be too short, so I could make them taller on the next run through.\n\nAlso included are my currency symbols. Try and name them all!\n\n"

Theta/kappa/pi/omega/rho have alternate versions either used as symbols or just differently prefered forms, the theta is open and looksl like cursive, the kappa looks more like an x sort of thing, the omega is closed, rho has an extra stroke, beta has no descender, etc.\n\nAnd let's see, I can almost get 'em all without cheating, dollar cent pound generic yen florin shilling common-european, um, crona franc lira ...... pesetas reais won dinar euro penny .... ruble....\n\nThe cyrillic looks good. I agree with the choice of darker descenders. I wonder if maybe on л you might want to pull the left leg in a little bit. Also, the accent on И seems a bit too far to the left. Or actually that might just be the ` as it's pretty far on the left on the E too.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

I'm just not always satisfied with the results of the auto-assembly. Stacked accents are especially a bother, as they distort the line height (at least until I correct the parameters). I tightened the line spacing to .7 to get them even this close together.\n\n"

I'm a touch too broke to upgrade my software, so the only thing I have to display the whole font without crashing on Character Pallette input is Text Edit.\n\nAs for its purpose, it's a bit too massive for an everyday text font, though it has features that should make it highly readable. It's a bit clunky with those wavy slabs.\n\nThere are not a lot of Cherokee fonts out there, as far as I can tell. Many of them are really poorly designed, like that \"official\" one I showed above, but are still considered usable by those who use them. In my opinion Plantagenet is the most thoughtful and best looking example of a Cherokee font I've ever seen, but even Ross Mills concedes that it is deficient in its current form. I have done scarcely any research on the matter, in comparison, and I consider it high praise that anyone with even casual expertise commends my efforts.\n\n"

So what you are doing is okay by me. Though I'm no spokesperson for either tribe. However, I am a sixth generation descendent of the original Sequoyah and I believe he would like what you are trying to do. Keep it up and let me know when you are ready to show it off a bit.

But after I really pondered over your latest chart there are a couple of things that I should mention. Nothing great - just a few observations.\n\n1 - the first symbol should be down at the last of your chart. (unless you did this for a purpose) It's part of the vowels.\n\n2 - the \"doh\" symbol threw me for a second. It's downside up. I'm cool with that but that leads me to the third thing.\n\n3 - The Keetoowah and some elder Cherokees are very traditional and though I see nothing wrong with creating a font such as yours, some of the people will not go for it because it's so different (which is what I like about it). They are very weary of change. It usually takes a while for new things to catch on with them. However, at the same time, if they see the young people taking to it - the elders will let it slide because the younger generation is accepting it. One of the things that's going for your font is the fact that it looks gothic (sorry but I just had to say it - but hey! gothic Cherokee, cool). And our young people will like that.\n\nAgain, I like what you're doing. I'd like to see it finished.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you, this is exactly the sort of advice I need. As a teacher of the language, you necessarily have a deeper technical understanding that even native speakers and writers may lack, so I certainly consider you to be an expert. I'll give more weight to your opinions than many other peoples research. On to your points:\n\n1. Indeed you are correct, and in checking my materials I understand why I did it like that and why you are right.  \nFor some reason the V (shaped like \"i\") appears first in Plantagenet Cherokee when entered from the character palette. In Agamemnon, it appears sixth on the character palette, which is still incorrect, but that is where it is in the Unicode sequence. At least it appears after A (D), E (R with hook), I (T), O (Ꭳ), and U (O with horn), which are all the open vowels without consonants, so they belong on the same row together. For some reason Unicode has them at the beginning, rather than the end, which you suggest is correct. A logical argument could be made to put them either at the beginning or the end, but I'll go with your advice on the customary position when I produce my next sample.\n\n2. DO is \"V\" shaped in the official font, and I will adjust mine to reflect that in adherence with custom. I gave it the \"Λ\" shape because it appears that way both in the Plantagenet font and in this scan of an early sketch of the syllabary attributed to Sequoyah:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090256im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Syllabary_6129.JPG)\n  \nBut doesn't the V shape of DO sometimes lead to confusion with TSE?  \nI also noticed that the \"A\" shaped GO has a vertical stroke on the crossbar in this sample, not seen on other examples, but that is why I included it on mine.  \nI also expect my design of YI might be controversial.  \nDE has confused me, since it is one of several \"S\" shaped symbols, which looks just mangled in the official font and is distinguished from DU only by a twisted serif and half a line across the middle. In my DE I tried to make that cross stroke suggest a reversal, as if a \"c\" were drawn above a reversed \"c\" in a single motion, rather than as an \"S\". Does this sound reasonable to you?\n\n3. I'm not sure what to say about this. In the scripts of most languages, there is a lot of room for stylistic variation and decoration, but it's generally an issue of aesthetic preference unless you go so far with the design as to get something actually \"wrong\". With the CWY it's hard to tell what right and wrong even is, so I appreciate the assistance you've given me and any more you give in the future. The only connection I have with the language is that my parents went to Sequoia High School in Redwood City, CA, and the place was most likely named after the tree.\n\nI'm always cautious using the term \"Gothic\" around here. It has at least two nearly opposite meanings in typography which have little to do with the architecture, fashion/lifestyle trends, or Germanic tribes sharing that name.\n\n"

Anyway, my point is this: the font you've developed has a progressive look that is not only a feast for the eye but it will help promote the learning of the language in general. If a writing system is to exist in fifty, a hundred years - it will have to evolve just as the spoken language has to change.\n\nI would say keep the DO just as you have it. Although it threw me for a couple of seconds, it is (as you pointed out) how it is in the earlier chart.\n\nIn an earlier post, I mentioned that I've read many, many examples of the hand written language. And during these readings, you would be amazed at how creative the elders were with some of the symbols by putting their own little creative twists to them. I remember watching my father practice his hand writing and when he was finished - the end results were almost calligraphic. Folks would comment about how pretty his writing was.\n\nAgain, my point is this: Finish your font. It's different and fresh. I, for one (and again, I'm no spokesperson for either tribe), am not so closed minded or afraid of change that I would want to stick with the same old tired \"Offical\" font. I would use your font, if nothing else than just to be different. It's useable and readable.\n\n"
