In today's OpenType world you have choices!  \nIt seems to me that default figures should be the ones most people should use most of the time. Let's assume you have included in your soon-to-be-released Opentype face, Oldstyle, Proportional Lining, and Tabular lining figures. What would be your druthers for default and , most importantly, WHY?  \nLet's see a vote here, OK?\n\nSorry I can't do the cool form that tallies everything on the fly. Maybe if I were some cool COWBOY or Bezier Wrangler, I could do it but I am not so I just have to hope unnamed guys like that will take pity and set one of those puppies up here on Typophile instead of my lame straw poll :-) Hint?\n\nChrisL\n\n",

A font is a tool for people to use, as many people as possible. Customers\\* are used to standards. And although I think that OsF would make the best standard, it isn't the standard customers have been living with for 20 years.\n\nAll other type of numbers are features. These days, features are easy enough to come by, at least for designers. Even Quark's getting on board now, since they've just released their public beta of XPress 7.0.\n\n\\*This may be controversial, and I don't have any evidence to back it up, but I think that graphic designers are not the majority of font buyers. They certainly aren't the majority of font users! Fonts are for everyone, designers and non-designers alike. We can agree on that, can't we?\n\n"

Later we revised this for a couple of the families, because Office wanted to give them a prominent place, meaning that they would be more likely to be used in business documents and places where people would expect tabular figures.\n\nFor a while, I was arguing in favour of tabular oldstyle figures as the default in all the fonts, but the MS ART people decided that we should go whole hog and make them proportional.\n\nDan, I hear what you are saying about user expectations and de facto standards based on longstanding convention. But when Microsoft are ships fonts with an operating system, that tends to have a pretty big impact on users' expectations.\n\n"

My next release will have Proportional Scotch-style - see \"Georgia\" - numerals, which are between x- and cap-height, and have half-descenders and full-ascenders. Again, these numerals look right in context. (The typeface in question does contain Proportional and Tabular Oldstyle, Lining, and x-height numerals too, along with numerators, denominators, and scientific inferiors. 10 number sets in total, but I really only had to design half of them, and can re-use the other half.)\n\nI think that historical precedent can dictate the default as well: Garaldes should have Proportional Oldstyle, and modernist sanses should have Tabular Lining. These just look right, half of which is probably due to their looking \"unsurprising\".\n\n"

They are less likely to be typographically astute enough to change proportional to lining when required, and may well be using software that doesn't even give them the option.\n\n"
