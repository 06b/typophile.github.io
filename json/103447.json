But I believe the little hardly-ever hooks(?) on the top left of lowercase letters like 'p', 'r', 'm', and 'n' are terminals, of the serif subclass, within the horizontal serif under subclass, nested in the left-sided horizontal serif super-under subclass, tucked firmly into the x-height left-sided horizontal serif micro-class, though others may have names with more precision.\n\n"
