Please check out the following page:\n\n[http://www.gamesandprint.co.uk/cardeng.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20100711061753/http:/www.gamesandprint.co.uk/cardeng.htm \"http://www.gamesandprint.co.uk/cardeng.htm\")\n\nThe font used on the corner of these cards (i.e. 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A) - can anyone help me ID it? It seems pretty standard across most of the english/UK decks I've played with.\n\nThanks!  \nMartin\n\n",
