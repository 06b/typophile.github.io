It reminds me of [Bello Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150220004658/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/bello/script/), also by Underware, but it's not that.\n\nIt has a script 'feel', but I wonder if it could be the italic of some casual display face. I sure don't recognize it, which naturally makes me want to say 'custom font', but I know that's an easy way out.\n\nScripts are so 'in' right now, that it could be something new I just haven't seen yet. I think heavy connecting scripts are always in demand, judging from the steady stream of 'Eclat' ID requests that are always trickling in. If I was a font designer that's what I'd be working on.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
