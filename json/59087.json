I had taken a look at Linotypes Gneisenauette, but found the contrast too low for the sample you provided. But it was the contrast I liked in the image you posted, so I decided to go ahead and create something myself (combining it with the sources mentioned above). Hopefully creating something unique enough to differentiate from Gneisenauette.\n\n"

      "content": "Very fascinating script. There's a very appealing irregural rhythm to it.\n\nI think there could be a bit too much stress on the upright strokes, though. There's not much distinction between 'a' and 'u', for example. The loop of the 'e' and the curve of the 'c' are also a bit difficult to see.\n\nWhy are the 'h' and 'n' different in structure? I would prefer a similar arc in the latter as in the former.\n\nI realize a part of the visual appeal of the script is in its stroke-contrast, but it could be a bit more readable if the hairlines were a touch thicker. (I don't mean as thick as in Gneisenauette, though.)\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry, I hadn't noticed someone replied here.\n\nThank you for the comments.  \nI agree that the hairlines should become a bit thicker, which might also help the 'c' and 'a' become more easily recognizable as such.\n\nThe difference between the 'h' and 'n' is due to the 'm'. The 'm' doesn't work with the inward bend on the last stroke, so I tried and outward bend there. Then the 'n' had to be a close match to the 'm', so got the same outward bend. That whole outward ebnd might not be working very well, because it is only used in 'n' and 'm' as outward, while on other characters 'a', 'u', etc. it is used as inward. Which might confuse the reader.\n\nI find it hard to proceed with this script, though. Especially because of the right-tilted brush-stroke. If anyone knows of any examples of scripts with a right-tilted brush-stroke, please let me know.\n\n"
