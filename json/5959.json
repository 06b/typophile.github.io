I own the book in question and I've always admired the face. Thanks for the speedy detective work.   \n   \nI've seen J. Abbot Miller use this face before but couldn't figure it out. Of the New York hot shots, his type tastes are a little more evolved than most. He did after all design the premiere issue of the ill fated ONE using all Eureka. He's scores a few points for that.\n\n"
