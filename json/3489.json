The challenge was to develope a Yummy bold caps font for titling, who can work well for Japanese language readers.   \n   \nIf anyone can read or recognize if this first designs sketches works, maybe someone who know about Katakana or Hiragana, can make some critiques here..every help is welcome!   \n   \nMuchas gracias,   \n   \nmh   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121532im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28090.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi, Miguel.   \n   \nI'm Japanese. It is a very pretty nice font. Is the resource of this font the sketch of the handwriting style?   \nThe font of the handwriting style is in fashion in Japan.   \n   \nWell, There are some wrong points.   \n   \n\"SU\", \"SE\", \"SO\". The right-hand side upper part point (Its name is \"DAKU-TEN\") is unnecessary.   \nNot \"ZU\", \"ZE\", \"ZO\".   \n   \n\"HO\", The top of right-hand side does not cross. It is not \"MA.\"   \n   \nAnd as my opinion,   \n   \nI cannot distinguish \"SO\" from \"N\".   \nNote that angle of stroke. Right-hand stroke of \"SO\" moves top to bottom, the other, stroke of \"N\" moves bottom to top.   \nAlthough, Japanese people sometimes mistake.   \n   \nDistinction of \"SHI\" and \"TSU\" is good!   \nJapanese people sometimes mistake too.   \n   \n\"NU\" and \"ME\" are too wide.   \n   \n\"GA\", Upper double point \"DAKU-TEN\" should be most in right-hand side.   \n   \nfrom KYA,KYU,KYO to HYA,HYU,HYO   \nRight-hand side character is too large.   \n   \n   \nI am looking forward to completion of this font.\n\n"

      "content": "It's nice, Miguel, but there's too much 'stylistic' divergence between the Latin font and the Japanese fonts. The Latin font is squarish, geometric, clean, 'cool'. The Japanese fonts, as Kunihiko said, look handwritten, maybe a bit 'childish' too.   \n   \nI'd try to make the Japanese fonts more squarish and geometric like the Latin, but that's a personal preference. They're still nice fonts in itself.   \n   \n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*   \n   \nI mostly agree with Okano's post, of course.   \nAnd I'd like to add that:   \n- 'N' (h) is too short, make it taller;   \n- 'KA' (k) is not just the 'KA' (h) without the little stroke, the hiragana should be rounder/softer ;   \n- the descending strokes of 'KO', 'RO' and 'YO' (k) are too long;   \n- 'A', 'WA' (h), and 'TA' (k) are too big;   \n- 'YA' (both h and k) is too small;   \n- 'RU' and 'RO' (k) are too exaggerated.   \n(h=hiragana, k=katakana)\n\n"

I think this template is complete, yes.   \n   \n   \n\\> 2) Is Kanji really not needed?   \n   \nWhat do you mean?   \nI guess this face is intended for some sort of 'small-size-display' (like interface buttons or something), and in this case you can choose to work only with Kana. I'd say that when you have single words or pairs of words, you can use only Kana. But when you have a whole paragraph or sentence, you should use Kanji too.   \nBoth Kana alphabets are phonetic, so you can write anything (that you'd write with Kanji) with them.\n\n"

Although Japanese text with Kanji does have an incredible amount of color variation, I suspect the Kana sets need to be more uniform? If so, I'd try to compensate by making the strokes of the more complex letters thinner.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

There are words, for example, that have proper Kanji spellings, but that most people spell/write using only Hiragana ('arigatou' is a common example, and Katakana is mostly used for foreign words).   \n   \nI think so too.   \nIn the case of a packaging design, Sometime, a brand name and company name may be displayed in kana. A font of only kana is popular.   \n   \nThere are some fonts of only kana.   \nfor example...   \nGrayGraphics(FreeFont 1byte)   \n [http://www.orange.ne.jp/~den7/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121532/http:/www.orange.ne.jp/~den7/index.html)   \n   \nAlmost all the fonts in this site consist of only kana.   \nIt is used as a display font. I use often.   \n   \nWhile, There is also a kana font which replaces full set Japanesefont's kana.   \nFor example, Adobe's Ryo is.   \n   \nAdobe Ryo (PDF)   \n [http://www.adobe.co.jp/products/fontfolio/pdfs/ryo.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121532/http:/www.adobe.co.jp/products/fontfolio/pdfs/ryo.pdf)   \nThis textsetting replaced Kozuka Mincho's kana with Ryo.   \n   \n\\>One more thing.. any kerning text or   \n\\>Pangram to start to write in japanese?   \n   \nKana may adjoin all characters. So, a huge quantity of a kerning pair is needed. It is infinitely.   \nIt is better to have been able to set without depending on kerning as much as possible. Therefore, in this case, it is better to equalize character width of this font.\n\n"
