  "content": "I'm new to the whole sell your font thing. I was wondering if I could get some help wrapping my head around the different approaches. Can you sell fonts on your own website with a EULA and be just fine? Does myfonts.com take too much of your money? Do foundries buy fonts from independant designers? What are some ways of selling your fonts and if anyone has some good firsthand expirience that'd be great. thanks\n\n",
