My Address Book gets corrupted; I don't know if there are conflicts between Font Reserve and Font Book; and certain fonts turn themselves off and on without my wanting it. I installed Adobe CS soon after Panther, and don't know it Adobe has some fonts load automatically.   \n   \nOver the years, I've used Font Reserve, Suitcase, and ATM Deluxe and am sad that ATM Deluxe no longer exists, as it was my fave. With nearly 10,000 fonts, this is all a big headache. Should I disable FontBook? Any insights, tips?\n\n"

A previously working font can go bad due to a temporary addition of a client font with the same name. It does not have to be turned on. I have seen this on multiple machines. Below Bold faces fine, Light have lost their map. Replacing the outline may or may not resolve the issue depending on OS X's mood at the time ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526122237im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \n ![OS X Font problem illustrated](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526122237im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/40792.jpg)   \n   \nFace appears to lose font map due to conflict.
