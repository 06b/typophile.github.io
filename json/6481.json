      "content": "Very interesting, yet factually skewed. I could spend the time to address each of the many points that are woefully misleading, but as an unpaid officer of SOTA, I have to get to work at my paying job, as I do not have endless leisure time that many academics seem to have to wax endlessly on topics they are only partly informed on. I did hear some rumblings after TC2002 about Freddy Nader being squeezed out of the planning committee (Which is funny because his name never came up during the planning as a potential planner or potential speaker).   \n   \nI will let others clarify the rest of Lucs well-intentioned but all too uninformed commentary.\n\n"
