      "content": "Chinese typefaces' classification is obviously very different from that of latin/western scripts. That said, you could look for a \"gothic\" style ( [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East\\_Asian\\_sans-serif\\_typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131185546/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_sans-serif_typeface \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East\\_Asian\\_sans-serif\\_typeface\")).  \nPlease note also the difference between traditional and simplified Chinese.\n\n"

      "content": "In the context of Chinese, the typeface style that you're looking for is called _Heiti_ (黑体 _hēitǐ_) or simply _Hei_.\n\nIn Japanese, it is called _Gothic_ (ゴシック体 _goshikkutai_), and in Korean, it is called _Dotum_ (돋움 _dotum_), though before the mid-1990s it was called _Gothic_ (고딕체/고딕體 _godikche_) like Japanese.\n\nIn terms of font suggestions, consider Adobe Heiti Std Regular, which is bundled with a wide range of Adobe applications, including Adobe Reader. Contact me offline for details.\n\n"
