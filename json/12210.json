The font is named for [John Baskerville](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/John%20Baskerville)'s lover, is a mildly stylized [Baskerville](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Baskerville) [revival](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/revival) known for its profusion of colorful [ligature](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ligature)s and \"petite caps\", a unique variation on the theme of [small caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/small%20capitals). Mrs Eaves is a technical tour de force, formerly being accompanied by a program from [LettError](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/LettError) intended to help designers manage its unwieldy set of ligatures, and was recently converted by [John Butler](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/John%20Butler) into an overwhelmingly full-featured [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) family. Mrs Eaves is beloved by graphic designers but some typographers and type designers question its fitness for use in body text, primarily because of concerns about how the design is spaced.  \nTo gain a better understanding of the solutions and problems that are associated with Mrs Eaves, one should read [Licko's rationale](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=109) for designing the font. There are also several threads on Typophile that discuss the [virtues and shortcomings](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/node/687) of Mrs Eaves, [what to pair](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/node/14884) with this typeface, and [suitable alternatives](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/node/13084).\n\nMrs Eaves is available through [Emigre](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Emigre) at [http://www.emigre.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028214139/http:/www.emigre.com/ \"http://www.emigre.com\").\n\n",
