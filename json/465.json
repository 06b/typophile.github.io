Otherwise, since Uc letters have more white space around them, they (Uc) would look lighter than lc.   \nBut it should be just a slight extra weight. No more than 110%, I think. Of course, this percentage depends on the typeface too, some typeface may need more Uc extra weight.   \nA priori, there's no negative consequences. It's just a necessary optical adjustment.\n\n"

But 20th   \ncentury technique did not have the same effect and so   \nthe extra weight in the capitals was more pronounced   \nin his contemporary proofs. The result is that he slimmed   \ndown the weight in the capitals in order to get an   \nequivalent harmony in Linotype Monticello.   \n   \nI seem to remember Matthew saying that when he did   \nhis recent digital revival of Monticello, he chose to slim   \nthe weight of the capitals even further, relative to the   \nlowercase, because the capitals of 19th-century style   \ntypes (even as adjusted by Griffith in the 50s) still   \ntended to look too heavy to the modern eye.   \n   \nI say, Trust your eyes.
