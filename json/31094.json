  "content": "It's been over 10 years now that I have been making and selling my fonts. In celebration of this anniversary, I have created a catalog of my complete retail font library.\n\nThis is no normal type specimen book, though. I wrote a completely original pangram for nearly every font in the catalog. This makes for some interesting reading, so please enjoy!\n\nI would like to give thanks to Mark Simonson for creating the [Pangrammer Helper](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225721/http:/ms-studio.com/Animation/pangrammerhelper.html) that I used to make my pangrams.\n\n[Download the MADType 2007 Anniversary Catalog Here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225721/http:/www.madtype.net/pdf/2007_MADType_Catalog.pdf). (PDF, 744 KB)\n\nOr for more information, please visit [http://www.madtype.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014225721/http:/www.madtype.net/ \"http://www.madtype.net\")\n\n",
