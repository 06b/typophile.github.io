Specifically, what do you think of the success of fonts in the vein of Thirsty Rough or Voyage?\n\nAs a purely digital designer, I'm glad to have elements like these to design with; but as fellow typophiles/designers, do you think these trends have a decent shelf life for branding, or do you feel like it's a more fleeting trend?\n\n",

      "content": "I’ve seen a clear increase in the use of old calligraphic and semi-calligraphic flare-serif typefaces, especially the late 30’s face [Lydian](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420103145/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_(typeface)), but also the likes of [Monotype Albertus](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420103145/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_(typeface)), [ITC Tiepolo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420103145/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiepolo/) and 2013’s [Dragon](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420103145/http:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/dragon). I’ve noticed these faces are often contrasted by popular contemporary geometric sans-serifs (amongst these, Lineto’s Circular seems to have become particularly popular). Just this week I’ve seen flare-faces used in [Angel Olsen’s new album cover](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420103145/http:/nbhap.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Angel-Olsen-cover-2014.jpg) (Lydian) and a set of good concert posters by [Kees Bakker](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420103145/http:/www.typographicposters.com/kees-bakker/) (Tiepolo).\n\n"

      "content": "Nice summary, Jørgen.\n\nGrant, keep in mind that (like most trends) the organic/handwritten thing is just one of many and your experience will vary depending on region, design format, and field. Also, I feel like the popularity of analog/handmade things in general jumped maybe 4–5 years ago and has plateaued at a high level since then.\n\n"

      "content": "> do you think these trends have a decent shelf life for branding, or do you feel like it's a more fleeting trend?\n\nI think anything with a lot of personality is prone to be associated with its time, so the handwriting styles (in particular the ones you mention) are not likely to be considered “timeless” 20 years from now. But there are always retro revivals of what was once novel and new (the chromatic wood type stuff, for example). The best typefaces from any of these trends will certainly be a valid choice at any time if chosen wisely and used well.\n\n"

For example, Pepsi has updated their logo 10 times.\n\nOn the other hand, a fleeting trend might be totally appropriate for a company that needs to conform to current trends; such as a company that caters to the whims of teenagers. Obviously they don't want to change their logo every year, but other elements of branding can be revised frequently, especially if the branding is mostly online, which is easy to update as trends change.\n\n"
