Most of them are verbs - maybe find a verb that works for Pleasure or Scent (you already have smell). You could use a word like Enjoy or Savor or Relax for Pleasure.\n\n"

I don�t now why.   \n   \nOk Patricia I go to try to explain in my poor English the project.   \nIt�s a small coffee shop in an airport and I need to create a logo and all the graphic material to apply in the wall, balcony and furniture. I think to work images in the Photoshop connect to exotic and pleasure places� and cross the images whit lines and points [like city spots in the map], but I want to replace the usual city our country names by words in different languages connect to the pleasure of travelling, know new places, learn about other cultures and costumes, taste new food, drinks and flavours� also I plain to use another graphic elements connect to the travel idea.   \nEnjoy and Savour is good words for Scent. But do you think Relax meaning the same as Pleasure? In Portuguese Relax is more like peace of mind and body and Pleasure is more like the excitement to know and participate in something new [like the smell and taste of a espresso].\n\n"
