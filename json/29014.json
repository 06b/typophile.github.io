  "content": "Hi All —  \nI have recently been experimenting with making patterns using the extra ornaments found in Bickam Script. Having not been able to produce anything more than mediocre designs so far, I began wondering if there were any rules pertaining to the usage of this type of ornament. Are there specific no-no’s that I should avoid? Are there any general guidelines that I could use as a starting point? (specifically overlapping/spacing issues and how to choose which curly-cues to pair with one another) Or should I just keep practicing and stop wasting everyone’s time?\n\nThanks,  \nEric\n\n",

It’s my favourite font and I think the caps are just lovely but i got right bollocked by my senior designer! Come to think of it it was a bit hard to read but worth it i thought.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the quick response. I wouldn’t use Bickham Script in all caps, but almost getting fired for it seems a little harsh. I am interested more specifically with the supplimental ornamnets, not the actual characters, in Bickham Script and others, such as Poetica. Any thoughts on that?\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Eroc,\n\nMy senior designer is a real tosser sometimes. I do like Poetica but find it overwhelming. Aren’t there 200 ampersands in that one? I’d trade them all for the perfect N! I believe the saying with Bickham is that ‘less is more’ and I’ve gotten in the habit of using the smaller flourish on the end of every other line and the big flourish only when it’s really important like at the end of the bride’s name, because you can’t beat Bickham for a wedding invitation! I’ve never had a chance to use the big loopy ones because they never quite seem to fit in but aren’t they gorgeous?\n\n"
