Glad I could get you to post - finally, pictures where I am not captured looking like a fool. If no half-split surfaces, the license is yours, if you want it.   \n   \nYves - don't worry about the misspelling. But hooray for me indeed. \\*cough\\*buynobel\\*cough\\*   \n   \nLord of the Ring - thanks. But being pretty and being unphotogenic are two different things - I know how many photos people had to delete because I was blinking, or my mouth was hanging open catching flies, or just generally looking much worse in two dimensions than I do in three. But at any rate, prettiness has nothing to do with type. You should see me when I work. It's giant glasses, frizzy hair, and frumpy clothes all day long.   \n   \nNow where is the picture of my split? Huh? HUH?!\n\n"
