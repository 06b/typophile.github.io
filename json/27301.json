  "content": "I've been asked to redesign a diary – mostly from a typographic point of view. The example show uses Apple Chancery and Helvetica. I'd like to bring it up to date. What type is \"in\" for 2006? Can anyone one subject a good combination of type? (in the format of title/body combo).\n\nI'm new to working with type so any subjections would be gratefully received.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [diary.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021000442/http:/typophile.com/files/diary.gif) | 11.97 KB |\n\n",

Has to have an unusual mix of corporate and rural/rustic.\n\nUnfortunately I've don't own any of the font you mention (and the budget won't stretch to buying new ones).\n\nBut thanks for the input. I like that Parisine font. Wonder how it works as body copy.\n\n"
