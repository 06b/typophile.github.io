  "content": "Can anybody shed any information on how to repair my fonts folder / strip it down to just the default fonts in Windows (XP)? I have been using Linotypes Font Explorer BETA and after a couple of installs / reinstalls/ uninstalls I seem to have corrupted things. A few of my fonts in the MS programs are not displaying correctly/wonrg fonts being used.\n\nAny ideas how to just revert to the defualt Windows fonts? Currently when looking at my fonts folder it just appears full of shortcuts rather than fonts. I don’t think this is due to Suitcase which I am now using.\n\nAlso - on a side note - anyone know if Font Explorer will EVER see the light of day in a non beta version? I love it on the Mac but would love to have it workin properly on my PC at work as Suitcase kinda sucks....\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ I need help with Font Lab!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080630214224/http:/typophile.com/node/46049 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Copy to Composites Macro - RoboFab ? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080630214224/http:/typophile.com/node/46021 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I can’t honestly recall.\n\nMicrosoft have a list of the fonts supplied with the OS so I guess you could Find Files & Folders for these on your system to see if the program moved them, then move ’em back to the Windows/Fonts/ directory manually. [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/winxp.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20080630214224/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/winxp.htm)\n\nPersonally I use [High-Logic’s MainType 2.1](http://web.archive.org/web/20080630214224/http:/www.high-logic.com/maintype.html) which works very well for $49. No install needed either so I can keep it on a flash drive.\n\n"

Fwiw, several font management vendors are working on improved Windows products. The next year should be good in this regard.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
