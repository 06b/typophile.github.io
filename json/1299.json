I need to find a way to make this one stand out a little more from the rest of the transitional faces. The second 'k' is starting to get there, I think. I would welcome any suggestions.   \n   \ncr\n\n<center><table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417082959im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_gif.gif\" align=\"LEFT\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">no26<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417082959/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/no_26_viewer.swf\"><b>no_26_viewer.swf</b></a> (9 k)</td></tr></table></center>!-/attachment-!\\>!-attachment:\\> \n",

Is it all pen tool operations, or are there other methods, like Christian's.?   \n   \nbj\n\n"

      "content": "This design presents a dilemma.   \nTo me the centerpiece is the \"g\" (although it could just be me) - it can be argued that the join between the bowls (in the traditional bicam structure) is superfluous, and you've gotten rid of it very nicely: on its own your glyph looks like a legitimate alphabetic character.   \n   \nThe question is, how much of that approach do you apply to the other letters? The \"a\" works well, and the \"p\" has merit, but if you take it too far the font might become a parody. In fact it's not inconceivable to me to make \\*only\\* the \"g\" unorthodox, and build the rest as a traditional text face. The interesting result might be a font that some people will discredit as half-baked, some people will love without knowing -or caring- why, and \\*everybody\\* will have something to saw about that \"g\" - in part a promotional trick that Carter often mentions as Spiekermann having revealed to him (concerning Meta, although it could very well have been post-rationalization).   \n   \nIf you do that, you must not provide a traditional \"g\" as an alternate.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "There has been some discussion in these forums about faces that have only one or two odd-ball characters. It seems that some don't like them, but I really do. It seems like a good way to push the boundries of what's acceptable. They also makes for really interesting text faces, I think. I don't think that the 'speed bump' created by some wacky characters really causes a problem, if they are done right. For some reason g's and Q's give a lot of room for expression, but I also really like the 'a' and the 'k' for their expressive potential.   \n   \nI am undecided about the a and the p, to be completely honest. They almost seem contrived, like they are an excuse to keep the g that I like so much. I don't think that I would provide an alternate g, though I did right here...   \n   \nNote to BJ- I think you still have a flash 4 player.

They become not speed bumps, but \"feedback\" from the road to the driver.   \n   \nCould you set some text in this?   \n   \n\\> a and the p, to be completely honest.
