It's definitely something that can be used as a display, but if you just took an existing typeface and applied filters to it, there may be legal issues. It's a good start though.\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry I haven't gotten back to all of you sooner. I was just reminded by a friend of mine that I had some responses.   \nI guess I need to explain my process a little more. To start with I took a typeface, made some alterations, crumpled the paper, took digital pictures of each individual letterform in 3 different light settings. Then I took these images and manipulated them in Streamline. The high contrast and conversion I applied helped erase my letterforms to my goal. I hope this helps. Also, in response to Eduardo- I actually think the Frothy typeface looks very similar to a fellow student's design-Tetanus. I think it is also posted on here. Both Frothy and Tetnus remind me a lot of Baskerville.   \nFor legallity purposes, I'm not intending to sell this. Just for personal use and for my class project. Thank you!\n\n"

Taking an existing   \ntypeface and changing it, it's not as innovative as it may sound.   \n   \nCan I ask you a question? Why did you choose Stone Sans to   \nplay with? It was the same typeface used in Frothy.   \n   \n   \n_\\>Both Frothy and Tetnus remind me a lot of Baskerville._   \n   \nI don't wanna be picky, but how can a modern serif typeface   \nremind you of a nineties grunge one? ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "Eduardo- I understand you were sharing with me what you thought was similar. I also understand that changing an existing typeface is not so good. What I wanted to do, was to work with it and to create a typeface that appeared unwanted, used, and all that remained was this new design. I didn't realize that I along with the Frothy designer had such a pull to Stone Sans. Just kind of odd I guess. I thought Tetnus looked a bit like Baskerville because I think that is one of the types she used to base her typeface on.   \n   \nOn another note, any suggestions on what to use this typeface on? I'm trying to brainstorm for my specimen posters......just looking for open feedback from everyone. I am hoping for a better idea than for a landfill flyer. Thanks!!!\n\n"
