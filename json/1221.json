  "content": "Hi All.   \nI've been working on and off with a collection of typefaces for my conceptual foundry Brainreactor/GyoDea. The collection starts to take shape, and I would be glad of any comments regarding my work.   \n   \nThe collection contains both display/experimental and some sans serifs for Display/Logo purposes.   \n   \nI appologize for the pdf layout in this preview, I work on a book where all the fonts will be displayed in a proper way.   \n   \nAll typefaces have full alphabets with upper- and lowercase letters, numbers and so on. However, I think it's a bit early to show them all in here. I have 24 other full alphabets going on on top of the ones I show here. I will upload a new pdf within two weeks, with more and harder experimental Typefaces.   \n   \nAny comments?   \n   \nAndreas Lindholm\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"> <img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043132im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" alt=\"\"><br> 999.2 K </td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> Fonts_Preview_01.pdf<br> <b>\"Preview Brainreactor/GyoDea\"</b> </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n</center>\n",

These types will probably only be used in flyers, poster, CD covers, etc. Therefor they are OK, if you ask me. They are more peaces of artwork than types.   \nWhere BD made more readible type, in the shape of futuristic forms, you go more autonome. It's your personal decision and that's fine.   \n   \nDon't stop bringing them out. You will find people that want to buy them.   \n   \nRegards,   \nRen\n\n"

Some people wanted the fonts only and asked me how to get them without buying the book. Back in 2000, I was making the site in that purpose. I still get some dollars from it. The site is almost 4 years old, and some of the fonts are 8 years old. Still going strong in some computers... Thanks for your comments!   \n   \n\\>Ren\n\n"

In fact, my love of type comes directly from my love for words and the act of expression through writing.   \n   \nFor this simple reason, I have no problems at all with the readability of individual characters, or even the readability of a word, so long as its aesthetic expression is dramatic and intelligent. It may take a moment of adjustment to pick up the letterforms, but it is the artfullness of the type that demands I invest my attention in the word it represents.   \n   \nWhat I mean to say is, there are more uses for type than just stringing together complete sentences or paragraphs. I do not see any need to compare your work to more mainstream samples or useage.   \n   \nThere is a definate place for your type: right on the cutting edge.   \n   \nWherever there are words written in the throws of anxiety, anger, excitement, suprise, nearly any condition of extremety, your letterforms shine appropriate.\n\n"
