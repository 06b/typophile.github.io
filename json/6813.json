These photographs are the very first colour photographs in the world. Furthermore, one of the most beautiful fine art books I ever owned is \"Aphrodite�s Cup\", a book of erotic woodcuts by George Kuthan.   \n [http://lanstontype.com/Westman&Baker.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051932/http:/lanstontype.com/Westman&Baker.html)   \nI have chosen not to show the book as I can see the forum has some malignant Victorian standards which I consider the most sexually bizarre attitude in modern times. The seeding of dirty minds.   \n  \nAphrodite's Cup is pure art, and a work we should celebrate rather than go Catholic in our critique.   \n   \nAllow me, as old fashioned as I seem to all of you, I believe it is possible in the digital world to produce digital pornography that should be just as acceptable as marble pornography, or wood cut pornography.   \n   \nTo my eye sex is a beautiful thing, there is nothing is dirty about it. That is, unless it is the product of religious and social suppression. (or re-action to it) In otherwords many people think veils is oppressive to women, braziers are oppressive to women and naked woman undressed making love is oppressive to women.   \n   \nWell, if that's the case, we may as well live with less rather than more. Or do you like veils and think women dirty when on their periods. Is female circumcision bad where male circumcision is good?   \n   \nGo figure?\n\n"

Porn, feminism, sexuality, these mean many different things to many different people. By using these words, you can't assume that people know exactly what you are talking about. There are branches of feminism that are pro-sexuality and pro-men, believe it or not, and obviously those that are against men AND porn.   \n   \nSo what exactly are we talking about here? Is all exploration of sexual identity and desire porn, and therefore does that make all people who are interested and passionate about their sexuality violaters and abusers of women's sexuality? Every type of media produced about sex is not porn. It's like trying to argue the exact nature of what art is, it's so different for so many people, unless you know exactly what people mean by saying that word, there's no point.   \n   \nI don't doubt that some forms of porn ARE abusive and degrading to women. But I would like to see some acceptance that some porn is empowering, intelligent and engaging, to both men and women, and perhaps we all need to accept that this is, like many things, not a clear, black and white issue.\n\n"

      "content": "I don't think it's off topic, given the topic. Personally, I'm with Zara on this one. But that's just my opinion, of course. At the same time, I consider myself strongly pro-feminist. (I used to say I was a feminist, but some folks claim that it's not possible for a male to be a feminist. Whatever.)   \n   \nI'm just suspicious of arguments that porn is degrading only to women. Sometimes I think some of that belief stems from a conservative anti-sexuality viewpoint that says women can't possibly enjoy sex as much as men.   \n   \nAn interesting feature of the porn industry is that if anyone is degraded, it can be argued that is at least as degrading to men as to women. Male porn actors are paid a small fraction of what the women are paid, they don't get the same kind of billing and very few become stars. And certainly what's required of the male actors is more demanding. Yet in hard core porn, they are more likely to be just mobile genitals in the movies, while the women are central characters. If women are the sexual objects of desire in porn, then men are just the desire itself.   \n   \nSo, I guess I am more likely to buy an argument that porn is degrading to people in general. But even that is an oversimplification to me. What I \\*do\\* absolutely believe is that in the absence of other information and role models about sexual relationships, most porn, when viewed by people whose attitudes towards sex are not fully developed, has the potential to create unhealthy expectations and denigrate the value of emotional intimacy and love in a sexual relationship. On the plus side, most porn at least teaches that sex is fun, which is a Good Thing in my book.   \n   \nProbably there are a lot of companies/people in the porn industry I wouldn't want to work for. But I'm pretty sure there are at least a few that I would be willing to do design work for. And almost all I'd be willing to do expert witness, document verification kinds of work for.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

      "content": "JFP: _I wonder about the survey you launched? Are you in front of such dilema yourself?_   \n   \nNo, but it is something that I think about from time to time. One of the troubling aspects of the current configuration of capital is that it is very difficult to find any company that is not in some way connected, e.g. by investment, to other companies. So even if one wants to avoid working for e.g. war profiteers, one can never be certain that one is not in some way contributing to businesses that one thinks unethical.   \n   \n   \nRegarding porn, I don't doubt that there are more and less abusive and exploitative examples and, if there is to be porn I doubt if many reasonable people would disagree that it would be better run by women and with guarantees to respect the rights and dignity of the participants. But before we start talking about some porn being 'empowering\\*, intelligent and engaging' we might ponder whether those things are, in fact, part of the distinction between the pornographic and the erotic. Most legal definitions of pornography centre on the functional intent, in which pornography is judged to be _solely_ intended to provoke sexual arousal, which suggests that if the intent is e.g. to intellectually engage one may already be moving beyond the merely pornographic. I think this is a useful way to look at the question, and worth maintaining rather than blurring the line between the pornographic and the erotic in a way that can only benefit the makers of degrading and exploitative material.   \n   \nAll that said, I'm basically in agreement with William on the characteristic nature of porn. But will add that porn is as degrading to the consumer as to the women (and men and children) who are consumed. The reduction of human beings to sexual objects of animal gratification is inherently degrading, because we are capable of -- and, I would say, made for -- so much more.   \n   \n   \n\\* I don't believe there is any such thing as 'empowerment': it is a jargon-driven illusion marketed to the economically, socially or politically disenfranchised to convince them that their situation is a subjective problem of self-worth, rather than an objective state of injustice. It is the language of diversion: among other things, the process by which feminism in North America has been diverted into the dead-end of identity and gender politics and away from economic and social justice.\n\n"

I literally can't remember not knowing where babies come from, either.   \n   \nBut my own experiences aside, for a very long time the predominant message about sex in the English-speaking countries was that it was dirty and sinful.

But I think that people are empowered either by achieving economic and social justice, or by being given access to the levers of power that will enable them to achieve that justice.

What bothers me about the backlash of the sexual revolution (apart from epidemics of sexually transmitted disease) is the commodification of human beings and the sexualisation of children through advertising. The USA has always been a country of extremes, and the tendency, in sex as in much else, is to exchange one set of extremes for another: puritanism for license, perpetuated by the fact that 'sex sells'. And, of course, anyone who even suggests that there might be some appropriate balance is will be accused of being censorious, of denying 'expression', etc. by people who willfully ignore the great emotional and physical misery that ensues from treating people as objects.\n\n"

To start with you have Saint Paul saying that celebacy is spiritually superior. Then you have for example, Augustine: \"A good Christian is bound to love in one and the same woman [his wife] the creature of God whom he desired to be transformed and renewed, but to hate in her the corruptible and mortal conjugal connection, sexual intercourse and all that pertains to her as a wife.\" [De Sermone Dom. in Monte, 41.] And Pope Gregory the Great \"Sensual pleasure can never be without sin.\" And even in the current Catholic Church many view sex within marriage as \"mere tolerated in view of procreation (New Catholic Encyclopaedia, Annual 1988, p 414)   \n   \nThere is a long Christian tradition of seeing the body as corrupt, and sexual desire as inherently sinful. I think that both this tradition and the 'modernest' reaction to it, which I objected to Zara about, are harmful to human happiness and well being.   \n   \nAs John noted, my touchstone for sound views of sexuality put human wellbeing first. My views are informed by Jewish views of sexuality, which are at odds with Christian ones, but I also object to traditional Jewish views where I think they are at odds with human wellbeing.   \n   \nMy objections to Zara's views, and sexual modernism, have to do with their very harmful effect on human happiness, and in particular leading to the destruction of love.\n\n"

      "content": "_...the view of sex as inherently sinful is mainstream traditional Christian..._    \n   \nWell, even noting that you ignored my ironical smiley, this is a gross simplification. The tension between the flesh and the spirit necessarily makes sex a complex issue for any religion that takes the interior life seriously. Christianity, like Judaism, puts limits on the appropriate expression of sexuality, for social, moral and spiritual reasons, limiting it to marriage, for instance, and in the case of Catholicism and Orthodoxy also affirming chastity and celibacy _as expressions of sexuality._ And yes this has sometimes led some to puritanism and a denial of all sensual pleasure, especially in that period when Greek and Roman converts imported stoicism into Christianity or, in the case of St Augustine, remnant Manichaeanism. But to cite a few readings -- only one canonical and that clearly not saying that sex is inherently sinful -- to suggest that this is the predominant teaching of mainstream Christianity is unfair. The wholesale condemnation of sensual pleasure has long been understood as contrary to the belief that the physical order was created by God and is fundamentally good: a basic teaching that is reaffirmed by the Magisterium when puritanism, stoicism or Manichaeanism rear their heads. What _is_ mainstream is the observation that lust, i.e. selfish sexual desire for physical gratification, is one of the most pervasive distractions of the spirit away from God, hence it is counted as one of the deadly sins: those sins that by habit come to replace God in the human heart. Obviously, in this perspective, sexuality that is directed toward physical gratification as its sole or primary goal -- e.g. pornography -- is disordered. By the same token, not everything that is erotic is pornographic or in the nature of lust.   \n   \nI'll also note that, like most other things in North America, Catholicism here has been more touched by puritanism than in, say, Italy. A friend of mine who has led groups of North American pilgrims to Rome has observed their shock when they encounter the frankness of fleshy humanity in the paintings and statues that adorn many churches.   \n   \nAnd yes, the Church still teaches that sex is _primarily_ ordered to procreation, and that sex from which the possibility of procreation has been deliberately removed is disordered. But it does not teach that procreation is the sole purpose of sex or of human sexuality. Rather, sex is understood to be a wholeness, involving flesh, mind and spirit open to the gifts of God, including spiritual gifts, emotional gifts and the gift of life. What is sinful is to reduce it or to subtract from it any part of that wholeness, so that it becomes a shadow of what it is meant to be. This wholeness is well expressed in the official statements of the Church, e.g. the recent Catechism: 'Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others.' [Article 2332]   \n   \nI should note that when I talk about religion, I am not expecting anyone outside my religion to agree with me or to conform to the direct moral implications of what I believe. I'm just explaining where I'm coming from. On the other hand, I don't believe that things are immoral because the Bible or the Church teach that they are: I believe the Bible and the Church teach that they are immoral because they are immoral, and can frequently be demonstrated to be immoral on purely natural and secular grounds as causing misery, undermining social bonds, leading to illness and death, etc. I'm very well aware, having lived for many years as an atheist, that some aspects of Catholic morality make little sense 'from the outside'. That is, I wouldn't expect any non-Catholic to abide by the Church's teaching on contraception, for example. Without conversion, without first turning toward to God and seeking His will, one isn't likely to perceive the fractured, or at best partial, nature of sexuality that closes itself off to the gift of life.   \n   \n_My objections to Zara's views, and sexual modernism, have to do with their very harmful effect on human happiness, and in particular leading to the destruction of love._   \n   \nIn this observation, we are completely in agreement.\n\n"

Often they seem like well- or thinly-disguised versions of pleasure-is-bad. Maybe I'm just projecting my prejudices.   \n   \nBut my own view is pretty straightforward. Pleasure is inherently good--but that principle applies to everyone, and over time.   \n   \nThat is, things are good that create pleasure for all affected. But short-term pleasure that causes long-term unhappiness is probably a bad idea. I think that most people have some (usually a lot of) emotional involvement in having sex, so for most people having sex with random people they've just met is a bad idea. Not because it's immoral, but because it is has a good chance of leading to unhappiness.   \n   \nRelatively casual sex is often a symptom of other kinds of unhappiness or insecurity or feeling unloved. This too doesn't make it bad; just an outlet or a way of trying to paper over other emotional issues. As long as it doesn't simply create more unhappiness (for example, through guilt, or feeling rejected when the casual partner doesn't remain interested), there's nothing \\*wrong\\* with it.

The desire for sensual pleasure is very strong in most people, so if an individual is serious about developing the inner life, some measure of denial and a deliberate attempt to control desire is simply necessary, not because sensual pleasure is wrong or evil or sinful, but because it gets in the way and distracts the mind from contemplation.

In The Confessions, Augustine went to GREAT lengths to deny himself of any pleasure. In fact, that brilliant yet extremely repressed man spent his entire life avoiding pleasure. But hey, those confessions were essentially the beginning of western psychology as we know it. So I am glad he went through all that (in my first life I studied the psychology of religion).   \n   \nIf there was a religion that took seriously the need for carnal pleasure (within measure) working in harmony with a spiritual awareness/focus then I have not found one.

I'm firmly convinced that the social acceptability of alcohol is based in the fact that wine and beer and scotch etc. _taste good_.

This is why alcohol is socially acceptable while most other mind altering drugs are not: no one drops MDA because they like the taste, the only reason to take it is for the psycho-chemical effects. In the same way, pornography is concerned solely with animal arousal and gratification (following the traditional and legal distinction between pornography and erotica).
