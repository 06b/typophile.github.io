Most of them though, there are no information as to where they are from, who shot the picture, and the people on it. It' part of the charm and mystic.\n\nI wanted to pick a type that was not elegant, but maybe trying too, or just an old weary elegance. The logo could be an acronym, so Lost & Found Stock could be typesetted \"L&F stock\".\n\nI've attached two examples. I have fine-tuned anything, these are just too give a good idea of what I was thinking. I'm looking for any advice, tips or critiques, and I'm specifically looking for alternative ampersands for the script-logo, because I don't like the current one.\n\nThe typefaces used are Paperback (serif) and Dear Sarah (script), and H&FJ's Historical FellType (alternative ampersand)\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Paperback Acro.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130618031642/http:/typophile.com/files/Paperback%20Acro.jpg) | 16.28 KB |\n| [Dear\\_Sarah.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130618031642/http:/typophile.com/files/Dear_Sarah.jpg) | 20.68 KB |\n| [Dear\\_Sarah\\_Alt2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130618031642/http:/typophile.com/files/Dear_Sarah_Alt2.jpg) | 19.08 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I like how you are starting with the L&F mark. I think it could use a little tightening of the space between the L and F. \"Stock\" should be smaller so it properly aligns with L&F or it should expand beyond (and not just a smidge, enough so it looks intentional) on both sides. Personally I lean toward having it align but play with the design.\n\nSet ampersands in every font you own and see which appeal to you. Look at samples from foundries, and practice drawing your own - you will strike upon an idea that inspires you and then develop it more.\n\nYou need to determine the name. Will it be Lost & Found Stock, or L&F Stock? Do you want to be able to use both - if so you need to work on both now. Your Dear Sarah samples are an ok start but using Dear Sarah for your L&F design might not work so well.\n\nWith the name Lost & Found it might be interesting to have your logotype look like it was put together by mixed pieces. By that I mean different typefaces. It's a great name for a stock collection. Maybe you should try old wood block letters or something that has a corrosive rubber stamp feel.\n\nKeep working at it, would like to see more postings.\n\n"

I'm a bit nervous that the third will end up too fuzzy n small sizes (seing as it has three rings instead of two in the first, and one in the second). But on the other hand, I find the second frame slightly boring as well. Maybe that's a good thing though with all the ornaments in the type.\n\nWhat do you think about the tiny one? Is it too small and unreadable? Does the ampersand look a beer label when being filled with white?\n\n"

There is zero chance i would ever give my credit card info to a company branded like this as i would be worried about some 17 year old kid running off with my bank details.\n\nIs it supposed to be Victorian? Because i don't get that at all. Its kind of country and western, reminds me of a belt buckle i bought in Nashville. Did you think about paul's idea? I really feel that has a lot of potential. i guess i'm just confused, i just don't understand what its trying to convey, what its supposed to mean.\n\nOh, and the colour (or lack thereof) needs more thought - too bland, imagine it on a an A4 cream/white letterhead....yikes!\n\n"

      "content": "Actually David, you were the one that introduced the concept 'Victorian', not me. I agree with most of what you said, but maybe you're judging the logo development too heavily under your search for \"good old victorian photos for a current\".\n\nWhen you mention belt & buckle from Nashville, you're actually not spot on for some of the photos in the collection! It's a diverse body of photos, most of them having a sense of melancholy, humour & nostalgia in them – in my mind.\n\nI leaned towards a script type because I wanted to associate with the signatures people have put on their old photos from time to time (and which the collection preserved in the digital form). Also, the obvious historical and nostalgic aspect of it.\n\nBy the way, people seemed to presume I was the creator of the collection, but this is not the case.\n\nAgreeing with David, my biggest problem seems to be the fuzziness at small sizes. I guess this is a general problem with script-type, so I'm a bit uncertain what to do. Could you perhaps explain more in detail why you like the signage-approach? I tried to make a logo with rubber stamps, but couldn't use the technique properly, I might need some practise. Maybe later again..\n\n"

I did check out Brothers the first time you posted it, but didn't notice the type specimen and all the little cool \"and\" & \"vs.\"-style symbols.\n\nI actually thought about doing an \"and\" with two ornaments instead of an ampersand, it just didn't seem to work in small sizes. I think this is where the photo collage idea fails as well: it won't communicate the photos in small sizes. Unfortunately, the logo will appear mostly in this size - on a website. Too bad, because there are so many cool approaches to this logo, just that they take up some space to be justified..\n\n"

      "content": "Malte, I still like your last posting. The ampersand was going to need an alternate solution to work at the smaller sizes though. To me your latest design said elegant and by-gone era. However, after reading more descriptions of the photo collection that direction may not be the most suitable. The formal script is sophisticated, but not at all like the actual writing you would find on someone's old family photographs. I do very much like David's suggestion of using Brothers, a definite cool vintage feel. You are right, there are so many directions to go in. Look at the collection, what adjectives would you use to describe it? nostalgic? quirky? vintage? elegant? Victorian? retro? funky? moody? off beat? whatever that essence is try to incorporate it into your design. The palette is subtle (some say boring) but I thought it was appropriate for the subject - old photographs - black, white, gray, sepia, beige. Looking forward to your next post.\n\n"
