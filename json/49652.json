It is common practice for designers to modify a few letters of a font when designing logos. When this is done well it makes the logo more distinctive, when it’s done poorly it looks like garbage.\n\nIf you need to recreate this logo I would try converting Avant Garde to outlines in Illustrator then modifying the e, r, n, and T to match.\n\n"
