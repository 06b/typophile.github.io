The designers came from the same school and the same influences, but PMN Caecilia is more coherent than TheSerif (formerly known as Thesis Serif).\n\nFor what it’s worth: I have used Caecilia extensively for headlines as well as text (which I preferred slightly compressed, say to 92 or 94%), and have combined it with for instance Metro Sans (Bold) for captions and such, or with Avenir (that has some of that Neo-Humanist quality that Caecilia has too.\n\nPMS Caecilia is one of my all time favorites, as you might guess : )\n\nWeb equivalent? Not amongst the usual suspects, I am afraid.\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

I do understand that one's typos and inadvertent errors do not normally need to be pointed out, but in this case, the error seemed somewhat humorous, and I thought you and others might enjoy noting it.
