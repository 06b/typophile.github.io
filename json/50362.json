  "content": "Hi, folks out there.\n\nI’ve just been reading the March discussion of book design charges.\n\nI come from about 30 years of overall graphic design experience — corporate, publishing, whatever.\n\nI’ve just recently shifted my focus to designing memoirs and books on spirituality, art and poetry.\n\nI’m working with individuals now, not companies or university presses and I wondered if anyone else out there has any experience in this.\n\nPattyfab, I love your work. I used your pricing methods for a memoir project that I did over the summer. But it was for a high-end client. I don’t think these kinds of prices will work for those who aren’t high end.\n\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions beyond the previous thread of book design fees?\n\nThanks!\n\nRobin\n\n [‹ font id please](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013050605/http:/typophile.com/node/50409 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lakotah Typography ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013050605/http:/typophile.com/node/50400 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

After a while one gets pretty good at estimating how much time a project will take, which clients can and are willing to pay a higher rate, and even which projects you can narrow your margins on to “help” the client - but always be careful with that last one. Price setting can help convey the idea of quality and expertise of the product or service but push too far to an extreme and you’ll either lose opportunities or gain ones that are not worth having.\n\n"
