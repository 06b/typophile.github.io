  "content": "A question for book designers:\n\nHow do you feel about setting a classic text in a modern (as in contemporary, not as in Romantic) face? Would you see this as an unforgivable act of heresy?\n\nFor instance, suppose someone commissioned you to design a \"modern-looking\" edition of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_. Some would argue that this text, originally published in 1865, should be set in an English (or at least British) face of about the same time. Among the more familiar faces, you would have Bell, Baskerville and Bulmer -- even though I believe they're all from the 1700s, not the 1800s.\n\nWould you consider \"modernizing\" Carroll's classic -- or any other classic -- through design a ludicrous proposition? If not, what would be your approach?\n\n",

On the other hand Shakespeare is often (sometimes successfully) performed in \"modern\" settings.\n\nSetting a book should be less about modernising than presenting it in as well as possible, as long as it doesn't interfere with the pleasure of reading it I can't see any problem with using a contemporary face.  \nTim\n\n"

But weighing in on the original question: I don't think typefaces have to come from the same time period or locale as where the text originated. I think the most important consideration is that the typeface \"honors\" the text. What would be really interesting to me (but maybe this is too Wizard of Oz) would be to have a more conservative typeface for Alice in the real world and something a bit more weird for when she crosses over into Wonderland. I would love to see Alice in a more impressionistic type, maybe something like [Serapion](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015013718/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/index.php?id=43) or [Biblon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015013718/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/index.php?id=11).\n\n"

We were discussing something very similar over in [_About Minion_](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015013718/http:/typophile.com/node/27323).\n\nI would go one step further and say, at the risk of being stoned to death right here, that most signs of typographic refinement are completely lost on the reading audience.\n\nI'm not suggesting we all just give up and start using nothing but Times New Roman. However, if we're going to be realistic, I think the cold truth is that the overwhelming majority of readers won't see anything wrong with The Hound of the Baskervilles set in a 17th-century French face.\n\nAnyway, my point is that there would be little or no room for typographic refinement if our only concern were those things that actually affect the majority of readers. (Determining what does affect readers would in turn require extensive research, which is even further off topic.)\n\nI quite like the idea of two different faces for AIW, with a wacky one for Wonderland.\n\n`I think the most important consideration is that the typeface \"honors\" the text.`\n\nI completely agree, Paul. But I suspect that a typographer's concern with honouring content isn't always compatible with a publisher's idea of how a book should be \"packaged\" so that it cost as little as possible to produce and sell as much as possible.\n\n"

Both the text and Tenniel's illustrations are in the public domain, so the financial investment would be minimal.\n\nSince I don't want to invest in new faces for this experimental project, I've been considering either Quadraat (pretty \"whimsical\", I would say) or Esprit, but wonder if the latter would be really suitable for a book -- or at least most of it, if I use a face for the real world and another for wonderland. Also, perhaps Esprit is too rococo for the text. (I tried asking about the use of Esprit for extended text in another topic but didn't get any replies, so I'm removing it.)\n\nRe. Tenniel's illustrations, as a child I used to find them rather spooky. Granted, AIW is hardly a book for modern children -- too long, for one thing. Still, in order to make the illustrations slightly less scary, I was thinking of perhaps \"illustratoring\" them a little to make them look more like paintings. Would that be an unforgivable desecration of Tenniel's work?\n\n"
