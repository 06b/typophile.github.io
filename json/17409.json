Or are they really the same thing? Just different names for what we now call sans-serif?\n\n",

But the name is so firmly established in American usage as meaning a plan block letter without serifs or hairline, that we must accept that meaning. Also, it is part of many type names. But we prefer to go further, and reserve the term gothic for the traditional forms, and san serif for the modified forms orginating in Germany with the Bauhaus movement of the 1920s. Our preferrred general term is serifless.\n\nfirst portion of text from p. 155.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> American ATF inspired/derivative typeface from Akzidenz Grotesque.\n\nI don’t see how Franklin Gothic has much to do with Akzidenz Grotesque. Franklin Gothic has more thick-thin contrast, and the two story g, the s doesn’t close on itself, the top terminal of the c is fatter than the bottom, etc etc.\n\nAlternate Gothic is condensed, and, looking at my old edition of Jaspert,resembles the condensed versions of Akzidenz (Standard),except with the two story g. But the condensed versions of Akzidenz (Standard) don’t look much like the regular and wider versions of Akzidenz, which seem to be the basis for Helvetica.\n\nIt may well be that Benton had German sources for Alternate Gothic. But Franklin seems to me very unlikely to have come from Akzidenz. More likely a redrawing of existing American faces, I would guess.\n\nIs there an historian out there who can give us the correct story?\n\n"
