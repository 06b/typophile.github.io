      "content": "The stonecutter would have used the lettering styles that were familiar to him rather than a font as such. Note that the 1936 lettering has some minor differences from the 1900s lettering.  \nThe earlier lettering can be reproduced with some success by using a font such as Dharma Gothic, which is modeled on 19th century woodtype similar to the lettering. See [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-gothic/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317154811/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-gothic/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-gothic/\")  \nAs for the numbers they are again the stonecutter's idea of what is appropriate. Note the clear differences between the 1913 and 1936 versions.  \nDon\n\n"
