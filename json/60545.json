I have been a silent viewer for a while now.  \nI've written [an applet](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203101631/http:/alecjacobson.com/programs/font/java) that allows the user to compare any two fonts on her machine. The applet let's the user fine tune sizes and location allowing for a close-up and detailed font comparison. It's a java applet that runs in the browser (as long as you have java enabled):  \n [http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=89](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203101631/http:/www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=89 \"http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=89\")\n\n[\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203101631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Versus_6191.jpg)\n](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203101631/http:/www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=89)\n\nLet me know what you think and if you have any suggestions for improvements!  \nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "Really cool idea and great execution.\n\nThe only thing I'm questioning is the sole ability to compare fonts on one's own machine. Should there be a way to compare fonts that one doesn't have/own the rights to? Though I'm not sure how that would happen without necessitating a rather hefty online database.\n\nAnyway, like I said, great job so far. And I appreciate the ability to freely move around the two specimens. You may also think about incorporating some form of guide system, so the user can align the two fonts more easily.\n\npenn\n\n"

I totally wish that I could include fonts the user doesn't have/own the rights to.  \nI will look into the possibility of hosting all of my existing fonts (I have quite a few) and then having an option to load (my) external fonts.\n\nGuide system is a great idea. I will certainly throw some graph paper in the background, at least. Do you think \"snapping\" like Adobe products would be worthwhile as an option? Or just an annoyance?\n\n"

Let me know if these features are dumb/too hard to use etc. Thanks.\n\n"

Also scaling should be made more intuitive through a pull down menu as opposed to pushing the left or right arrows. Also, the switch/grid functions should probably be check boxes rather than typed commands.

When I have to combine any two fonts into one document, I always have a go at getting their optical sizes right -- not just the \"point size\".\n\nBut I'm finding my old IE keeps the focus on one of the drop down lists, so I can't use the arrows without selecting another font at the same time ?:(  \n(Don't worry -- I'll try tomorrow on an up-to-date IE.)\n\n"
