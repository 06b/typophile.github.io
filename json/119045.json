The text typeface was called _Liberta Antiqua_.\n\nI am curious if there are digitizations of this typeface. Or, if not, which typeface would be a good approximation of it.\n\nThanks :-)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414113736im_/http:/typophile.com/files/liberta-antiqua_3425.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Trybuna \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Michel Boyer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414113736/http:/typophile.com/user/18942 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [liberta-antiqua.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414113736/http:/typophile.com/files/liberta-antiqua.jpg) | 137.51 KB |\n\n",

Looks like I can download the font from e.g. [myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414113736/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/trybuna/), though not directly through [Ralph's website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414113736/http:/www.dtp-studio-unger.de/fontdesign.html). Indeed, Trybuna looks _very_ close to what's on that text page!\n\nThe only difference is in the German character ß which I like better in its \"original\" printed form :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414113736im_/http:/typophile.com/files/trybuna-sz_6298.jpg)\n\nAccording to an email from Ralph: \"es ist einfach ein typographisches Update von mir, da sich die Originalform des „sz“ nach der damaligen „Mode“ richtete.\" (That [the different ß] was a typographic update I made, because the original form of the „sz“ conformed to the „fashion“ of that time.)\n\n"
