That might as well go in regular old liga, since if you've already got the long s in there, you want it to be a default ligature.   \n   \nThe long s + s ligature is also the origin of the German double s character (eszett).   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

What i'd like to happen is for the substitution to be ignored when two s's fall at the end of the word, is that where the \"long s + s\" lig comes in?   \n   \nMore about OT programming... what is the best way to get up to speed in learning some of the more complicated stuff? and learning about such tricks as special ligatures? is that all on the OT FDK forums? Are there any other resources on the web or in print that i can get my hands on? I'm aware of Adobe's forum, that Microsoft has quite about about font development on their pages and that there is another forum for OT development on MSN... am i just not taking good enough advantage of these resources? is there something i'm missing here? any insight/explanation of these resources (and others i may have missed) would help a lot. thanks again for your help.   \n   \nVOLT... that must be the MSN group i'm thinking of...\n\n"

I just went to look at it in one of our glyph complement PDFs, and it seems that isn't a ligature in Adobe Jenson Pro (although there are a ton of long s ligatures). I wonder if I am completely hallucinating this.... It isn't as if I've done any work in this genre myself in the last 5-6 years.   \n   \nAs for the OT programming aspect, this forum is pretty good.

      "content": "Paul,   \n   \nI don't think it's a good idea to incorporate contextual substitutions of the long-s. Depending on the language used, the rules were very different. So for English, the rules are fairly simple, but for example for German, they aren't. The short s is not only used at the end of words, but also, in compound words, the short s is used where a prefix or a stem ends. For example, in \"ansteigen\" (because it's \"an|steigen\"), you would have a long s but in \"austrinken\" you would have a short s (as it's \"aus|trinken\"). Similarly, there are special rules for French, or Polish, or other languages that used long s in the past.   \n   \nTherefore, it's impossible to build a proper universal contextual substitution mechanism. IMVHO, it doesn't make sense to make rules that would only work in one language (e.g. English) but perhaps actually break other languages.   \n   \nAs for the correct form of a ligature long s + short s, I do recommend to look at \\_well-designed\\_ sharp s (\n\n"

      "content": "Paul,   \n   \nthere is no such thing as \"how does the hist feature work anyway\" ;) Application developers may choose several ways to implement the feature.   \n   \nThe OpenType specification:   \n [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features\\_fj.htm#hist](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106150949/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm#hist)   \nsays that the feature should work as a GSUB lookup type 1, i.e. a simple substitution. This means that contextual substitutions should not be used.   \n   \nMicrosoft's Longhorn OpenType Layout implementation enumerates HinstoricalForms as \"boolean\" so it will be just an on/off function, just like ligatures in InDesign.   \n [http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/graphicsmm/overviews/text/typography\\_ovw.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106150949/http:/longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/graphicsmm/overviews/text/typography_ovw.aspx)   \n   \nAFAIK, Adobe InDesign doesn't currently support the \"hist\" feature other than by the Glyphs palette, but may add an \"on/off\" support in future.   \n   \nIt is possible to implement different substitutions rules for different languages. However, (1) the OpenType specification recommends using only GSUB lookup type 1, i.e. simple substitutions (not contextual substitutions) for the feature. (2) As I explained earlier, a properly working contextual \"hist\" feature for many languages would be simply impossible to build, just like a properly working contextual ligatures feature that would substitute \"fi\" or \"fl\" ligatures -- in German, you are allowed to put the \"fl\" ligature in \"anfliegen\" but not in \"auflegen\", because the former is \"an|fliegen\" and the latter is \"auf|legen\". You are not allowed to put ligatures between a prefix and a stem. Supporting this in an automatic way would require dictionary support so it's not really possible to solve it within a font.   \n   \nTherefore, I recommend implementing the \"hist\" feature just using a simple substitution:   \n   \nsub s by long   \n   \nand let the user turn it on and off locally where required.   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam\n\n"
