      "content": "In my opinion the fonts shown in the image are not old fonts, but rather are modern designs, which may or may not be digital fonts. No problem with the sans-serif for BOURBON as mentioned in my earlier posts.  \nBut \"barrel STOUT\" is a real Frankenstein.  \nNotice the differences between these letters and classic italics like Garamond [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/original-garamond-bt/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319224757/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/original-garamond-bt/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/original-garamond-bt/\") and Fleischman [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/fleischman-bt-pro/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319224757/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/fleischman-bt-pro/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/fleischman-bt-pro/\").  \nThe truncated ascenders, the almost vertical slope, the strange tail at the top of b, etc. What's this with a ball serif capital S? And how did square serifs from Egyptian end up on the T and U? This is not to say that someone has not packaged this mish mash as a font.  \nSo if the Frankenfont does not turn up you could make reasonable facsimile of \"barrel\" by editing Fleishman. Other candidates for editing include Verdigris MVB Pro Text [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mbv-verdigris-pro/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319224757/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mbv-verdigris-pro/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mbv-verdigris-pro/\") ITC Cushing [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/cushing/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319224757/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/cushing/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/cushing/\") and Kis [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kis/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319224757/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kis/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kis/\")  \nDon\n\n"
