Alphabets, Inc. called it Box Gothic, but it's also been known as Alwood Box Gothic, Jubilee Wood and Gothic Bold. I've seen the Alphabets version (with the cooler w) as Box Gothic and Jubilee Wood. I suspect the Solotype version may be licensed from Alphabets with a different name since Alphabets was mentioned in the copyright but maybe some miscreant simply renamed it.\n\n"

Some of my old Photo-Lettering books show styles a lot like 'Box Gothic' from long before A\\*I digitized Box Gothic in 1990. To me it seems more likely that A\\*I digitized from an existing source, and Jubilee Wood (the Solotype name) may have been the original name of the wood type that pre-dates film type or digital fonts that copied the style.\n\n"

Like I mentioned above, this may not have been an authorized version of Jubilee Wood and may simply have been A\\*I's BoxGothic renamed. I do realize that these designs existed looong before digital.\n\n"
