The name for the typeface is missing. Help me with your vote!\n\nAfter several years of work a new font family is born.  \nIt combines the traditional forms of an old type face with the innovative character of a sans serif font.\n\nOnly the name is missing. Which proposal fits? Help me with your vote and remarks!\n\n[http://www.mimix.ch/xx\\_font.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016054228/http:/www.mimix.ch/xx_font.php)\n\n",

      "content": "Dear typophiles\n\nThanks for all your suggestions. An the name of the baby is:\n\n_Sintesi. Sans meets serif._\n\nYou would like to express tradition by using a contemporary font? Sintesi might be exactly what you are looking for.\n\nSintesi stands for synthesis – the unification of serif and sans-serif into a contemporary font, which surprises with different facets depending on its application.\n\nIn copy size Sintesi performs like a sans-serif. It is a compact and well readable font that fulfils all requirements of modern digital media.\n\nIn larger sizes, Sintesi unfolds its traditional character. Now, its strong contrast and the perceptible feather-ductus stand out clearly, as we appreciate it in a historical old style face.\n\nSintesi is completed by a suitable italic. Its cursive character has more to do with writing-speed than to its moderate inclination. Therefore Sintesi may be well-suited for many other purposes, not only for emphasising purposes.\n\nThe whole font family consists of 20 styles and offers a wide range of Western and Eastern European special characters, typographical ligatures, uppercase, oldstyle and fraction figures.\n\nStart combining antiquity with modernity!  \nDownload a free trial version of Sintesi with a reduced character set: [www.sintesi.ch](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016054228/http:/www.sintesi.ch/ \"www.sintesi.ch\") – check it out!\n\n"
