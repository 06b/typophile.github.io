  "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI am in love with a custom typeface by Nico Schweizer created for Phaidon's publication of Area. It is called Typ 1441. Lineto sells Schweitzer's Typ 1451 ( [http://lineto.com/1.0/content\\_5.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134200/http:/lineto.com/1.0/content_5.html \"http://lineto.com/1.0/content\\_5.html\")) but it is too wide for my purposes (a design c.v.). I was wondering if anyone could recommend a close match?\n\nThanks much.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134200im_/http:/typophile.com/files/specimen2_5882.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n DIN \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [kthomps5](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134200/http:/typophile.com/user/175823 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
