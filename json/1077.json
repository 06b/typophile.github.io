Further, it will be two-byte font compatible, meaning that large fonts of up to 65,000 characters will be convertible with this version of the program.   \n   \nTransType Pro will be available for both Macintosh and Windows platforms and final release is anticipated late this year. The price of the new program will be US $149.00, but current users of TransType 2 will be able to upgrade for a substantial discount. However, because all users may not need the power of TRPro, it will not replace TR2. Both products will remain on the market and continue to be supported and updated.\n\n",
