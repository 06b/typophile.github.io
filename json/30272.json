      "content": "Looks pretty good to me so far, but I'm sure others with more authority in inspecting the curves will have more to say about that than I.\n\nThe internal up-hooks in the h, k, m, and n are pretty distracting to me, as they interrupt the flow of what one expects to see as a single stroke. Likewise with the top loops on b, d, h, k, and l, though it seems more of a stylistic decision than the afforementioned up-hooks. At least by the way I learned cursive, the connecting stroke from the b should come from the top, similar to the o and v, so this one looks a bit off to me.\n\nAre your connecting strokes attached before or after the letters?\n\n"

      "content": "Looks nice, the general shapes and style of the script.\n\nI think you might let the bottom of the g connect to the next character just like it does with the j. I agree with Jason Pagura that the connection of the b should be on top.  \nThe s is a bit too thin.\n\n"

      "content": "I think the 'h', 'k', 'm', and 'n' don't need the little hooks on their first strokes. Rounding them (like the top of 'u') might look better.\n\nIf you're really worried about the 'b' not connecting, you could try making it look like your 'v' with an ascender.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun and tasty script. I like the direction you're taking with the caps 'A' as well.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

      "content": "Hey chillypepper!\n\nGood work!\n\nThers's go my humble opinion:\n\nI believe that there are some forms that do not get along between them, if one watches the system as a whole.\n\nThe stroke modulations and its relation with a pen are strange in \"A\".  \nThere are thickenings and refinings where it must not have them (c,g,z,x, etc). Counterforms are unbalanced in some letters (f,z).\n\nThe final strokes (that small hook) of (h,k,m,n) I would make them subtler.\n\nAnd finally, it seems to me that the \"x\" and \"z\" deserves a redesign. \"z\" looks like it has a big head and \"x\" seems not to be part of this group.\n\nSorry about my english, hope I has been clear...\n\nBest regards!\n\n"
