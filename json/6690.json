  "content": "Hi typophiles, i've been coming to this forum often for over a year, i enjoy scrubbing through the various topics an reading the interesting stuff that's usually discussed in here. This is going to be my first post; i have to redesign a telephone book for a pocket map and reference guide. In previous editions of this telephone book i've used Bell Centennial, since it's a proven face for such task, and it has worked well for me. Now for the redesign i would like to try something else to obtain a new 'fresher' look.   \nI've been thinking about 'Amplitude' and 'Retina' as possibilities for the redesign. What do you think about those options? Which other fonts do you typophiles think that would suit a telephone book with type around 6pt?   \n   \nThanks in advance for your feedback.\n\n",

Could you please elaborate?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
