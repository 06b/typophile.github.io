It’s no longer in print, but was a mass-market book so it’s easy to find a copy cheap.\n\n"

Looking at other designer work for inspiration is the first part of that process.\n\nThis is true in all the arts. Once you have established a philosophy then inspiration is best sought elsewhere.\n\npbc\n\nAll ideas, theories and statements are subject to change without notice.\n\n"
