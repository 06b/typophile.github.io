(assuming photoshop)\n\n-With the gradient tool.  \nSelect the gradient tool, then click the radial icon on the options bar.\n\n-With a layer style.  \nGo to the \"gradient overlay\" tab and select the radial option.\n\n-With a fill layer.  \nOn the menu bar: Layer \\> New Fill Layer \\> Gradient... \\> Click OK \\> select radial\n\n"

Set your foreground color to white, then just locate where you want the center of the light to be and click once. To get an even more gradual blend, you can use multiple layers, stepping down the size of the brush on each layer while going from light gray to white.\n\n"
