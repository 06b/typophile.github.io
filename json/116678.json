Any help would be super appreciated!\n\nI realize the words on the left and right of \"Growly\" are made up of a simple serif font. It's the word \"Growly\" in the middle that i'm needing to identify.\n\nThanks so much,\n\nKelsey\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140830045120im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Growly_6106.JPG)\n\n",
