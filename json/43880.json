      "content": "Turns out that Bookman (or Bookman Old Face) wasn’t too far off. However, they are all too ’contemporary’ in their interpretations, compared to the sample posted. When looking for old references, I found this old sample to be very close, something called STRATFORD OLD STYLE by Hansen Type Foundry:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022520im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hansen-stratford-oldstyle_6641.jpg)\n\nAnd I found another called ANTIQUE OLD STYLE, credited to the Stevens Shanks foundry in ca. 1860, this time with matching italics:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022520im_/http:/typophile.com/files/antique-old-style_4044.gif)\n\nThere is yet another, Antique No. 310, by the Bruce Type Foundry, which later also released a related face called Bartlett Oldstyle. When Bruce was taken over by ATF, they later released Bartlett Oldstyle as Bookman, which may have served as the blueprint for what is Bookman today.\n\nHowever, the samples I found are still not exact matches (e.g. serif on the numeral 4), but the distinctive lower case ’a’ is there, which I have not found in any other typeface.\n\nWondering if anyone knows of any digital interpretations of fonts called STRATFORD OLD STYLE, ANTIQUE OLD STYLE, ANTIQUE NO. 310, or BARTLETT OLDSTYLE?\n\nAny pointers?\n\n"
