  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am considering purchasing [Freight Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015005313/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php) however I would like to know exactly how editable the typeface is. More specifically, I require the ability to outline the type in order to send it to print. Is this an option when I purchase? (TrueType, OpenType etc.) Or is it up to the foundry to enable/disable this option.\n\nBasically I want to use this typeface at a number of printers, so I would like to use the outline method to embed it into the document, unless you guys know of a better way?\n\nHope you guys can fill me in...\n\nCheers,  \nBen\n\n",

Why not just embed them?\n\nItem f in their EULA seems to allow for this.\n\n\"f. Licensee may embed the fonts in electronic documents provided to Licensee's authorized service bureaus or printers, provided that Licensee ensures that said service bureaus or printers agree to delete or return the electronic documents at the conclusion of rendering services to Licensee.\"\n\n[Removed this sentence because it was stupid.]\n\n"
