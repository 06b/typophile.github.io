  "content": "I’m using the FDK 2.5 to generate some fonts with and I noticed that the OpenType features in these fonts do not work in InDesign CS2 (and CS as well). I’m suspecting that this has to do with the required “languagesystem DFLT dflt;” statement in the new FDK. However, in CS3 and CS4 the features work just fine.\n\nMy features don’t use any language or script tags (the fonts contain latin glyphs only). I’ve also tested what happens when I add ’script DFLT; language dftl;’ to all the features but this is to no avail as well.\n\nDoes anyone have a clue how to make CS2 recognise features with the FDK 2.5 syntax?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n-Paul\n\n",
