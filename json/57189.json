I find that since I am doing it myself, I am overwhelmed by the abundant options for typefaces out there. I am designing the invitation with an nod to art nouveau - I am using an art nouveau-inspired peacock graphic that I have done myself - but I do not necessarily want a literal art nouveau font. Sorry I don't have a picture of the graphic, it's not available on the computer I'm currently on.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
