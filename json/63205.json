(the fonts here are just for presentation).\n\nthis site will be like the homebase of my virtual presence, containing displays of art and design, but also a good place for experimental and creative process publications, and links to my other online resources like flickr, facebook, mail, behance, etc etc.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823135740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/rwetetet2_3962.jpg)\n  \nthis is my logo at the moment (which will also appeare in the site).\n\nmy site will show works by projects in a format which will be a mixture  \nof a blog and a magazine.\n\ni'm looking for a font good sans-serif font for headings, which is clean and legible in smaller sizes (like jpg buttons in a website), but also has some nuance (lyric) calligraphic qualities. in a way, this font needs to bridge between minimalism and my works which are often characterised by calligraphy or typography.\n\nthe closest matches i found were italic/slanted solutions like linotype's optima nova (which is very expensive btw).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823135740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/heading%20font%20src_3739.jpg)\n\n",
