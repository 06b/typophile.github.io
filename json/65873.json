  "content": "I'm doing a slight redesign for a magazine which currently uses Barmeno as it's main font. The editor wants to keep this as he thinks it gives the title a modern, friendly look. Any suggestions for serif fonts I can pair with Barmeno? I was thinking of using barmeno for heading and the serif for the text... I am a bit of a beginner when it comes to typography! There is no budget to buy new fonts so I would be using ones supplied with the Adobe suite. Thanks for any suggestions!\n\n",
