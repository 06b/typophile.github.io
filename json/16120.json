See the image in my [Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20120103165912/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html), which was taken from the old Phil's Photo book.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I'll zapp Jamies site designers and see if they'll cough up details, before I drop the £... $... €... and a couple of hours in Illustrator. heh.\n\nG\n\n"
