  "content": "Hello,   \n   \nI know this isn't directly type related but I am looking for a good blank T-shirt company that carries all of the colors in the rainbow in infant sizes. I have looked all over the place and all I can find are cheesy pastels. I am looking for some good rich bold colors. Anyone have an idea? Please contact me : [jeff@jeeto.com](mailto:jeff@jeeto.com).   \n   \nIf I am able to work with a recommendation you have I will send you a canvas hot off the press from our company : [http://www.jeeto.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019111341/http:/www.jeeto.com/). Ill sign it myself and make you all happy and stuff.   \n   \nThanks in advance!\n\n",

Broder brothers is cool and I dig the colors they have but still need a variety like orange and green. Maybe the best thing to do is get a dyer for the aa whites... keep em coming if you have something. Thanks!\n\n"
