I get the impression that it generates tabular oldstyle figures, fake titling letters and figures, fake smallcaps, and the appropriate scripts, and that I can go adjust all of the outlines to make it work right.

They are certainly not all \"production ready\", and haven't been updated in a while. I'm pretty sure the one you're referring to generates bad glyph names which would need to be fixed.\n\nAdam\n\n"
