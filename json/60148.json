  "content": "Hello,\n\nA friend has asked me to help design a small workbook for her. This workbook will be around 30 pages, contain line art illustrations, be printed in black and white, and will be designed for her kids, which are young adults with mild learning disabilities. She has chosen the typeface FF Meta for the copy of the workbook and is unsure about what typeface to use for the titles of each chapter section (headlines).\n\nShe is really set on using FF Meta, and we are trying to decide what would be a suitable typeface, if any, serif or sans-serif, that compliments Meta well while retaining organization and legibility.\n\n",
