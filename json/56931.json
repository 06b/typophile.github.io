Google \"vector MS Word\" for more on the subject!\n\nYou might want to consider creating a standalone pdf with empty text fields to be filled in by your client. It can be done quite easily in Acrobat Pro, but you have to stick to fonts installed on the clients computer (if I remember correctly).\n\n"

If Enhanced Metafile isn't an option, choose Picture (Windows Metafile). If both are available, EMF is better.\n\nIf you want to save the logo in .wmf or .emf format, there are any number of programs that will extract those formats from the clipboard.\n\n"
