They still kept selling Microgramma, as far as I know. More type families in the catalog can often lead to more sales.\n\n_\\>Do font names change when cyrillic characters are added?_\n\nNo. Sometimes, the name might be appended with a “Pro” or “Plus” or “Super” or “Awesome” or “Whatever” though.\n\n"

It is said: _The typeface was designed at TypeMarket in 1992-1993 by Alexey Kustov. Similar to Eurostile by Aldo Novarese, 1962, Nebiolo._ [note: The character set is just cyrillic standard].\n\n"
