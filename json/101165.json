  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm working on a book project that involves images from the 1890s/early 1900s like the attached. I'm looking for a serif typeface (either from that period or another) to use as body text and haven't found anything I love yet.\n\nAny recommendations?\n\nThanks very much!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819183741im_/http:/typophile.com/files/moerlein_labels_3590.jpg)\n\n",
