      "content": "I'd guess it's custom by the sculptor. If it's molded in concrete, there could have been a standard set of dies made up for the letters and numerals, but my guess is that each one would have been hand-carved from what appears to be sandstone.\n\n- Lex\n\nEDIT: Didn't read that it was concrete. I stand by my die hypothesis.\n\n"

      "content": "I think Lex's idea makes a lot of sense, although it also seems possible that the dies he suggested were based on an existing typeface. I notice the '7' is quite odd -- more like an upside-down 'L'. I can't think of a typeface with that feature. This date was 1947. Are all the bridges of a similar age, and were the plaques made when the bridges were built, or added on later?\n\nWould you have any more samples of the lettering? For my purposes only the R and E in this sample are useful as key letters. I'd like to know what the C, G, J, K, M, U or W look like to have more to base an ID on.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

That font was designed in 1985, but who knows if it was based on anything older. [Note: you need to use the site's 'TRY' feature to see the range of weights for the font.]\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
