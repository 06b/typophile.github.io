  "content": "I am new to the world of typography. I am just trying to create something personal. I want to create a hand mirror out of a script lower case \"b\" but I am having some trouble getting the word to be legible. The word is \"behold\" and originally I was going to do a mirror for each loop in the \"b\", \"h\", and \"l\". But I am now at the point where I am would be happy with just the \"b\"! Has anyone ever seen anything like this? Or could give me some pointers. I don't know if I am looking for inspiration or encouragement....or if this is even the right place for my question since I have only been working on this for a few days! Sorry if I am not in the right place, but thanks to anyone who could help me!\n\n",
