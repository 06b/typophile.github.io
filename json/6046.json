  "content": "Matthew Carter and Charles Creesy to present on Monticello at The Grolier Club in New York.   \n   \nBUFFALO, NY, JANUARY 11, 2003 - In an event of interest to type lovers and history buffs alike, [Matthew Carter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142614/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/carter/matthew/) and Charles Creesy will present \"The New Digital Monticello Type: History and Inspirations.\" Co-sponsored by the [American Printing History Association](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142614/http:/www.printinghistory.org/) (APHA), [The Society of Typographic Aficionados](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142614/http:/www.typesociety.org/) (SOTA), and the [Type Directors Club](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142614/http:/www.tdc.org/) (TDC), this presentation will be held Tuesday, February 25, 2003, 6 p.m., at New York's [Grolier Club](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142614/http:/www.grolierclub.org/).   \n   \nThe Monticello typeface claims a lineage reaching back to Thomas Jefferson and America's first type foundry, Binny & Ronaldson. Because the former American president admired the types of Binny & Ronaldson, Monticello was named in honor of Jefferson's home. Originally commissioned by [Princeton University Press](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142614/http:/pup.princeton.edu/) for the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Monticello represented the desire of editor Julian Boyd and the Press to present modern documentary editing in historically allusive typography.   \n   \nThe Press's Creesy will talk about Binny & Ronaldson, their relations with Thomas Jefferson, and how their 1797 type inspired the 1950 Linotype face Monticello. Carter will expound on this history, discussing his twenty-first century digital version of this quintessentially American typeface.   \n   \nCarter, a type designer with more than forty years' experience with typographic technologies ranging from hand-cut punches to computer fonts, has designed a number of significant typefaces, including ITC Galliard, Bell Centennial (for U.S. telephone directories), Mantinia, Big Caslon, Miller, and the screen fonts Verdana and Georgia. Carter is a principal of Carter & Cone Type, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts.   \n   \nCreesy, Director of Computing and Publishing Technologies at the Press, was honored by the Association of American University Presses in 1996 for his efforts to help publishers adopt digital technologies. His article about the creation of the original Linotype Monticello and the new revival by Carter will appear in the Princeton University Library Chronicle.   \n   \nThis presentation is part of the APHA \"On the Road\" series of events held across the United States in 2002-2003. The event is free and open to the public. Reservations are not required, but seating in the intimate facility is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Event attendees will receive a keepsake, the first showing of Carter's Monticello, courtesy of the Press.   \n   \nFurther details are available in a [PDF downloadable](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142614/http:/www.typesociety.org/events/SOTA_APHA_Monticello.pdf) from the SOTA website, or by contacting Mark Samuels Lasner, Vice-President for Programs, APHA, P.O.
