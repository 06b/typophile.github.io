  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nIn 2006 (I believe), I downloaded this font from a free site and used it as my bands font. I've looked over the free sites through what seem to be the obvious categories... I've also been to the font identifier sites and am getting nothing. If I see the name, I'd probably remember it...\n\nThanks\n\np.s. The files I'm uploading are from the website... The gradient, drop shadow, and outline have all been added and are not the original font.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bios1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620212545/http:/typophile.com/files/bios1.gif) | 26.81 KB |\n| [merch1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620212545/http:/typophile.com/files/merch1.gif) | 20.14 KB |\n\n",
