  "content": "Hi everyone,  \nI left my job about six months ago and started freelancing. I’ve now decided it’s time to take things a bit more seriously and design a business card for myself.\n\nSo far I’ve got four options, they’re not too different from one another but I’d like to get some feedback on the layouts.\n\nI’ve left them B&W for the moment until I reach a decision on what colour(s) I’m after. I plan on getting them printed on a matt stock using an offset printer.\n\ncheers.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [final\\_4.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104155/http:/typophile.com/files/final_4.pdf) | 235.74 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "If art director / designer is a description of what you do vs. a formal title, it should absolutely not be capitalized.\n\nPersonally, I find this sort of indiscriminate capitalization a huge problem, especially in advertising. Why are graphic designers not required to take basic courses in grammar, structure and spelling? The people responsible for the text we read should also have training that is a bit broader than aesthetics and tool-use.\n\nCertainly, I have never asked if there was “a Doctor in the house,” but I would address my friend James as Doctor Liau. Capitalize a title or honorific, sure … but not a description; that doesn’t make any sense at all.\n\n—-\n\njlt : [http://www.hewnandhammered.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104155/http:/www.hewnandhammered.com/) : rnrmf!\n\n"

If it was a description I probably would haved worded it Art direction/design.\n\nOn another note, most Art Directors work with Copywriters and generally they take care of all the grammar, structure and spelling.\n\n————  \n [A different kind of fun.](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104155/http:/www.bezarama.net/)\n\n"
