Has anyone else been peeved by this or found a solution? I take it the SC would need to be their own file?\n\nFlash needs to get with the program, this is lame.\n\nOn a side note Im looking for a serif companion to National, if you are familiar to the face Im open to suggestions.\n\nThanks,  \ng\n\n",
