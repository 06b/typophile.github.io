In order so that any advice won’t be based on a labels and preconceptions. But I can say, the target audience is pretty much everyone.\n\n"

It will probably seem even pricier, but all 7 weights, both Roman and Italic, have small caps, CE language support, superior and inferior figs, numerators and denominators, Lining and Oldstyle figs both tabular and proportional, even monetary symbols to match the OSFs. Plus the OT features to support all these extra glyphs.\n\nI’ve been caught here saying “soon” about Mundo Pro, but it really is finished, produced and just waiting to be released.\n\nNot to hype it too much, but Mundo was designed for wide general use; it is readable and clear in small sizes, and in fact the bolder weights were based on handpainted signage. Useful at any size (with appropriate tracking of course) and available in 7 weights.\n\n"
