  "content": "Last Thursday I got confirmation that my proposals for a fashion webretailer were accepted and a budget cleared — so it appears that I am back in business: my first client!\n\nAfter two years of (professional) inactivity it’s a strange feeling to be back in the loop again. But also exciting — I get to do what I enjoy.\n\nThis gig is going to be an ongoing project, with 6 or 7 items to be produced every month. All of them in digital form. For the moment I am going to use Process Type’s **Locator** as the main typeface. I bought that to use in my own (very limited) identity, but it’s very fitting for upscale woman’s fashion, I think. But I am still on the lookout for a sans with an open character and — very important! — a thin and very thin Light style.\n\nI will probably post some stuff here in a month or two.\n\n",
