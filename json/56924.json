It looks to be designed by Funny Garbage and Ryan Feerer. It also says that the background art and illustrations were taken from Gustave Dore’s illustrated version of Paradise Lost. Dore’s illustrations are detailed engravings, so my guess is that all of the engraving textures are taken from that.\n\nVery lovely cover, in my opinion.\n\n"
