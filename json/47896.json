  "content": "Apologies if this is the wrong thread, I am happy for it to moved if it is in the wrong area.\n\nBasically, I am embarking on a logo design for a client, at this stage I am just sketching some ideas.\n\nCurrently I have this:\n\n[http://lw-d.co.uk/concept.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023075652/http:/lw-d.co.uk/concept.gif \"http://lw-d.co.uk/concept.gif\")\n\nJust a rough sketch, the clients names consists of the letters c and f, I wanted to try and tie in the two letters as a symbol, with the logo-type to the right (signified by the three lines.\n\nNow, I know this is a very rough sketch, but I was wondering if anyone can recommended any fonts that would get me started with the logotype, I am considering illustrating the c and f, but think that an existing font would be easier, and, with complexitites of typography.... better formed.\n\nSo, to conclude this lenghty post, can anyone recommend any fonts that would set up a nice c and f logotype, the added benefit of using an exsiting font is that I can compliment the font with the full company name on the right.\n\nAppreciate any help.\n\nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "I think you should try draw this form by hand and make it truly your own. There's great potential in your initial sketch. However there's no harm looking some other typefaces. I'm a big fan of the work of Argentine typographer [Alejandro Paul](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023075652/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/paul/alejandro/) of [Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023075652/http:/www.sudtipos.com/). He does some excellent calligraphic faces from which you could probably take some inspiration. Have a look at [Affair](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023075652/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000181) or maybe something a bit more tame like [Chocolate](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023075652/http:/www.sudtipos.com/fonts/3). Go n-éirí leat.\n\n"
