Proportional figures also typically incorporate [kerning](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501052750/http:/typophile.com/wiki/kerning) so that they space evenly. This figure scheme is better suited for text whereas [tabular figures](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501052750/http:/typophile.com/wiki/tabular%20figures) (those that share a common width) are better suited for setting figures in columns.\n\n**Additional Articles**  \n [The FontFeed: Figuring It Out: OSF, LF, and TF Explained](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501052750/http:/fontfeed.com/archives/figuring-it-out-osf-lf-and-tf-explained/)\n\n",
