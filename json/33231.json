That sucked. On the other hand the smaller the point size the larger the x-height should be - and newspapers are a very prominent and long-standing case of small-size typography needing large x-heights.\n\nGreta’s x-height I would actually not call “obese” btw - I think if you measure it it’ll come out to about what Times is. Also, width has a compounding effect; Times is narrow while ITC Garamond is wide, making the latter than much worse.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, caps constituting only about 5% of text aren’t very relevant here. But Greta’s sure are super short! Some kind of record\\*, or close. I personally like that, although it does have one drawback: for text that’s likely to be <cite>scanned</cite> (as a rule for a proper name, hence something capitalized) it’s less effective than caps that stand out a bit. And it seems to me that the types of settings that benefit from fonts with large x-heights also tend to benefit from being easily scanned.\n\n\\* Vectora’s caps are even smaller, but look at the x-height compared to the ascenders: gargantuan. I’d say this makes the caps relatively larger than Greta’s.\n\nhhp\n\n"
