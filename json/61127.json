No doubt, that a font like DTL Fleischmann is excellent, but in my opinion fonts like Feliciano’s Merlo or Santos’ Capsa or Kobayashi’s Clifford are on a comparable quality level, if not on the same one. However, you are obviously successful with your calculations.\n\nI am primary interested in a decompiler/compiler, that comments the XML tags and that checks the consistency. And it should be possible to personalize both, the consistency check and the comments. The naming system, that Adobe uses, violates the OT specification, but it works. So the consistency check reports errors, as far as I remember. In this context I would like to know, how fast you can update the OTMaster, when Adobe updates the AFDKO and how much updates/upgrades of the OTMaster will cost.\n\nI would be interested in a light version (not the test version) without the glyph editor. I assume, that it would be easy to remove it. Can you imagine to provide such a version for less money?\n\n"

No doubt, that a font like DTL Fleischmann is excellent, but [...]_  \n&nbsp;  \nLooking at the man years put into the production of DTL Fleischmann, the pricing of the fonts is realistic. After an intensive study a large range of photographs were taken (ordered) of historical Fleischmann material and enlargements were made. Subsequently new drawings of **all** characters were made by hand. These were enlarged and served as the basis for the working drawings, which were all marked and manually digitized in the IKARUS format. The generated Bezier data was checked against the IK data for conversion errors and all contours were ‘cleaned’, i.e., unnecessary contour points were removed.  \nThis production method was chosen to preserve the most tiny details in the design and it paid out when one looks at the quality of the final digital results.  \n&nbsp;\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_1_3990.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_2_5119.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_3_3863.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_4_3948.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_5_3432.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_6_5940.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_7_6108.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_8_4866.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203205403im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fleischm_prod_9_4551.jpg)\n  \n&nbsp;  \n_The naming system, that Adobe uses, violates the OT specification, but it works.

More than twenty years ago I set up a font (production) program for DTL, which expresses my personal ideas about type and typography, and in which both high quality historical and newly to design typefaces got a place. The historical typefaces had and have to cover the different style periods and all typefaces should not overlap but support each other. This means for instance that the different contrast sorts and contrast variants are covered. Normally type designers are invited to make a certain typeface that fits the program, like Erhard Kaiser was in 1992 for DTL Fleischmann.\n\nThe complete DTL library will contain not more than roughly 25 typefaces at the end and each typeface will at least support Cyrillic and Greek besides Latin then.\n\n"
