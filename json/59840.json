I like the proportions and drawing quite a bit.\n\nHigh i tittle seems out of place with such short ascenders.\n\nt seems a little weak above the crossbar.\n\nYou might narrow (pull in the diagonal side) a bit on the top left of r/m/n and bottom right of u a touch.\n\n"

      "content": "I´ve messed around with it quite a bit, changed some proportions, like in the uppercase S, tried to flesh out as many characters as I could (many looking pretty horrible at the moment, you will see).\n\nDo check the new PDF (Board 2) on the first post.\n\nOne big question I have, regarding the design of the letter s. How do you people go about the spine of it, how exactly does the 2 nodes (sometimes 4) happen in there? So far I don´t have them at all, but notice it in every respectable typeface I can remember.\n\nThanks!  \nRodrigo\n\n"
