Here is [East Bloc Closed](http://web.archive.org/web/20121130041520/http:/www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/MI415591). There is an alternate version and two equivalent lined versions.\n\n[edit: hmmm, I guess they are getting them from Monotype, which also has this font. For some reason I thought Monotype had offloaded the Image Club fonts after having them for a while. Apparently they just decided they didn't need to be the exclusive vendors.]\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
