The distinguishing characteristics of the sans letter, lacking serifs and usually being more or less monolineal, seem more striking than those of the serifed letter. How the letter is drawn, its basic shape, comes to the fore in the absence of concerns about serif shapes & directions, and stroke width. So what about lowercase sans g's. I love the eyeglass style (Gill) and don't like the Frutiger//Futura-style. Does anyone else care?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031821im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gs.gif)\n\n",

In context binocular g is disturbing, or would be if they weren't a widely accepted convention.\n\nAnd too, a lot of type designers make a cutesy binocular g for their text roman and end up with something that ruins an otherwise well-balanced font.

The bowl is one of the spectacle lenses and the angled piece is the nose in profile. 2) A human figure.

You can read up on that [by clicking here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031821/http:/www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/ezhyogh.html).\n\nInterestingly, the bicameral 'g' had at one point entirely stamped out the unicameral 'g'. The latter wasn't revived until the development of the first modern typefaces- when typographers began looking for ways to simplify letters, the bifocal 'g' was an obvious target.\n\nIt's interesting to see how many variants the 'g' has, and that so many of them are recognizable instantly as the same letter, without question. It demonstrates how language can still change in times of globalization and grand cultural diffusion.\n\nI personally perceive at the bipartisan 'g' as a written form, even when it's present in a modern font.

Probably a good idea since many people perhaps like to use standard shapes.\n\nHowever, as we placed the alternate g's in the font - people can chose whatever shape they want, and combine them. It's quite nice when you print words with two following g, like \"begging\", \"dragging\" or something, and chose to use two different versions :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031821im_/http:/typophile.com/files/neptuna2_gggg.jpg)\n\n"

The full binocular form is a stand-out. Yet, even tho it is true they go against the essence of antiqua lower case, they are widespread in text romans, and integrated readily enuff by the brain/mind. What designers won't integrate the brain will. Or maybe it's really a mind trick :^)\n\nThe ideal g solution is, I think, the Schwabacher form.

Not just the horn but the stressing thruout the rest of it---is it an example of Bloemsma-inspired ordered irregularity? The horn, looking like Tin Tin's shock of yellow hair, makes the whole thing anthropomorphic.

There's reason to believe that -especially when it's doubled- the closed-bottom binocular \"g\" can cause a -minor- reading hiccup.
