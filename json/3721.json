  "content": "Hi,   \n   \nI’m a graphic design student at ECIAD in Vancouver spending a semester here at RISD in Providence, and one of my classes is a typeface design class. It’s taught by Cyrus Highsmith of Font Bureau.   \n   \nI stumbled upon this forum and was impressed by the wealth of knowledge and number of people I recognized (Keith Tam teaches at my school, and I met J.F. Porchez. at last year’s ATypI in Vancouver). I figured this was the right place to ask for some advice!   \n   \nMy project and first typeface is a blend of sans-serif and blackletter. It’s been tough going so far, but the general idea is to reclaim and simplify blackletter in a way that doesn’t bring along negative connotations, and to add to the sans-serif some of the interesting features of blackletter type that add character and some might say legibility. To do this, I’ve been trying to both add blackletter features to sans-serif structures as well as to simplify and modernize the blackletter. At the moment, I’m somewhere in the muddy in-between…   \n   \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, especially in terms of general direction or good blackletter typefaces to analyze or base this on. So far, Gotenburg B Bold, Deutsch Gotische, and Werbdeutsch Heavy have all seemed promising.   \n   \nI don't really want it to be a display type like Orbon, but my limited experience may require it to be so. ;)   \n   \nThanks very much for your time!\n\n",

I was watching a Blackletter calligraphy demonstration by Ward Dunham, and the idea for the design evolved from there.   \n   \n [http://www.terminaldesign.com/retail.php?ID=3](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074924/http:/www.terminaldesign.com/retail.php?ID=3)\n\n"

Complexity is human and beautiful, and in this case it's what makes blackletter better than roman for readability:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_fraktur1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074924/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_fraktur1.html)   \n   \nWhat I would do is, yes, avoid the decorative aspect of blackletter, but only in terms of finish. In terms of _structure_ (especially in the ascenders and descenders) I would leverage blackletter's wonderful divergence.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
