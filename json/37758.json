Boldoni takes to the egde its width and serifs, causing a ultrafat type feeling, and its styles causes a monochromatic effect that remember the colors Black, Gray and White. Some of uses are titles, initials, drop caps, lettering, posters and vertical writing.\n\nYou can see it on pdf attached and T26 site,\n\n[http://www.t26.com/fonts/Boldoni](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015001941/http:/www.t26.com/fonts/Boldoni)\n\nComments are welcome!\n\nJarbas Gomes  \n [ForteType.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015001941/http:/www.fortetype.com/)  \n--\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [boldoni-family.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015001941/http:/typophile.com/files/boldoni-family.pdf) | 254.36 KB |\n\n",
