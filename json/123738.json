      "content": "I do hope people note Akira's comment about OPTI.  \nFor anyone who has not seen any of my posts about OPTI, here is the essential problem.  \nOPTI/Castcraft has a notorious reputation of as a forger of unauthorized clones of digital fonts.  \nA relatively small proportion of its fonts were original digital creations.  \nUnfortunately, even the original digital fonts by OPTI are probably unusable for publication. OPTI is a defunct organization and these fonts are orphans for which there is no way of obtaining appropriate intellectual property permissions.  \nIf a poster considers that there never was a digital version other than the one created by OPTI, then any discussion of this font should make clear that the font is in effect unusable.  \nThis problem comes up fairly often. See for example the discussion in [http://typophile.com/node/122803](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415100243/http:/typophile.com/node/122803 \"http://typophile.com/node/122803\")  \nDon\n\n"
