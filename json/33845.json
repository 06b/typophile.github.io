      "content": "Well, I have been studying 'HenryFour' and the majority of the Roman letters are from Adobe Garamond, in my opinion, or are at least similar enough that I personally can't see an obvious difference (I know my eyes aren't as calibrated as some of yours). The 'd' and 'u' have distinctively low baseline serifs, and the 'k' seems identical. The letters which are NOT Adobe Garamond are (I think) the 'a', 'c', 'g', 'j', 's', 'C', 'G', 'P', 'S', 'T', and maybe the 'J'.\n\nWhere do those other letters come from? I think the 'g' looks most like Janson, but some of the other letters look like a Caslon Oldstyle. I think at least some of the italic letters, such as the 'g' look also like Caslon.\n\nMy feeling is still that HenryFour is a 'Frankenstein's Monster' with borrowed parts, and possibly no original design.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
