  "content": "Hello all my name is Erica i just wanted to post some thoughts of mine on here, im starting out in this world of type so i dont know to much but i have had alot of thoughts. please feel feel to comment thats why were here :)\n\nI have always been a creator of sorts and went to many different font sites to check out the latest designs, though it upset me i never could get the “free” font to download, i could always look at them. i didnt really have to much use for them then because i didnt do that kind of creating. but now as i have started my way into the graphic design world i find that right now i am using text alot and new and different fonts could come in handy. right now im just using the regular apple fonts that came with my MAC (which im falling in love with) but i think i would like to venture outward and take advantage of these designer fonts. but i have come to a question, when i am designing mock logos for any of my design classes are these internet fonts ok to use? is that a normal thing to do? when i go to make a real logo for a company one day will it be ok to use one of these internet designer fonts for a company, or must you come up with your own? im not sure how all that works.\n\nand mostly it fasinates me how someone can design an entire alphabet of designer fonts that do not look anything like another, where do you get your ideas???\n\nas i have scaned through just about every forum topic on this web page i can see how far advanced most of the people here are, and makes me feel that there is a ton more to learn and that there is alot more involved with designing things that i do not see yet. the longest read was about  \n“hidefweb solutions” this person had 6 pages of series of logos for this one company each page of design was different from the next but the content of each page individually were variations of the style being portrayed. and the company said that non of them hit to home, they wanted a text based logo, not so much an image because they were expanding. well there were some really good varieties of designes going on there, but to fathum that the company could not pick one?? hmmmmm i must be missing something. it must be my untrained eyes. what am i missing\n\nlast this one will stray off topic, have you ever seen the movie “HERO” wow good stuff well in there they explain the relationship of how thier ancient scrips (the writting they do with a large brush and paper) goes hand in hand with sword fighting, now how beautiful is that? i want to learn how to sword fight. just check out the movie :)\n\nnow most of you might beable to reference which discussions i speek of here in the forums, because yall get around, this place is pretty awsome, i should hope to beable to submit worthwile comments in the future. :) good luck everyone have a good night\n\nERICA\n\n [‹ Hiragino Mincho Pro - PC version?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314123239/http:/typophile.com/node/14564 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Difference between cuts of Clarendon (BT, MT, Linotype/Adobe)??? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314123239/http:/typophile.com/node/14458 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Many logos are based on modified versions of already existing fonts and then there are many hand drawn logos too.\n\nIt is up to you to decide if a font face is appropriate for a work or a new lettering needs to be done.\n\nA dirty little secret: I made my own logo from scanned letters of DTL Nobel (a font I didn’t wanted to buy).\n\nHéctor\n\n"

      "content": "Erica, welcome! Yes, it’s not “usual” to design a complete font... But it’s a unique challenge with special rewards, and you seem to already have an important ingredient: you think it’s fascinating!\n\nUsing a free/cheap font for a logo: that’s actually safer than using such fonts for text! Because you have a chance to look closely at the beziers and fix stuff as needed; for text a font has to be adequate out of the box. To be fair though, not all free/cheap fonts suck. And some reputable foundries even give out quality free fonts, sort of as bait.\n\nBTW, I’ve always wanted to learn swordfighting. There are different styles I guess; to me the stuff at the Olympics is least interesting, because it has neither romanticism nor spirit; I prefer what might be called “Conan-style”, but most of all I would love to learn to properly use a wakizashi. The katana seems too... loud. I actually have a Japanese sword set (although it’s stored half a world away now) but the most action it’s seen was against a side of ham.\n\nOne parallel between swordfighting and making type I guess is the level of concentration required: putting your life on the line and making a good quality font cannot be done casually (even though few type designers rely on type to make a living).\n\nhhp\n\n"

Traditional Yang Family style Tai Chi (Taiji) is like wathcing paint peel, and the more advanced you are, the less movements are visible (all internal).\n\nBTW — my niece, [Jessica](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314123239/http:/nusports.collegesports.com/sports/w-fenc/mtt/florendo_jessica00.html), is a foil champion and is very exciting to watch.
