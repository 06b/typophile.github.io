As a substitute I would use BiffBamBoom by Comicraft [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/biff-bam-boom/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141006194437/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/biff-bam-boom/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/biff-bam-boom/\") The lettering is very successful because it expresses the vigor shown in BiffBamBoom within the frame work of a less staccato treatment of the tops and bottoms of letters.
