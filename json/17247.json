Also, it will open variants of those formats, such as dfont and OpenType.\n\nOther software’s native format files are not supported: Fontographer’s fog format cannot be parsed by FontLab Studio 5, but FontLab’s “FogLamp” utility can convert fogs.\n\nPerhaps Yuri or Adam is around and can post a better-informed answer.\n\n"
