As part of my TA duties, I had five to ten minutes of each class to talk about whatever type-related thing I wanted to talk about. I wrote a blog post about these mini-lectures, and I'd love to hear what y'all think. I'm sure there are things that some of our more curmudgeonly members can pick apart.\n\n[http://edoctor.tumblr.com/post/83022679290/doctor-overanalyzes-typograph...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140254/http:/edoctor.tumblr.com/post/83022679290/doctor-overanalyzes-typography-ii \"http://edoctor.tumblr.com/post/83022679290/doctor-overanalyzes-typography-ii\")\n\n",
