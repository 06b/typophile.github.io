I want to improve on the typeface, so looking around I found Neosans/Neotech ( [http://www.monotypefonts.com/WhatsNew/Releases.asp?show=neo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108031237/http:/www.monotypefonts.com/WhatsNew/Releases.asp?show=neo \"http://www.monotypefonts.com/WhatsNew/Releases.asp?show=neo\") ) which I love but the price doesn’t love me so does anyone know of any other typefaces similar to Neosans that are more affordable\n\n [‹ Masthead Help](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108031237/http:/typophile.com/node/18467 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Garamond & Condensed sans ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108031237/http:/typophile.com/node/18440 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

(This is not a hard and fast rule, but it tends to be true most of the time.)\n\nIf you only purchase the weights you need, Neo might be exactly what you’re craving.\n\nAnyhow... I’m sure that someone who is better-acquainted with all of the new releases from all foundries will be along in a short while to provide some alternatives for you.\n\n"
