Most are bookmarked at home, but here are a few right now:\n\nContemporary posters divided into categories: [AllPosters.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090409084508/http:/www.allposters.com/)  \nA great resource on [Advertising in America 1850-1920](http://web.archive.org/web/20090409084508/http:/scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/eaa/)  \nNo posters, but great for vintage ads in magazines [Ad\\*Access](http://web.archive.org/web/20090409084508/http:/scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/adaccess/)\n\nIf you browse through some of the galleries presented on LetterheadFonts.com, you can see contermporary designs using “antique-styled” typefaces.  \n- [Main Gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20090409084508/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/gallery/)  \n- [Portfolio 5](http://web.archive.org/web/20090409084508/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=8)\n\n"

My guess would be that design schools, probably European ones like the Netherlands, would be the most likely resource. I will look at my bookmarks when I get home.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Particularly note timeline samples from 60s — 90s.  \n [Design for Print & Digital Media](http://web.archive.org/web/20090409084508/http:/users.design.ucla.edu/~cariesta/designhistory/) by Silvia Rigon\n\nYet another link — not sure if you are plugged-in to the [Teaching Designers Network](http://web.archive.org/web/20090409084508/http:/tdn.freie-hochschule-freiburg.de/tdn.php), an international group of teaching designer which you can join.\n\nHope this helps. Also, I would be very interested in viewing any samples of your students’ projects.\n\n"
