He makes some nice Slabs!\n\nI really like the extra bold version of FF Zine, but it really lacks a light version, and I think the regular feels too condensed. However, for this project I might just buy the extra bold or black version of FF Zine.\n\nI'm figuring that that's a lot cheaper than buying Poplar.\n\n"

I love that aesthetic myself.\n\n"
