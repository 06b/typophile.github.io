Any suggestions?\n\nIt would be great if the font works well with Variable ( [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/variable/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110509085843/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/variable/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/variable/\")) but I am also open to sugggestions of other fonts that work well with Variable.\n\nThanks.  \n-Will\n\n",

How closely do you want the fonts to work, because Variable is fairly fine and most serifs will be too heavy to combine in body copy with Variable Regular or Bold.  \nTim\n\n"

      "time": "",
      "content": "\"But itâ€™s too 70s.\" Exactly.  \nIf you really want flares with that, you might consider a couple of the old ITC faces - [ITC Novarese](http://web.archive.org/web/20110509085843/http:/www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sku=ITC9157) or [ITC Newtext](http://web.archive.org/web/20110509085843/http:/www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=VCCLSFKKHEKF8JR0GWD408PSKVFU89H4&sku=ITC9136) are both flared this way, but neither is unique, and the geometry of Variable makes this pairing a bit problematic to harmonise. Alternatively, if the types are not being used in close proximity on the page, you could go for a complete structural contrast in the headlines, captions etc. and try the grandaddy of flare serif types - Berthold Wolpe's [Albertus](http://web.archive.org/web/20110509085843/http:/itc.identifont.co.uk/partner?VCCLSFKKHEKF8JR0GWD408PSKVFU89H4+Albertus+255290+010082113), which is also available in an italic and a light weight these days.  \nHaving said all that, I much prefer Tim's idea of contrasting Variable with an Egyptian or Slabserif.\n\n"

      "content": "You need a serif typeface that isn't mousy and won't bow to the pressure of being paired with such a overtly modern typeface. Something quirky on its own, I think. What about something from [Fountain](http://web.archive.org/web/20110509085843/http:/www.fountain.nu/) such as Stefan Hattenbach's [Delicato](http://web.archive.org/web/20110509085843/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/delicato.asp)?\n\nSo the faces won't be used on the same page? OR The serif will be text and the sans will be head and sub-head?\n\nI think you will be updating regularly if you choose to use such a modern typeface as trends change so quickly. I suppose this can be seen as a positive as the art world changes its mind as to what is vogue from week to week as well.\n\n"
