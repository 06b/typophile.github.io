A feature I have not seen before.\n\nI’m fairly confidant it’s there to assist users with reading differences. Akin to how you used to use a ruler to help you read when you were learning.\n\nIt’s still novel to me, but I think I like it. Then again, my vision isn’t that good, and I like big, easy to read type.\n\nDoes anyone:  \na) know how this feature technically implemented? (css, html 5, Flash &c)  \nb) have any thoughts or feelings about it?\n\n",

I have yet\\* to come across anything published.\n\nDiemand-Yauman, C., Oppenheimer, D. M. & Vaughan, E. B. (2010). Fortune favours the bold (and the italicized): Effects of disfluency on educational outcomes. _Cognition, 118(1)_, 111–115.\n\nBut this sample population for Diemand-Yauman et al. (1020) were not readers with learning differences. Experiment 2 did have 222 subjects (Ss) however, so it’s possible there were a few Ss in there who did have learning differences but fell within their inclusion criteria of academic performance, or did not report any learning differences.\n\nI look forward to your response!\n\n\\* Please excuse my crap seizure-medicated memory. I may have in fact read something and don’t recall.  \n [http://readthetype.com/literature/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130525155304/http:/readthetype.com/literature/ \"http://readthetype.com/literature/\")\n\n"

The highlighted paragraph is the current paragraph you are reading, and you can use the bar for the line. It's a similar concept to using an index card or bookmark for reading line by line.\n\n[http://beelinereader.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130525155304/http:/beelinereader.com/ \"http://beelinereader.com\") accomplishes something similar using text gradients, which I also use personally.\n\nObviously, there is personal experience in the mix too: I experimented quite a bit with colors and reading in college, but never mentioned anything openly about it until I realized others had similar issues and methods for dealing with them.\n\n"
