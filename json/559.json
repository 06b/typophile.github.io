Your comments and work is a great inspiration to me.   \nThis here is my first font. I mainly made it to to get experienced with the software, thus the utter simplicity of it.. it's been lurking around my hard drive for quite some time now, so I think it's about time I finish it ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110805im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \nAny comments as to what I should do better?   \n   \nThank you,   \nMads Rahbek Hougaard\n\n",

It definetly needs \"humanizing\"!   \nStill, doing that would probably make it necessary to change a whole lot (if not everything), which I'm not really up to...   \nThe \"dead\" nature of this font might be because I was very (perhaps too) systematic about it. Building the letters out of small bricks. Next time I'll try a different approach.   \n   \n\\>The K's does seem a bit odd though.   \n   \nJoe Pemberton:   \n\\>I think the K is nice. Perhaps an alternate is in order.   \n   \nOdd? Nice? In what way? ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110805im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) I thought they were pretty straight-forward..   \n   \n ![anton_kk.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110805im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1288.gif)  \n   \nHere's a pic of the old k's - but I don't really like them. I think this K resembles the X too much. Also, I was thinking the new k's would probably be more readable in context with the other letters, because they are more unique? But perhaps they're too unique?   \n   \n\\>I think that q could, out of context be mistaken for a g...   \n   \nI've heard that before, so it's probably true. But I must admit I'm quite fond of it as it is, so I think I'll take my chances ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110805im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nJonathan Hise Kaldma:   \n\\>The 'Q' however seems too much like your 'q'.

Maybe open up the lower counter.   \n   \nI was hoping nobody would notice that! I have earlier tried to do something about it, but I thought the results didn't work out that well. I just made two new versions though, which aren't just as bad. Or, one of them isn't. I think. Here they are:   \n   \n ![anton_gg.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110805im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1289.gif)  \n   \nI sort of like the black one. But maybe the space in the middle (excuse my complete lack of english typographic words!) is still too small?   \n   \nThank you all (including you Hrant) for the nice words - it went smoother than I expected...   \n   \n-Mads Rahbek Hougaard\n\n"
