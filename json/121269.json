  "content": "Hi I am starting up an Eyelash Extension spa- the logo picture is a very rough draft. My demographic is early 20s to late 40s with average being late 20s-early 30s. Am trying to convey an upscale, chic, modern (but not cold), stylish, with elegant/feminine touch. Suggestions of typefaces is VERY appreciated! Have been going crazy trying to find something that looks ok. Was thinking modern/script but am open to other typefaces/script. Also what would you recommend then for tagline? (Logo might be edited with box around it and/or without tagline). Again your guys feedback is very very much appreciated!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [lashesbabyadviselogo.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202857/http:/typophile.com/files/lashesbabyadviselogo.pdf) | 164.31 KB |\n\n",
