I wasn't   \ninspired by any existing face in particular, but i guess there must be some similar fonts out there. I saw a similar one at [thirstype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416054033/http:/www.thirstype.com/index.html)   \n   \nThis is my third digital type face, and i know it has some problems. But i like it very much and i have spent a lot of time in its design so i would like to finish it and get the best font i can. Any comments would be very much appreciated. i especially have doubts about numbers and some lc glyphs:k,i,j,t.   \n   \nThanks for any help or comments in advance.!-/attachment-!\\>!-attachment:\\> \n",

When this thing is a typeface -something \\*other\\* people must like- this becomes a big issue. On a practical level, this means that you might consider putting it aside for a few weeks, then taking a fresh look at it.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

However, most of the characters are awkward, as if they're forced into that curved shape, (A, C, H, 7, etc.)   \n   \nPerhaps there's some way to preserve what's interesting about that shape without forcing the other characters into unnatural configurations.   \n   \nGood luck with it.   \n   \n//joe\n\n"
