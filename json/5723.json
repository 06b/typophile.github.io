I don't like the italic type. What is the gray? Is it a tree? I'd lose it.   \n   \nI think there is still some exploration to do here. I did some conceptualization for an identity that incorporated a rhino a while back. I lost the digital files due to a HD failure, but I might be able to dig up some sketches in the morning. They might spark something, or not.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

If they are side-by-side as in version 1 and 2, they shouldn't touch ... because the eye wants to see them as \"one thing and another thing\", not \"one thingand another thing\" (pardon my English).   \n   \nIf they on the other hand are intertwined, it's okay ... but watch out for production difficulties.   \n   \nI think the 'tree' must have to go.   \n   \nBeware that in version 1 and 2 there is too much space around A.   \n   \nIn version 3, could you avoid \"cropping the angus with a scalpel\"? You may have to put the angus in a frame ... I haven't got any solution to this right now ... Maybe version 2 could be realized ...   \n   \n--   \nSoren O\n\n"

Udder dip, mating supplies and bull um... well lets just say essence... and there is so much cow imagry in marketing pieces and ads and so forth that a mark that is distilled down to a quicky symbol may play stronger than a more illustrative approach. Just a thought -   \n   \nhaving said that so far I like #2, but agree with Scott about flipping the type right side up at the bottom - perhaps also think of using that seal without an enclosure around the type.\n\n"

Perhaps you should think more \"ranch\" than individual \"cow\". Your design could show a few cows in a field, indicating breeding cow (without going completely graphic) rather than hamburger. Or not even show a cow, a branding iron, rope or fence sign are quick imagery that comes to mind when thinking ranch. Maybe it's something as simple as showing a whole cow to get rid of the food association, the severed head sort of leads one to think of butchery.\n\n"
