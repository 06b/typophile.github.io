  "content": "hello\n\nim looking for a \"helveticaesque\" grotesque (no, not helvetica!). no frutiger, no myriad, rather along the lines of akkurat or akzidenz grotesk. any further ideas?\n\nit doesnt have to look very modern. monotype grotesque would be an option too, for example. it will be used in an art project about definitions, but its for a school application so i dont want to use helvetica (they could think that i havent thought about font-choice). oh, and it doesnt need to be perfect for setting long texts.. will mostly be used between 10-20pt on small pages anyway.\n\nthanks!\n\n",
