Another is _Rolling Stone_ magazine.\n\nSee also:  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude/inuse](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131123608/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude/inuse \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude/inuse\")  \n [http://www.christianschwartz.com/amplitude.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131123608/http:/www.christianschwartz.com/amplitude.shtml \"http://www.christianschwartz.com/amplitude.shtml\")\n\n"
