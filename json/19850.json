  "content": "Hi guys!\n\nI am designing a four page brochure for a Medical University.\n\nThe fonts I have picked for the project are\n\nSans – Headline Serif – Body Text\n\nFF Scala Sans and Serif or  \nFF Nexus Sans and Serif or  \nFF Absara Sans and Serif\n\nI wanted to use Gill Sans initially, but I think it is overused and besides there is no Gill Serif to go with it. IMHO these fonts though resemble it, are actually better.\n\nIf you guys were to pick 2 pairs among these what would it be? Better if anyone of you can tell me what the actual difference between them is and which to go for.\n\nPlease help me with your expertise in this regard. I would be grateful for the same.\n\nRegards,\n\nlordkv\n\nP.S - I have attached the preview versions of all three in order of Scala (Left), Nexus (Right) and Absara (Below)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Untitled-1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120312001008/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_10.jpg) | 106.39 KB |\n| [Untitled-2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120312001008/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-2_6.jpg) | 112.5 KB |\n\n",

However, I recommend you choose the one you like.\n\nAlso think about Amor from Storm Type Foundry:  \n [http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/pdf.php?pdf=F58](http://web.archive.org/web/20120312001008/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/pdf.php?pdf=F58 \"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/pdf.php?pdf=F58\")\n\nIts maybe to soft for your project though... but check out the PDF to see if you like it.\n\nAll my best,\n\nMikey\n\n"

From what I understand, Martin Majoor closely studied Gill's designs when creating the Scala family.\n\nAs for Gill Sans being overused, I don't think anyone can justly fault you if you use it well.\n\n"

Yeah luckily dough is not a factor at all as i get good returns from it.\n\nFedra's good but not sure about it as not seen it in action.
