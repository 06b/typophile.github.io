  "content": "Last week I downloaded a copy of the Iraq Report from this Web site: [http://www.usip.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150114004930/http:/www.usip.org/ \"http://www.usip.org\")\n\nUpon opening the document, I noticed right away that the text was set in a sans serif face. I opened the doc in Acrobat Professional, highlighted some text, and checked the properties. Sure enough, the typeface was supposed to be Times New Roman MS. Since the fonts were substituted, all bold and other shifts in weight were ignored. I contacted the Web site's webmaster about 5 days ago, making a case for embedding the fonts and reposting the document.\n\nI just got an email back with the report attached and a thanks for my concern.\n\nWell, the same problem exists in this file as well.\n\nPlease forgive my naivete on the matter, but is this a problem involving their lack of embedding, or is it a font file format issues? I really don't know what format TNR-MS is, but I am on a Mac, so i'm wondering if the issue really is about compatability.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts on this that would clear things up for me I would really appreciate the help.\n\n",

This is a normal version of the document!\n\nI see in your screen shot that it says \"Actual Font: Adobe Sans MM\"\n\nIn the version you posted, the same area says \"Actual Font: Adobe Serif MM\"\n\nAnbody have any idea why there's a difference? I'm guessing this is the root cause of the issue.\n\n"
