Several typefaces have seen the daylight and become popular among the design community around the world. MRF look forward to continuing this tradition — for many years to come!\n\n[http://www.macrhino.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202225808/http:/www.macrhino.com/ \"http://www.macrhino.com\")  \n...............................................................................................................................\n\nNEW SITE/NEW DESIGN  \nWe say it's new because the content is mostly different from the earlier website. Due to a couple of productive years, several new designs have now been featured and displayed properly. Apart from the core type section (which have been expanded and optimised) several galleries of type in use have been added. One for Retail type in use and another for custom type in use. Last (but not least) is a section called The world of type, showing off sad, ugly and just beautiful typography surrounding us.\n\n[http://www.macrhino.com/retailtypeinuse.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202225808/http:/www.macrhino.com/retailtypeinuse.html \"http://www.macrhino.com/retailtypeinuse.html\")  \n [http://www.macrhino.com/customtypeinuse.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202225808/http:/www.macrhino.com/customtypeinuse.html \"http://www.macrhino.com/customtypeinuse.html\")  \n [http://www.macrhino.com/worldoftype.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202225808/http:/www.macrhino.com/worldoftype.html \"http://www.macrhino.com/worldoftype.html\")  \n..............................................................................................................................\n\nTYPE SPECIMEN ETC.  \nMerchandise is another priority taken care of. MRF know from experience that customers like specimens t-shirts and other goods. Now MRF have started up sales in a small scale and offers a few goodies to begin with. This section will be expanded in the future.\n\n[http://www.macrhino.com/merchandise.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202225808/http:/www.macrhino.com/merchandise.html \"http://www.macrhino.com/merchandise.html\")  \n...............................................................................................................................\n\nNEW TYPEFACE  \nEuroglory – a smooth sans serif with rounded edges. Straight enough to be a corporate workhorse and built as a solid companion for magazine work. Made in two steps and part two of this family became available as a retail typeface through Veer Inc, earlier this year. See the full story behind it and be sure to download the pdf-specimen.\n\n[http://www.macrhino.com/euroglory.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202225808/http:/www.macrhino.com/euroglory.html \"http://www.macrhino.com/euroglory.html\")  \n...............................................................................................................................\n\nFREE STUFF  \nAs before MRF still have a few single weight typefaces to offer for free.\n\n[http://www.macrhino.com/free.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202225808/http:/www.macrhino.com/free.html \"http://www.macrhino.com/free.html\")  \n...............................................................................................................................\n\nABOUT MRF  \nThe foundry operates as an independent studio, collaborating with its partners in various disciplines whenever necessary. Apart from the retail designs MRF also specializes in custom type design. The founder Stefan Hattenbach have been focusing on type design ever since his first typeface in 1996.\n\n[http://www.macrhino.com/services.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202225808/http:/www.macrhino.com/services.html \"http://www.macrhino.com/services.html\")\n\n",
