If they were correctly names, then you would see something like\n\nPolitica  \nPolitica Light\n\nA style-linked family consists of up 4 fonts including regular, italic, bold and bold italic, which should appear in the font menu under a single name.\n\nIn Adobe apps, there is a font menu and a style menu, and what you see in each depends on the format of font used and how the name table entries are made in the font.\n\nIt would be helpful to know what format these fonts are (PS Type 1? OTF? TTF?) and if you can post a screenshot showing what you see in the Illustrator menus that would also be helpful.\n\n"
