The result, [Linotype Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20130613050332/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype%20Univers), includes 63 different weights, each drawn carefully to ensure compatibility with all the others.\n\n[The original Univers type family](http://web.archive.org/web/20130613050332/http:/www.linotype.com/1560/univers-family.html) can be found online [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130613050332/http:/www.linotype.com/1560/univers-family.html). Linotype Univers can be found on this [overview page](http://web.archive.org/web/20130613050332/http:/www.linotype.com/6-1813-6/linotypeunivers.html).\n\n",
