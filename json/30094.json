  "content": "I'm looking for a delicate Didone or Modern typeface. I want something elegant, with lower contrast than a standard Bodoni, preferably in a light or ultralight weight. Maybe something almost monlinear, but not quite.\n\nLinotype Didot has a really thin hairline, but the contrast is still too thick. It also feels too rigid, with a very, very strict vertical stress.\n\nFilosofia has a more monlinear feel, but isn't that thin, and certainly not delicate.\n\nI already have a few cuts of Kepler, but it's too workman-like and the thin weights feel like they're about to poke you with their spikes.\n\nIt's for my Grandmother, who is a delicate, yet graceful. Wasp-ish, but calm and resolute. Soft and feminine.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

(Not a bad thing, but not what I want.)\n\nBodoni Egyptian – Very cool. That's more of what I was thinking, but not it yet. It still has to <cite>feel</cite> like a Modern. This is more of a typewriter.\n\nLet me revise that, I don't need a monoline. I want a lower contrast Didone in a thin weight. Something where the curves blend gracefully rather than abruptly.\n\n"

I like the Clarendon Light I idea, but I don't have the time, nor have I even developed the skills yet to do so.\n\nI'm doing a design for her tax office, and she will be ordering new office supplies and stationary sometime in mid-January, so I'm searching for something \"out of the box\" so to speak.\n\nBy the way, has anyone seen the Greek Font Society Bodoni? It has regular, italic, bold and bold italic weights, full Latin and Greek support and even has small caps! All wrapped up in a fully coded OpenType font. For FREE!!\n\n"
