  "content": "hello.  \nmy name is yaron and im a second year visual communications student from israel.\n\ni wanted to share a project i did for our illustration class.\n\ni created an illustration book (called \"Red Fur\") inspired by illuminated medieval books and later printed german books. i needed to make a logo that matches the theme, so i developed some \"hebrew blackletter\" letters using a font that i love called - \"willhelm klingspor gotisch\".\n\nthe title says \"Parva (fur) Aduma (red)\"\n\nyou can view the illustrations and some initials i designed in this set:  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/yaronimus/sets/72057594064500349/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424143223/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/yaronimus/sets/72057594064500349/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/yaronimus/sets/72057594064500349/\")\n\ni'll post some initials soon.\n\n",

It looks like \"qio\", with the dot on the i falling over. Normally, I don't think that I would \"read\" English (or whatever) into Hebrew, but since you are using such an iconic Latin design, it is too hard to avoid.\n\n"
