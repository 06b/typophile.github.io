Honestly the 1st and second seem too trendy to me. Being young and working with a lot of \"hipsters\" (haha) I see this kind of stuff all the time, of course your specimen is way better executed.\n\nI really like where you are going with the 4th, great work.\n\n"

This is what I like about #4: readability (I'm not feeling the font choice though), the two wing feather vs three and letter spacing. You might want to try the font used in 3 and let it breath a little more and instead of the three wings use two. just some thoughts.\n\n"

I, too, see the Topgun thing, and am wondering if the wings were turned upside down they'd resonate \"train\" more than they do \"flight.\" But it'd have to reduced to 2 bars, because 3 might look too much like an E...and then maybe only use it on the right...this would suggest an industrious forward moving attitude...is that TOO much suggesting?\n\n"
