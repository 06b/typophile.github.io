There is alot out there about his use of type but I am looking for analysis of his type designs (the inspirations, methods of production, indepth look at particular letterforms, etc). I have his two monographs and have trawled the font bureau websites already...\n\n",

I'd be surprised if constructivism weren't an influence for Industria as well as some of his other faces. For a designer of his profile, it is surprising that there aren't that many good studies online.\n\n\"Gorbachev, perestroika...\"  \nI'm not so aware of the particular influences of these on graphic design. Nick, I'd be grateful for any elaboration.\n\n"

      "content": "Insignia and Industria were done before FB got involved, but FF Blur, FF Typeface 6 and 7, FF World, FF Gothic, FF Tokyo, FF Typeface 4, and FF Pop were all developed with inspiration from logos and simple display faces made for NB's clients. Methods of production were standard for this kind of work, with Brody providing T. Frere-Jones and myself with the existing work, we grew the glyph set to standard, separated various ideas engulfed in the designs into styles and weights that others could use, and bounced particular letterforms across the sea. What started as 4-5 styles, ended with 10-12. Later, when all the main tasks were done, TFJ and I went to Berlin, finalized most of the details with NB and then the works were manufactured at FF and released. Blur was slightly different, with TFJ working on that with NB solo, mostly to establish some spacing that worked.\n\nI have not seen the monographs, what do they say?\n\nCheers!\n\n"
