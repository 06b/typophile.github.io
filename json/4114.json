      "content": "Yes it is doing-by-the-eye. However, here is a tip:   \n   \nWhen spacing letters it is impossible to space 2 letter incorrectly. It is the 3rd letter that will determine good spacing. Work through your word in 3 letter increments covering up the other letters. Once done, check the complete word and fine tune.   \n   \neg. for the word Aquatoad check Aqu, then qua, uat, ato and so on.   \n   \nOh, and pray the word you're spacing isn't LJIIWLA   \nSome words are bound to have problems. Time to get creative, make ligatures, shave letters etc.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

The sizes at which your logotype will be reproduced drastically affect the kerning. You need to do something else Henrik. Convert it to outlines, then kern it until you like it. Try making three versions; very small, medium and very large. Use those sizes as needed.\n\n"

(No grades handed out here :-) I picked the word ATLANTA because it has combinations that need obvious kerning, one real headache, and I was just in Atlanta yesterday.   \n   \nI might make minor adjustments to things.   \n1. AT ------TA should have the same spacing   \n2. ATL looks good   \n3. LA this is the headache. There will be a hole here. You can minimize it as you did by shortening the L. I might shave a bit more off. It also might suggest a little looser word spacing overall so the hole won't stand out as much.   \n4. TL vs NT, NT maybe want a bit more space than TL because the N is more dense than the L. What you're trying to do is set up a good rythm between light and dark.   \n   \nIf this was going to be a logo, you might look into an LA ligature, maybe a TL ligature, maybe an NT ligature. If not you might angle the right ends of the T's to mirror the new L. In other words, make this custom not a stock font. This is Frank's point, and a good one. (That and smaller sizes wants looser spacing).   \n   \nI say maybe and might because your eyes and my eyes see differently. You're eyes might want to narrow the arms on the T. That might help.   \n   \nHave fun!   \nRandy\n\n"
