  "content": "I'm looking for a database of font information, specifically limited to those found on Linotype. For example, given the typeface CRONOS, I'd like to be able to know if it is:\n\n(sans/slab) serif?  \nmonospaced?  \ndisplay?  \nscript?\n\nI can certainly look at a font by hand and decide this for myself, but I was wondering for the program that I am writing, if there was a database or tool out there that determines this. I've looked at the Linux program `otfinfo` but it does not give any of this information.\n\n",
