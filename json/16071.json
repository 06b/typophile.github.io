I don't think they still have the reputation, but the name has stuck.\n\nThe point of Kevin's presentation in Helsinki was about the relationship between the pleasurable aesthetic experience of typography and measurable increase in cognitive performance, based on related work in which people are found to perform problem solving tasks more easily and quickly after an enjoyable mental experience such as watching an amusing video rather than a dry lecture. So not directly related to the crapshoot of trying to increase readership in a competetive newspaper market.\n\n"

Anyway it's more useful to compare papers that  \nare in the same arena.

They were outweighed by the brilliance, though.\n\nAt first, I didn't take to it, and I think that's why there are usually letters from readers who don't like their habits disrupted.\n\n"
