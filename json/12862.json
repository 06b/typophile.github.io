See some examples below. In [letterpress](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218042642/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Letterpress) practice, case refers to the physical box (case), usually wooden, that a given set of letters is stored. Capital letters were stored in the upper (top) case and lowercase letters were stored in the lower (bottom) case.\n\nExamples:\n\nALL CAPS -- All letters are capitalized.\n\nTitle Case -- The first letter of each word is capitalized.\n\nSentence case -- where the first character is capital and the remaining words are lowercase.\n\nCamel Case -- Also called internal caps where one or more characters in a given word (or string) has a capitalized letter. This is often used in programming languages and increasingly seen for naming or branding companies or products.\n\n**[Indices](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218042642/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Indices) : [Technical Info](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218042642/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Technical%20Info) : [Feature Tags](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218042642/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Feature%20Tags) : case**\n\n'case' is an [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218042642/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) [feature tag](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218042642/http:/typophile.com/wiki/feature%20tag) with the friendly name \"Case-Sensitive Forms\".
