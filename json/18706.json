She will discuss how and why she guided her career away from traditional hand lettering work into designing and producing digital type, logos and marks and yet retains the spirit and essence of her training.\n\nJoin Jill after the lecture for a workshop exploring ways to add panache to your handwriting and in turn enhance your design skills. No previous experience required.\n\n[Download](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116152932/http:/kansascity.aiga.org/1pdf/JillBell.pdf) event flyer and workshop supply list (pdf)\n\n**LECTURE:  \nSaturday, April 22, 2006**    \n10:00am - 11:30am (includes Q&A)  \nJohnson County Community College  \nLittle Theatre, GEB 233  \nCollege Blvd and Quivara Rd  \nOverland Park, KS 66210\n\n**WORKSHOP:  \nSaturday, April 22, 2006**    \nlimited to 30 participants  \n12:00pm - 3:00pm (includes Q&A)  \nJohnson County Community College  \nLittle Theatre, GEB 233  \nCollege Blvd and Quivara Rd  \nOverland Park, KS 66210\n\nLearn more about this lecture and workshop and register online.\n\n",
