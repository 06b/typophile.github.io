      "content": "Helvetica is not very geometric, IMO.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by “terminals paralel to the baseline”. Are you talking about how Gothams terminals are at an angle, as opposed to completely vertical or horizontal? Perhaps you'd like [Graphik](http://web.archive.org/web/20100818074147/http:/typographica.org/2008/typeface-reviews/graphik/) or [Galaxie Polaris](http://web.archive.org/web/20100818074147/http:/www.vllg.com/Village/Galaxie_Polaris#panel=poster)? (The latter doesn't have the 90 degree terminals, but they are rather close to it.) Another one that might be of interest is [Neuzeit Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20100818074147/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/neuzeit-grotesk/).\n\n"

I'm looking for something whitout that angle. And yes helvetica is not as geometric as avant garde, I was just refering it as an example about it's terminals.\n\nAnyway, thanks a lot for your sugestions... very nice, Galaxie Polaris might be just what they're looking for.\n\nStill open to another suggestions though\n\n"
