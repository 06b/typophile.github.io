  "content": "As many of you have heard, Canadian typographer Jim Rimmer passed away in his home on Friday, January 8 after a courageous fight with cancer. Jim designed dozens of typefaces, most of which were issued digitally through P22, some released in metal through his Pie Tree Press & Typefoundry, and even a few faces were issued in both digital and metal formats.\n\nI was fortunate to have known Jim and to have learned from him how to print and how to cut my own type in metal, but most of all to have been friends with the man over the past 12 years. Undoubtedly there will be many tributes to Jim, one of which is the Facebook page Remembering Jim Rimmer, which you can see -- and contribute to -- here:\n\n[http://www.facebook.com/pages/Remembering-Jim-Rimmer/277069136998](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020030234/http:/www.facebook.com/pages/Remembering-Jim-Rimmer/277069136998 \"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Remembering-Jim-Rimmer/277069136998\")\n\n",

      "content": "My favourite memories of Jim involve visits to his workshop in New Westminster: one of those very humane workspaces that printers seem so good at creating for themselves. Of course, Jim was both a printer and a typefounder, and the two rooms expressed something of the natures of these two undertakings: the printing room expansive and light, filled with warm wood and carefully cleaned pressed; the foundry cramped and dark, filled with lead-spattering and jerry-rigged industrial machinery.\n\nIn 2003, Brian Morgan and I went to document Jim cutting and casting a keepsake for that year's ATypI conference in Vancouver, and I'm pleased to see that the [photographs and account of that visit](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020030234/http:/www.atypi.org/news_tool/news_html?newsid=127&from=) are still on the ATypI website.\n\n"

      "content": "Mr Rimmer was my first type hero, as a young graphic designer in the late '80s. His Albertan was used extensively in Mediamatic Magazine back then, and I loved the way it looked, especially at display sizes. It took me several months, back in the pre-internet days, to identify it. I still have the original floppy from Giampa. Rest in peace, Mr Rimmer.\n\n"

This was the last day of ATypI in Vancouver back in 2003. Michelle Hill and I bailed on the afternoon sessions and drove over to Jim's. It was wonderfully inspiring and educational.\n\nI only wish that I'd been able to take him up on his standing invitation to come spend a week working with him, learning to cut matrices and cast type.\n\n"
