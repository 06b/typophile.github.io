Also, the text \"SAGA OF THE STORM\" at the top of the image appears to be actually typed with the Caps Lock on. I've never seen the font at a large size and this is about the best I can do in terms of an image. If it's any help, the image is from a 2001 screenshot.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110524170742im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Warlord%20font_4232.PNG)\n\n",
