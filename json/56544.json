      "content": "hey Ashley,\n\nI like your approach!\n\nThe two things that stick out to me on first glance are:\n\n\\*the circular letters - I wonder if the stroke keeps going too far on the inside, making a sort of double-walled letter  \n\\*the I, T, r, and e seem too geometric for the otherwise playful approach and execution.\n\nOh, also in your real cookie dough, the baselines aren't straight, which I actually find somewhat charming.\n\nlove to see where it goes!\n\n"

The 'd' in the digital version doesn't work for me.\n\nBy the way: I assume you want to use the lettering for headlines. Perhaps you could make a couple of versions per letter and just photograph them all instead of using digital lettering. That way you could compose them together. The digital version looses its charm.\n\nGood work, dough. ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "The dough design looks delicious. OK. Sorry. I got carried away.\n\nI really like this concept. Here are my issues with the digital version:  \n(1) I can't decide if it says, \"dough\" or \"hugh.\"  \n(2) Notice how in the dough version the baseline of the letters are curvy and organic? Well, you stripped all that out in the digital version, which makes it look decidedly less \"doughy.\"  \n(3) Related to (2), some of the glyphs have lost playfulness with the straight baselines as well, particularly the 'd', the 'y' and the 'r'.\n\nAll that said, however, good job with getting your creative inspiration!\n\n--  \nNick Hladek\n\n"
