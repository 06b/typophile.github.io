      "content": "I have to agree with Penn. I assume Russell posted it here for an honest crit, so 'here goes':\n\nI applaud the designer for reaching out and doing a card on black stock. It would have been stronger, however, as a simple 1/0 offset job, on a non-linen stock. Perhaps if it were without the house icon, without the second ghosted/textured (foiled?) background version of OHG, and without the signage•wayfinding•identity+yellow arrow combination. It may work as a showcase for AG Letterpress, and the various printing tricks they can execute. The design itself, however, has too many elements. The combination of extra elements, multiple printing methods/inks, and a textured linen stock combine to make this into a 'supercard'. Also, It looks like it may have been trimmed very tight on the left of the OHG. If those unnecessary elements were removed, and a simpler execution used, the designer could then take advantage of the extra breathing room. On a larger piece, such as a large outdoor sign, it might be possible to include all these elements, but on something as small as a business card, it's just too much.\n\nSteve\n\n"

It's sort of bit late for me to be asking for a crit, 'cause they've already been printed and paid for, but I'll go with \"super-card\". My day job calls for lots of tight and sparce so in my freelancing, I like to \"cut loose\" a bit where I can and this card works quite well for me in that regard.\n\nThere is, by the way, only one printing method involved. I lit the photo to high-light the impressions left by the press.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"
