      "content": "I second Wayfinding: People Signs Architecture by Arthur / Passini. (As far as I know, Romedi Passini coined the term “wayfinding”.) Anyway, this book describes very well the kind of problems people have with navigation, and with signage, in a very human way. I could quibble with some of the typographic advice, but it’s still an enormously helpful book. In my experience though, the problem with wayfinding is getting other people (designers / architects) to agree with the more fundamental descriptions of human subjectivity. For literature about that, I would recommend The Design of Everyday Things, by Don Norman. Although not specifically about wayfinding, he writes about user interaction with designed objects in such a way that useful lessons can still be drawn. “Make the right thing easy to do, make the wrong thing difficult or impossible to do, make it easy to fix mistakes, give feedback” — all principles which should apply to good wayfinding. In particular, the distictions he makes about long- and short-term memory, or knowledge in the head / knowledge in the world, are very useful to bear in mind when thinking and talking about how people understand signage and wayfinding.\n\n"
