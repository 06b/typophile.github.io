  "content": "Hello everyone,  \nI've a question about horizontal and vertical stems in FontLab.  \nGoing to Font Info --\\> Hinting Settings --\\> Standard stems (T1 hinting) it is possible to define values for horizontal and vertical font's standard stems.  \nBut when I'm in a blank Glyph Window is there a way to visualize horizontal and vertical hints based on those values?  \nI mean, how can I make those values useful for the designing process of the glyphs?  \nThank you for your help!\n\n",

However, you can see stem thicknesses of current stems, by autohinting them (F7). If you then use the option to convert hints to links, the links will dynamically adjust when you make changes to the outlines, to always show the current measurement.\n\n"
