  "content": "Mainly interested in identifying the “HAMPSHIRE” portion of the lettering, but would also be interested if the “New” is any known script font, though I assume that’s probably hand-lettered. The swash “S” is obviously hand-modified, of course.

      "content": "I have my doubts that HAMPSHIRE is a font (I definitely think New is hand-drawn). To me this looks like some of the work of Chuck Davis and other guys at Letterhead Fonts, which means is could be almost any commercial sign artist’s work. The only duplicated letter in the word is the H and the proportions of both are not the same. Sure, it could be graphic ’squooshing’, but I think this may be custom lettering, and not a font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
