DIN Mittelschrift is one very famous example.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080316192733im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gConstruct_5211.jpg)\n\nSince the »Romain du Roi« we know that it is tricky to draw a geometrical typeface. For optical reasons you have to go away from circles and lines with exactly one weight. Therefore the aim was not to construct a typeface but to draw it in a way that appears constructed. As you can see in the picture, the final typeface is very different.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080316192733im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WasserKonsens_5229.jpg)\n\nThe design of a typeface is like stage production. Like strongly made up actors, the characters of a typeface must be super-elevated, to be very clear in there role. Particularly in small sizes.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080316192733im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KonFetten_3867.jpg)\n\nKonsens has 9 weights from Light to Ultrabold with italics like most of my other families. In addition to that there a Stencil headline companion. It also has got 9 weights but no italics.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080316192733im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WasserKonsensSten2_5661.jpg)\n\n[www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/Konsens/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080316192733/http:/www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/Konsens/ \"www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/Konsens/\")  \n [www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/KonsensSten/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080316192733/http:/www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/KonsensSten/ \"www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/KonsensSten/\")\n\n",
