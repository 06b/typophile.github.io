Attached image is from their blog and is the largest image I could find. Sorry!\n\nKristin\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215140058im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LibertyofLondonlogo_5489.jpg)\n\n",

I'm sorry that was unclear.\n\nThere is a slightly larger version here:\n\n[http://www.liberty.co.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215140058/http:/www.liberty.co.uk/ \"http://www.liberty.co.uk/\")\n\nIf you compare it with the liberty you linked, you'll see that the serifs have been snipped off.\n\n"

      "content": "If you would agree that the only difference is the clipped serifs, then I think we can say \"slightly modified Liberty\" is the answer. It was a little harder to see the missing serifs the way the above image was cropped. It shows up better on the web page.At the low screen resolution it's even possible that the serifs just aren't showing up against the black background (I thought).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Mike, you are misunderstanding the point of my post.\n\nI'm not questioning your font identification. I knew what the font was based on when I began my original post. See how I mention that the logo is \"Linotype's liberty font without the serifs\". That's me saying the logo is based on Liberty, that Liberty is owned by Linotype, but that the logo uses an altered version \"without the serifs\".\n\nI'm going to assume that there is no font available and I'll look into purchasing font alteration from Linotype if I my creative team wants to pay the fees.\n\nThanks,\n\nKristin\n\n"
