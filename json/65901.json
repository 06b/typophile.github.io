Could it fit?\n\nSecond, do you think Museo can be a good font for body text or is it best to limit its use to titels and short bursts of text?\n\nThird, in case you think the font is not suited for body text, could be museo sans [http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museosans.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043139/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museosans.html) a decent one?\n\nThanks\n\n",
