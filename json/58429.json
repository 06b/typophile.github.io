Can you take a look on your end and tell me if you see a problem with it?

Beyond that, it applies semantic meaning to the text indicating a \"paragraph\" of copy, but that doesn't actually mean anything in terms of positioning.\n\nIt isn't inherently bad form to assign css to copy via a containing div — in fact it can save on file size, but I tend to prefer using p tags since then at the beginning of your css style sheet, you just say:\n\np {  \n stuff  \n}\n\nand it will apply those rules to every single one on the page. I guess for me, it also helps me think, \"ok, this is text because it is in a p tag.\"\n\nActually, basic typographic/layout ideas are not impossible on the web. I've seen some work that is done extremely well that follows those principles. The one I usually present is [Wilson Miner's site](http://web.archive.org/web/20101205024418/http:/www.wilsonminer.com/ \"Wilson Miner\"). Figuring out how to think in terms of web development to make your print-inspired typography and layouts work is the biggest difficulty. That just takes time and practice.

It's so much faster to just muck with the markup directly than to do the back and forth explanations.\n\nIndeed, if your text is a paragraph of text, you should be using paragraph tags. While there are default styles for most tags in most browsers, you can 'zero them out' using CSS. Just one of many samples is Yahoo's reset.css: [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/](http://web.archive.org/web/20101205024418/http:/developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/ \"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/\")\n\nAs for dealing with baseline grids, the basic premise is that all of your element's styles have to conform to fall within whatever increment you are using for the grid.\n\nSo, if you're using a 20px grid, then your header tags' line-height, padding and margin would have to add up to 20px or 40px or 60px, or etc...\n\n"
