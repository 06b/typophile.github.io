  "content": "Dear all   \n   \nI wonder if someone can give us a hand trying to find out which are the fonts (or the font if it is only one) used on this titling for a book cover. So far we have only found Trajan and ITC Cerigo that ressemble the sample, but note the flat tip of the upper case A (unlike Trajan), and also the sans-serif middle bar of the E. The ampersand, being uncommon, should be relatively easy to track down, but we have not come across something like it within a font ressembling the other characters. Please disregard the long vowel marks and the underdots, unless you have some specific information.   \n   \nMANY THANKS IN ADVANCE!   \n   \nJA ![ghazali jpeg](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224621im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42430.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "The italic in the sample is more calligraphic than slimbach... it would be helpful to know the source and when it's from. Could be pre-digital? Shares some character traits with Bembo, like the cap A, but it is not Bembo.\n\n"
