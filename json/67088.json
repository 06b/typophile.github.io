  "content": "Hi everyone, newcomer here.\n\nOk, so im doing a thesis project on a display font. My typeface is going to be design in a 2x6 grid. So it would be align vertically and horizontal.\n\nI want to see what you guys think about it, also if you have any resources or if you know any information on grid fonts.\n\nThe person that actually got me into this whole grid base was Wim Crouwel, got his book as a ref.\n\nthanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pic1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100215181510/http:/typophile.com/files/pic1_0.jpg) | 880.22 KB |\n| [pic2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100215181510/http:/typophile.com/files/pic2_1.jpg) | 989.43 KB |\n| [pic3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100215181510/http:/typophile.com/files/pic3_0.jpg) | 974.67 KB |\n\n",

I'm big fan of such condensed proportion.\n\nPerhaps you can research some pixel or computer related fonts for solutions, such as: [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/countdown-sh/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100215181510/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/countdown-sh/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/countdown-sh/\")\n\nGood luck, looking forward to seeing the final result.\n\n"
