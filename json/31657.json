The codepages, encodings and Unicode ranges are for orientation only. They are not stored inside of OpenType fonts (unless you set the FontLab Studio Preferences to enable some special encoding options.)\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"

A glyphname and a Unicode codepoint will be assigned automatically. (If you know the correct glyphname for your glyph, you can use Glyph / Generate Glyphs and type it there.) If your glyph is not a default representation of a Unicode character (i.e. it's a ligature, a variant glyph etc.), you need to name the glyph according to the recommendations described in the \"Glyph Naming and Encoding\" section of the FontLab Studio manual.\n\nA.\n\n"
