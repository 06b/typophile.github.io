  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI need an organiser (agenda in dutch.. I believe that is an organiser in english, right?). I'v been looking everywhere to find a nice typographic one, but can't find any.  \nWell... I probably haven't looked everywhere. I've checked veer.com. Nice stuff.. but no organisers and they don't seem to ship to Europe... WHY NOT!??! I finally got a job and I can spend some money on cool typographic stuff... and they just don't ship it to Holland.. =(  \nI also checked fontshop and some other font foundries, but didn't get lucky. I did get the little notebook from fontshop in the mail the other day, but it's a notebook and it doesn't give me dates where I can write stuff down.\n\nIf anyone knows a nice typographic organiser please let me know!\n\ncheers,  \ndav2.\n\n",

Too bad the 2008 one is already sold out... but I signed up for the 2009 one now.\n\nLulu is also a very good one!! I forgot about that site.. but they got some nice stuff there for not a lot of money at all!  \nAlthough the word book doesn't really seem like a organiser... but I had already downloaded that one somewhere else... don't remember where I got it.\n\nI've also emailed ordning-edna in belgium about shipping options, but no reply so far. Some of the covers seem ok, minimalistic.. just too bad I can't see how they are inside... (also emailed them about that.\n\nthanks people.. guess I'm just way too late to start looking for organisers now. Still if anyone finds anything plz let me know!\n\ncheers!  \ndav2.\n\n"
