We have to use Rotis Semi Sans for the body copy (corporate style and all) but what we use for headings is open. The design/content of the magazine is fairly straight and serious, but we’re looking to make it a little cleaner, sharper and more contemporary while still maintaining its professional (somewhat straightlaced) positioning.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n [‹ Newspaper Typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120090918/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32821 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Letters in metal ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120090918/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32872 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "\\> _What goes with Rotis?_  \n&nbsp; &nbsp; —Answer: Potatoes.\n\nSorry, just a little Aicher humour. Many of Otl Aicher’s design theories were cooked up in the kitchen, as presented in his book »die küche zum kochen« (_The Kitchen’s for Cooking_), and _rotis_ was derived from his town Rotis/Allgäu and for both “cooking” ideas and food.\n\nSince Rotis Semisans is **mandated** by your corporate style guide, I strongly suggest that you follow the styles presented in the corporate literature of [**ERCO** _the light factory_.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120090918/http:/www.erco.com/en_index.htm?http://www.erco.com/download/en/en_index_download.htm)\n\nThe [Rotis type family](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120090918/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/product/172715/?mode=alpha) was developed much from Aicher’s own theories on typography and readability, and as such, works better in concept than in practical application.\n\nThe reason why you should closely review the usage of Rotis by ERCO is because Klaus-Jürgen Maack, the founder also ran the famous family printing firm Druckhaus Maack. It was through the strong relationship of Aicher and Maack that Rotis became possible, thus ERCO adapted it as the corporate typeface.\n\nI would say that ERCO made great efforts in adapting the type family for literature as well as titling on their web site. You might as well benefit from one of the best usage of Rotis I have seen, and mind you, that is no easy task.\n\nERCO product and corporate literature PDFs download links:  \n\\> [Main literature download page](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120090918/http:/www.erco.com/en_index.htm?http://www.erco.com/download/en/en_index_download.htm)  \n\\> [ERCO — Vertical Illuminance](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120090918/http:/www.erco.com/en_index.htm?http://www.erco.com/~klickmeister/km_ls_download/ls_download.pl?_startseite=en=20_specsheets/10_indoor_specsheet) Brochure, a “must see” for Rotis type usage.\n\n"

      "content": "BTW Andre — I think JY Décennie may work very well for titles with Rotis Semisans as text. It looks far more delicate in design when compared to Rotis Serif and just might take the “edge” off a very corporate look for the magazine.\n\n"
