  "content": "Trixie is a distressed monospaced serif typeface created by Dutch type designer, Erik Van Blokland, in 1991 using the inspiration of an old, worn typewriter. Probably the most famous presentation of a single letter is the Trixie capital X used in the title of the popular science fiction television series, \"The X-Files\".\n\nSince its release in 1991, from “The X-Files” to more recent appearances in \"Capote\" and \"Atonement\", FF Trixie has served as the defacto typeface of mystery and intrigue. Although there have been a number of typewriter-like designs, FF Trixie remains the most convincing, and accurate, typewriter font available.\n\nMore information, production samples and technical specifications are available at the [Trixie Font Site](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013154939/http:/trixiefont.com/) and the [foundry site](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013154939/http:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/trixie).\n\n",
