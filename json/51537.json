Then give the package to makers of operating systems, windows, mac and linux, to include in their system font package.  \nThis way, the web designers will have the option to use fonts that a) work on any platform b) are optimized for web viewing, both in terms of clarity and in terms of balance between Roman and Arabic, while maintaining the integrity of Arabic script.  \nHow about that Amsterdam?!\n\n",

But technically speaking, my idea is a bit more complex than that.  \nI don't urge operating system makers to go and shop around to see what free Arabic font is available and collect them. This is what users do! They will not do it and I don't want them to do it either.\n\nOn the technical side, the fonts in the package has to go through serious and reliable tests in terms of their proper functionality on various platforms. For one thing for example, that Nasta'liq font doesn't have AAT and won't work on older Macs.  \nOn the visual side, I'm not sure that font can meet the web clarity requirements, particularly on Windows platform.\n\nSo what I mean is a serious concerted effort to produce a package with a credible stamp of approval. Otherwise, Linux may go for it, but not the two others.\n\n"

But throwing the idea is a good start I hope.\n\nI was thinking of a 'package' of fonts because as you may have noticed, the idea of what constitutes a single good standard Arabic web font may vary substantially. So it's good that you mentioned two fonts because I think at least we need two typeface. One with basic ligatures for Arab users, another one without ligatures for mostely non Arabs. I don't know how much the language identification can be reliable for this on different platforms and different browsers. Besides, there may be an Arabic site that doesn't want to have ligature or vice-versa. Then of-course there might be different views about what style is more 'standard' for the web. I am leaning toward a simplified Naskh, something simialr to Geeza Pro and Yagut. Others may have other ideas. This is basically a topic for exploring the idea.\n\nThere may well be that at some point, embedded fonts will be supported on all platforms and all browsers and web designers will be less dependent on system fonts. This also may be a solution for Arabic web situation, both for Arabic language and particularly for non Arabic languages. But it is certainly not a solution for quality font making.\n\nHinting is generally a trade secret. I have no knowledge of it. Is hinting model as good as pixel display?\n\n"

Hinting is, simply stated, a means of influencing outlines at specific sizes and resolutions in order to obtain a better rasterised image (rasterisation is the wrapping of outlines to pixel or other dot grids). The effects of hinting on the same outlines will, therefore, vary depending on the rasterisation model (binary pixel display, i.e. black and white, vs. greyscale antialiasing vs. subpixel colour antialiasing).\n\n"

I'll keep it in mind though!\n\nJohn I'd go with greyscale antialiasing if that is what is being done on the Mac. It is perfect for scripts with a lot of curvatures that in a small size can not simply be reduced to black and white pixels.  \nI know that it is partially a question of habit. I heard that some PC users were complaining that Safari on the PC is 'blurry'. So the habit may go the other way too. But definitively for Arabic script this should be a plus.  \nMy suggestion of a font face similar tp Yagut is mostly because the design is fairly resistant in becoming jagged in small size. It's a fairly thick design and fairly geometrical. A finer typeface without antialiasing is a desaster in small size. I know it because a site is currently using a finer face (that I made and didn't put anything other than authohinting of FontLab) and it looks very nice on the Mac but pretty unusable on a PC (unless perhaps Safari is being used).  \nIf hinting in the font can do what is automatically done on the Mac, this could be a sigh of relief because the typeface options for Arabic web fonts extends substantially.\n\n"

      "content": "You misunderstand. The rendering model used largely depends on the system or application, not on the font. For systems that offered both black and white bitmaps and greyscale antialiasing, it is possible to set flags in the font to turn on and off antialiasing at specific sizes and to apply or not apply hints. Colour subpixel rendering does not offer this option, and may selectively apply hints (MS ClearType ignores x-direction delta hints, for example) or ignore hints completely (Apple Quartz rendering). Also, different systems or applications may interpret the same hints in different ways.\n\nSome amount of hinting is desirable in pretty much any font -- unless one knows for sure that Apple Quartz rendering is the only environment in which the font will appear --, even if it is only to control vertical alignment zones. The kind of hinting we do for sub-pixel rendering environments tends to be quite minimal, concentrating on y-direction hints. Depending on the individual design, auto-hinting can sometimes take one a long way toward good results; other designs call for a lot of manual work.\n\n"

Since Arabic tends to have a greater range of letter heights, controlling alignment zones is trickier than for Latin, but in general terms the relative efficacy of (semi-)autohinting is typeface dependent, not script dependent.\n\n_Antialiesing gives best possible results._\n\nAntialiasing and hinting are not exclusive unless a particular rendering engine chooses to ignore hints completely (e.g. Apple's 'full-fuzz' Quartz rendering, which personally I can't stand). Most antialiasing makes use of hints in various ways.\n\n"

I know that there is a conceptual difference of opinion between two platforms in text rendering that is going on here that I fail to understand. But I can not fail my eyes. And my eyes tell me that to view properly an Arabic script, you need antialiasing. In fact, the goal of proper hinting of an Arabic web font should be to look like what it looks with antialiasing which of-course, may have the advantage of not having an unnecessary 'shadow' on a larger size. But to me, this minor advantage fades in the face of the fact that how limiting it has made the use of Arabic fonts on the web.  \nArabic glyphs don't loose their curvatures in size 12. Pixels do. And it is for text rendering engine to resolve this obvious fact not the font.. in my opinion. But this topic is for solving a font problem which should not have been a problem to begin with.\n\nNow in a parallel discussion that we had on our community site, Aziz (not the same Aziz, another one!) has posted the pictures of a text on the Mac and Windows, with and without ClearType and antialiasing, produced by two or three different fonts. ClearType somewhat improves the unbearable state of the text on the Windows. My question is that how much more improvement can be applied to the fonts with proper hinting? In these samples, Geeza and Yagut are fairly thick fonts (although it's hard to believe it in some pictures!) and Zar is moderately fine.  \n [http://balatwit.com/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223542/http:/balatwit.com/fonts/ \"http://balatwit.com/fonts/\")\n\n"

The only way that they are involved is that I want to get rid of them in web pages!  \nIn the practical usage of Arabic script, at least from what I know from Persian and what I see in Arabic, vowels are assumed, not written. This applies to the application localized versions too. Generally the extensive usage of vowels requires larger font size to accommodate the visibility of vowels. Occasional usage of vowels in web text is mostly used when writer can not 'assume' that the reader would know the proper pronunciation of the word.  \nSo my focus here for web fonts is not the vowels performance per se, but the characters clarity, which would also have a better rendition of vowels as a side effect. But the focus is on the characters themselves.  \nOn applications with antialiasing, this visibility in small size is already achieved. The problem for web pages is that they can not assume the user has this facility. I think that there is no global solution for this situation and web designers should assume that the users have at least a rendering technology such as ClearType at their disposal. This will make the text at least readable, although the font face would loose all its specificity in small size.  \nThe rest, I think, will fall on user shoulder to choose the proper tools for web viewing to his satisfaction. A font can not make miracle and if it could, it would be one single font with a lot of work. This limits substantially the web designer choice of page layout. It may well be that for Arabic web pages, the advent of embedded fonts would be the best and most practical solution. Although simplified Naskh is what I have in mind when thinking about web pages, the embedded font would allow all kind of styles, if the web designer see fit for his usage.\n\n"
