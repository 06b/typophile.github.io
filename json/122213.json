  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m looking for a font to pair with Goudy Old Style. I’m using GOS for the body text of a fantasy novel that takes place in ancient times, and I initially thought I might use Goudy Trajan (with swashes perhaps) for the chapter headers.\n\nHowever, I thought that Trajan would be cliched, and I’m leaning toward using Goudy’s Forum Titling instead for a fresher use of ‘ancient Rome’ fonts. The Lanston Type Company suggests 'hybridizing' GOS lowercases with Forum Titling's capitals, but I wondered if it might work if I used them as-is. I’m open to other options to pair with GOS, of course, just so long as the font evokes that ancient feel.\n\nThere is one caveat – I may need the font to be available for ebook licensing.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi,\n\nI see clarity is needed here -- I was asking for a Chapter Title header font (not a body font) that evokes ancient times. I specifically named two fonts that made this wish abundantly clear; I've never heard of writing body copy in Trajan. It's a type of font that could only be used for titles, etc., yes? The question was what **title** font is a useful alternative to Trajan in this context?\n\nI've found another source to answer this question, so thanks anyway.\n\n"
