It’s exciting to see how much information is available here.\n\nI have a typeface that I’d really like to be able to use without making it myself... and I’m hoping it’s already out there.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423050958im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/RES-COPEN-1_5017.jpg)\n\nMy grandfather always chewed this brand of tobacco... as odd as it sounds, the logo is familiar and warm to me. The typeface would look really great spelling my last name or in normal use... and I was hoping someone would recognize it... if it already exists.\n\nThanks for even reading. I hope to contribute myself now!\n\n [‹ cheap knock-off or the same thing?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423050958/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27302 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fave Typefaces from 1930-1950s: Display ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423050958/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21421 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
