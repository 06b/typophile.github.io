If one wants a decorative face with lots of swashes, and there are places where such a thing could be used tastefully, why not start from a good typeface as a basis?\n\n"

Why not add swashes?\"\n\nMaking a new typeface or adding swashes to a lesser known typeface requires more work in marketing. I don't think anyone is adding swashes to any typeface to improve the design, but rather to ride on the success of its name. Why else would Helvetica Flair exist? Certainly not because it's exactly what we were looking for or because it has so much potential.\n\n"

I don't consider it to be a good practice to attach swashes to typefaces that weren't intended to have swashes. If this typeface was intended to have swashes, I think it would have been planned for the swashes better.\n\nBut also, I think the swashes itself in this case are often just not well designed. I find the swash on /y to be horrible, and I would love to modify the swashes in /a and /e as well. I feel the swashes are very much an afterthought, rather than part of the design of the typeface.\n\n"
