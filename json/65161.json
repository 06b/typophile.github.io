I need help ID'ing the font for the logo of Libbie Wicket.\n\n[www.libbiewicket.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202141828/http:/www.libbiewicket.com/ \"www.libbiewicket.com\")\n\nI'm so in love with this font - but I can't seem to find it anywhere! Also the font for the other part of the logo would be fantastic as well (normal serif type) and the calligraphy type as well.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n[http://www.luxecetera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc\\_0301.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202141828/http:/www.luxecetera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0301.jpg \"http://www.luxecetera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc\\_0301.jpg\")  \n [http://www.luxecetera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc\\_0275.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202141828/http:/www.luxecetera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0275.jpg \"http://www.luxecetera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc\\_0275.jpg\")\n\n",
