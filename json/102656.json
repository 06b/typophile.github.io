      "content": "Thanks for the comments! All appreciated.  \nThis font was designed with some uses in mind: book jackets, posters, stylish magazines,  \nand eventually, other uses that most of our library doesn't offer.  \nRegarding the layered system we didn't what to copy ourselves, because I've done that with Braga and recently with Prumo Poster, and also because it was a constrain that we didn't wanted the font to deal with.  \nThe main issue with this font is: how it's possible to kern between stylistic sets (and we did that for 9 ss)?\n\nBest,  \nDino dos Santos  \nDSType\n\n"
