  "content": "So a lot of people can tell you the optimum line length for reading text is, 63 to 72 characters.\n\nWe know this is not a 'fixed' number for all readers and all compositions, but is this a fixed value for all fonts?\n\nNo... clearly it refers only to text faces.\n\nWhat's a text face?\n\nGood question! Let's assume it is a face that is in a particular range, numerically, in its relationship between primary stem thickness, and alphabet length-to-cap height, (or l.c. ht. to alphabet length)\n\nNow, can one assume all faces fitting into that mathematical description of 'text' are good at 63-72 characters per line?\n\nPerhaps... but then what are the best line lengths for non-text faces, if there is such a length-per-design?\n\n_Is that one number of characters per line actually hiding a continuum waiting to be applied to all alphabets?_\n\nNow I'm tired of talking to myself, does anyone know of any studies, theories or ideas of their own? :-)\n\nCheers!\n\n",

A line of Industria all caps of 70 characters is going to be much harder to read than one in Times. I suspect that leading can also extend the potential length of a line ... if you have additional leading equal to the typesize, as opposed to something set solid.\n\nUnfortunately, these are just guesses, and not substantiated by any studies (that I know of).\n\n"

      "content": "Just to chime in back on the line length thoughts...\n\nI've often thought that it makes sense to think of the fundamental measurement unit of type as THE SACCADE instead of fixed measurements like pica. The reason is that the saccade is the fundamental unit of READING.\n\nAcademics have pretty much put to rest the debate about letterwise versus wordshape recognition, in favor of the composite \"parallel processing\" model. But, the saccade is still the primary unit of visual apprehension of type, regardless of how it is visually processed.\n\nNow, obviously, this isn't a precise measuring system in the sense that every reader's saccade is of different physical size, with more practiced and trained readers being able to acquire a larger saccade at higher speeds. But on the other hand, it is a very practical MINDSET since it: (1) orients the text designer to the service of reading rather than abstract & formalist aesthetics, (2) demands visual logic and reader testing to rule type decisions instead of math, (3) accounts for differences in setting various languages due to word lengths, (4) differentiates among text categories (dense hard sciences texts filled with formulas & numbers versus breezy magazine editorials) by bringing intended reading speed into the foreground of criteria.\n\nSo to get back to the line length questions, perhaps we shouldn't really ever worry or care about character counts per line as rules-of-thumb, but instead think in terms of how many saccades per line are appropriate for the text and reading experience in question. It's a reductive system, yes, but also quite practical and fast in terms of gut reaction to a text setting. The number of saccades taken per line is always a round whole number (your eye can't jump a fraction of a saccade...it either does or doesn't).\n\nAs a side note, I've often thought it would be an interesting experiment to design a typeface based on a standard workhorse that adds a small red dot just above the x-height on each line as \"fixation points\" for the intended saccades based on reading speed (kind of like a karaoke dot) for training / diagnostic testing purposes to the end of employing this kind of thinking among designers & students....\n\n"

      "content": "Are you asking about reading comprehension, or pleasure. And as I say this, I realize the two are not unrelated. That's a theory, of course. Moreover, I believe (more theory) that the content of the text also plays a role in optimum line length, for both ease of comprehension and aesthetics.\n\nAt some level, I come back to the notion that if all these things could be quantified, we could come up with a computer program to specify them. While eliminating a need for graphic designers is an intriguing notion -- with it's own pleasure component -- I suspect we're not going to get there.\n\nOn thing I have noticed: most texts will set better with some \"number of characters\" or equivalent value, and that value changes with the text.\n\nFor example, when we used TeX for book composition and I was designing, it was easy to change the type size, measure, spaceband values, whatever, and run the whole book. TeX could be set up to write off to a separate file the number of lines that did not fit within the values affecting the horizontal space you'd selected (overfull hbox). Of course, this includes spaceband values as well as measure and type size.\n\nGrep \"overfull\" in that file, pipe it to another file, and the number of lines in that file would be the number of lines which would not set within the given parameters. The whole deal took less than five minutes; changing a parameter, running the book, grepping the overfull hboxes & taking a look.\n\nHere is the interesting part: Within reason, the values that gave the best mechanical setting (fewest overfull hboxes) were usually the values that made the text the most comfortable to read. Nor was this always the smallest type/longest measure, given the obvious restriction that (1) you just wouldn't go larger or smaller than a certain type size, (or essentially the equivalent, longer/shorter than a certain measure), and (2) you shouldn't change the spaceband values much.\n\nWith these restrictions, the technique amounts to tweaking rather than designing per se, but it was interesting how often it proved useful, and for me, showed that the text itself is a factor in choosing certain parameters.\n\nSadly, AFAIK, you can't set up InDesign to give such a report; in effect, it always has \"emergency stretch\" turned on.\n\n"

It's only hard if you try to say the value you give to a single parameter must \"design to a specific aesthetic\" of a display type, or to \"design to a specific comprehension level\" as a text type, much less design for a specific aesthetic as a text type, or the most obscure which is to design for a very particular comprehension in display type.\n\nThese things are beyond the scope of this, particularly when applied to web type.

We talked about line length, leading, type size (nominal and visual), word space, and all the other factors noted above. I learned from them how to make simple layouts and set the type in metal. Many years later decided I could try to design books.\n\nIn the interim I read some of those reading studies (with my eyelids propped open by toothpicks and good shot of No-Doze).
