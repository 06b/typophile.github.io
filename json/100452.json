  "content": "Hi,\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for a sans serif typeface to use on a business card to use with Mishka ( [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/mishka/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819201154/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/mishka/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/mishka/\")) I used Mishka for the logo. It's for a fictional Odwalla/Naked-esque juice brand and the person we are designing the card for is the founder, who is a doctor.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
