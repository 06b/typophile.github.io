This is an early port I made to the Mac several months ago to see how it looks on screen- The actual font is being designed on my Palm Vx, and I can already notice changes from this specimen.   \n   \nHow small can you go and maintain legibility? By allowing the ascenders and descenders to define the word shape, the 4px x-height is surprisingly readable.

In my current design (my first Latin text face, I admit) I have the exclamation higher than the question mark (even though the reversed Spanish ones have the same span/location).   \n   \nIt's tempting to align the excalamation (and question) marks with the UC and/or ascender height, but in actual text setting, where does the mark usually end up? After a string of mostly x-height glyphs. In text setting apparent size is much more important than alignment (which I feel is generally a very superficial merit in a text face). Since the question mark has a much stronger top than the exclamation, it only makes sense for the latter to go taller.   \n   \nNote: Thanks to OpenType you can now make exclamation marks of varying height, and specify which one to use when.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

But: This does not mean I doubt the value of interlinear space - it's crucial for guiding saccades.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Although Majoor's wonderful Seria Italics is a killer exception:   \n [http://www.fontfont.de/packages/seria11178/serita29960/serita29960\\_xx.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414080150/http:/www.fontfont.de/packages/seria11178/serita29960/serita29960_xx.html)   \nBTW, is it true that Seria has a \\*second\\* italics, somewhere?   \n   \nBut functionally, italics is about emphasis, and in this case slanting would only emphasize why slanting on-screen is a bad idea...   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I have exceptionally good eyesight, something like 40-20, (or should that be 20-40?), and I have difficulty with it on screen. I think that has nothing to do with the traditional reasons that a font is not legible, but to do with the normal tendency of the brain to seek out familiar pattern - and the fact that at this size that just isn't happening. At least not for my brain! The type is so small that a kind of anti-anti-aliasing seems to taking effect.\n\n"

Maybe 40/20 is [somewhat] like saying 20/10, which is actually suspiciously exceptional! :-)   \n   \nHere's something via Google:   \n [http://www.milfordeye.com/vtest.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414080150/http:/www.milfordeye.com/vtest.htm)   \n   \nBut note that those numbers refer to \\*feet\\*, and people have very different ranges. My range for example is extremely close: freeway signs are a little blurry to me, but during my eye test I undershot the equipment's minimum range! Probably from using computers for 23+ years now... Or maybe it was painting D&D miniatures by candle-light: the bombs would cut our electricity... :-/   \n   \nBack to the font:   \nOn the other hand, I think you're right that the font is too small for any normal definition of \"comfort\". But I also think that sometimes space is expensive enough to warrant using it (like the things Joe mentioned). It's a niche thing, which \\*does\\* make it valuable.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

But the clogging in \"e\" and \"g\" (and in \"a\", \"s\" and \"z\" to a lesser extent) is a problem.   \n   \nEven in a 4pix x-height there are ways to avoid clogging, although it leads to some unconventional forms. For example, a 4pix bicameral \"a\" is one where the bottom row of a conventional 5-pix bicameral \"a\" is dumped (and the same could be done for the \"e\", but at the top). For the \"g\", I'd go with the Koch form (again).   \n   \nIt's tempting to fall back on mono forms for \"a\" and \"g\", but the bi forms are what would make Benson Linear unique, and I'm glad to see you going for them.   \n   \nAs for the caps, I think there are some legibility issues (like the \"B\").
