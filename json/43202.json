      "content": "I think this may be a mix, with initials from a different font than the other letters. The more I look at it, the more I believe that this is handlettered, because the identical letters don’t appear to be identically formed. It seems based on something like [Uncia](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202133542/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/uncia/). This is for the majority of the letters. The initials are strange, almost more like Blackletter initials, although the G in Glass doesn’t look familiar at all.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
