Or is it only possible to completely recreate the font in curves and generate a new one?\n\n [‹ InDesign CS and font weirdness!!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905083231/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38619 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [FontLab Interface Peeves (2) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905083231/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44454 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
