I just put it in here in dark grey so that you're unbiased in terms of colours\n\nI'd also like to add a wordmark but i've got no idea which font would fit.. I've tried a few already but none seemed to work\n\ncheers, mike\n\n"

Fake words for fake business models. ;0)\n\nIf you like blue, and seven, why not simplify it to something like:\n\nblooseven  \nblu7  \nblue7\n\netc.\n\nAdded bonus is that 'blue seven' has an obvious logo solution. ;o)\n\n-Darrel\n\n"

On the name it has an onomatopoeic quality, a kind of rounded sound, I think that it might require more rounded forms, maybe you could emphasise roundness of the corners.  \nTim\n\n"

I've played around with very minimalistic shapes of a b and the number 7 and this is what came out..  \nAt the top you can see the idea behind the logo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130315120611im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bloob_new_5699.jpg)\n\npersonally, I'm pretty satisfied (for the moment) because it's a much more energetic and dynamic piece which fits me better than the Uber-serious look from before because I'm only 22  \nPersonally I like A) the best.. It has got a touch of blue (bloo) and symbolizes an idea and/or graphic solution that just popped into my mind but the whole could also stand for a (design) factory with the blue part being the top of a chimney.\n\nany comments?!  \nI'm also looking for an accompanying font.. any ideas?\n\ncheers mike\n\n"
