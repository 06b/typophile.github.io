  "content": "Dear Type Lovers and Researchers:\n\nAs part of my senior thesis work I am making a flash video about the history of Futura, complete with a discussion of the Bauhaus movement, a healthy dose of the font’s integration of geometric forms, and its use in Nazi propaganda. I have photos to fit my every need in the project, except for one: a pic of the Bauer type foundry where it was commissioned. I have done extensive research on the internet, to no avail. Does anyone here know where I could find one (or would be willing to post their pic)? Any help is much appreciated - AND I’ll be willing to throw in an amazing, limited-time offer: a viewing of the finished video, online :P.\n\nThanks and cheerio  \nbeatleblaker\n\n [‹ Book recommendations: Python for Fontlab](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929161016/http:/typophile.com/node/49944 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Bridge Type ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929161016/http:/typophile.com/node/49951 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
