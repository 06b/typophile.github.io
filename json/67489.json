  "content": "I am proud to finally announce the release of Otari. It can be purchased at [TK Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012222952/http:/www.tktype.com/) or [myfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012222952/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/tk-type/otari/). A version of the bold weight, with a limited character set, is also available for free on either site.\n\nOtari is vibrant and contemporary, but serious and built to last.\n\nIts character shines in display type, but doesn’t interfere at text sizes. Otari aims to capture the essence of Wellington, New Zealand in a single typeface. The contrast of a colorful art scene and the conservative colonial British aesthetic, which is still evident in the capital city, laid the groundwork for this design.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012222952im_/http:/typophile.com/files/otari1_5110.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012222952im_/http:/typophile.com/files/otari3_4765.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012222952im_/http:/typophile.com/files/otari2_6380.png)\n\n[TK Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012222952/http:/www.tktype.com/)  \n [myfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012222952/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/tk-type/otari/)\n\n[PDF Specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012222952/http:/www.tktype.com/Otari.pdf)\n\n",
