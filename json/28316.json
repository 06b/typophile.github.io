  "content": "Hello,\n\nIn the the last days I'm working in a new design. The inspiration is in the aesthetics of machines an in the geometric typefaces used in CAD softwares. In the project I tried a friendly-eye approach through proportions, spacing (no manospaced) and optic adjustments in the weight of the lines.\n\n[http://www.rafaelneder.com/discord/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414193332/http:/www.rafaelneder.com/discord/ \"http://www.rafaelneder.com/discord/\")\n\nPlease tell me what you guys think\n\n",

To fix I need to work in the junction of the vertical and diagonal strokes. And futher apply on /N\n\nThe the crossbar on the numbers 5/6/9 must go down (something like /8 or /H\n\n"

In the past weeks I fix some drawings on several glyphs and change some proportions.\n\nTo the family I'm planning some ligatures and alternates but this is my first OpenType adventure and I'm having a lot of pain in the generation of the font files but i will fix it soon.

My guess is that the bottom of 'b' 'e' and 'd' are hinted and the h' 'i' and 'n' aren't. The metrics of 'f' and 'r' leave a big white area and the metrics of 't' and 'l' are too small. A good example is the word 'software'.  \nAnother thing, your diacritics seem a little out of place, like the Â, Ô, Û, and the ~ looks to wide for the lowercase letters.\n\nEmiliano Amadei\n\n"

The arm are to big and the negative space blow up.\n\n"

      "content": "Could you post a new pdf of what you have now?  \nWhat i was saying about the baseline is that when a letter like your 'i' 'h' and 'r' that begins with a vertical stroke and no support at the base, it tends, when rendered, to look smaller and bolder when compared to a complex form ghyph like 's' or 'a'. With a little hinting you can solve this problem.\n\nEmiliano Amadei\n\n"
