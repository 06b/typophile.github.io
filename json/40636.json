  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m in the process of designing a student newspaper (Studentbladet [www.stbl.fi](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060221/http:/www.stbl.fi/ \"www.stbl.fi\")). It’s about 20 pages in size. Size of the paper is A3 roughly.\n\nNow I’m looking for header and body text fonts. I’m thinking about useing four diffrent fonts, two sans-serif for header and body text, two sans for smaller column headers and text.\n\nYou can find last years editions in PDF files here [http://www.stbl.fi/tidning/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060221/http:/www.stbl.fi/tidning/ \"http://www.stbl.fi/tidning/\"). I’m going to redo pretty much everything since I and the rest of the new staff don’t agree with the current layout.\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated since I’m new to designing a newspaper. Specially type, suggestions on good readable sans and sans-serifs for print.\n\npeter\n\n [‹ plus](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060221/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40714 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tarzana Wide Bold Italic alternatives ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060221/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40666 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I think if your paper is North American, you really should look at a serif face for the text. Very few newspapers here use sans for text. I would also be very careful about mixing different text faces. You are better to keep to one family for the text weights. It would be acceptable to find a pair of complementary sans families for heading applications.\n\n"

I’m also considering a third font for vignettes to certain articles that always occur in the paper with some added graphic elements.\n\nRight now I’m leaning towards Caslon or maybe Jenson.\n\n"

Low x-height will also be tough to handle well in smaller point sizes. I would like to see a sample design if you have time to post.\n\nYou might slug in some [Lido](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060221/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/free.php) for reference if the Caslon and Jenson are not working like you would want.\n\n"
