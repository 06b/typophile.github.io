The consensus seems to be that Glaser used American Typewriter Bold - a \"no-brainer.\" But the version on Milton Glaser's web site:   \n [http://www.miltonglaser.com/projects/logos.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20111016053802/http:/www.miltonglaser.com/projects/logos.html)   \nas well as every version I have ever seen, is slightly different. ITC American Typewriter has a lot more color than Glaser's version.   \n   \nAny ideas?\n\n",
