To my uneducated eye, the most distinctive feature is that the lower-case s appears to have a round top but a flat bottom. Unfortunately there are no uppercase letters or numerals in my sample.\n\n",

It's obviously a geometric sans, similar to [Avant-Garde Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724130507/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/avant+garde) or [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724130507/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/futura). Feels \"freebie\" too. Some you might like: [Century Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724130507/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-gothic), [Champagne & Limousines](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724130507/http:/www.dafont.com/champagne-limousines.font), **[Geo Sans Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724130507/http:/www.dafont.com/geo-sans-light.font)** (possibly matching). Actually, many freebies that you could find [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724130507/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501)) would do the job.\n\n"
