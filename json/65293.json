  "content": "Anyone up for an impromptu battle of Type ID skills?\n\nI've been digging through our archives, and found these (gasp!) zero-response posts from January 2009 that never got solved. I'm teeing them up for you Type IDers who love a good mystery.\n\nIf you solve them, respond on the respective thread and let us know back here if you've closed it out. Can we get them all?\n\nWe'll track the results (who solved it, and how fast) and post a scoreboard here as they're solved. The timer starts as of this posting.\n\nReady.. Set..
