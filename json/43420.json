The \"more\" issues can wait, but I feel compelled to point out that the user can modify the kerning, one instance at a time, in most any layout program making any pretensions to \"setting type.\"\n\nThe point of having kerning in the font is so the compositors do not have to repeat their work every time a certain letter/symbol sequence occurs, for the bulk of material to be set (i.e., text).\n\nI have been kerning type for over 20 years, and still cannot get things right on my first attempt. I use \"first attempt\" to cover several passes and laser printouts. I find I have to see the type as it appears in the final printed form, more than once, and revisit the kerning several times after seeing ink on paper.\n\nWhile some may argue that I am just inordinately slow in arriving at passable kerning, I disagree. Moreover, I rather doubt that any foundry can get the kerning right before releasing a font. Nor would most of us typesetters expect that. In the photocomp days, it was expected that the type shop would make up their own kerning tables. One of the many things I admire about Matthew Carter is that he both understands and acknowledges the difference between type designers and type users.\n\nSince the typesetter can change the kerning one instance at a time, and can made up any accented character out of the several glyphs in the font, it make no sense to prohibit them from making these changes permanently, in the font itself.\n\nI agree font licenses are necessary. But in their present constitution, they make the product virtually unusable for a significant segment of type users. I don't have all that much influence in my sector of the market, but when asked, I always recommend against a designer using a font from a foundry where the license prohibits a use we all know is likely to occur.\n\nThis is a forum frequented more by type designers than by type users. But consider this: with rare exceptions, we do not frame & hang a font specimen sheet in a museum. If the licenses stray too far from the conventions of using type, both the type designers and the type users are in trouble.\n\nCharles Ellertson\n\nNote: I made an edit; this post may have originally been made before Chris's post.\n\n"

This clearly separates data as provided by the originator of the file, and the modifications.\n\nWhat would be really great were something like Adobe's SING Glyphlet. This one however would not hold outlines, but GPOS/GSUB tables with features, to be used instead of same-named features present in the font, or as additional features if not present in the font. This would also hold some metadata taken from the font it refers to, especially names and version, since the glyphset and thus GIDs to which OT layout tables refer may change as fonts get updated.  \nThe advantage: It is not bound to any particular application. The real challenge would be to establish something like a standard which then would be adopted by OS and application developers. Hello Thomas!\n\nCan Glyphlets provide _substitutes_ for this or that glyph of a specific OT font (rather than additional ones)? This would make it much easier for designers to do adjustments to fonts for individual projects -- without need to mess around with fonts.  \nMaybe a Glyphlet's metadata could even name a Stylistic Set feature by which one Glyphlet file's glyphs are applied. Or allow specifying an alternative font name, so font + Glyphlet's alternate glyphs are regarded and presented as a separate font/style in the font/style menus.\n\nKarsten\n\n"

This wasn't the case with many T1 fonts whose PS file and suitcase often had very different file names. So, only advantages.&nbsp;&nbsp;:D  \nNot to forget -- an additional file is better that setting up kerning tables in a layout application (XPress) which are then bound to this application, and if you migrate from one computer to another you better don't forget the according files ...

Font developers/foundries need to be protected from theft, be that stealing a font for resale under another name, or simply not purchasing enough copies for the computers being used.\n\nI believe that the \"no modifications\" rule was aimed at preventing the first; that is, just doing a little work on the font & then reselling it. But that is absurd; just ban the the reselling of the font, or any \\*derivatives\\* from it (if that's the right word).\n\nThere is also the question of damaging the font maker's reputation by some truly awful kerning or glyph modification. But these can be done in the applications program, too. Sadly, anybody can destroy the look of a font right now, without breaking the EULA.\n\nI look at the kerning that comes with a font as an extension of getting the sidebearings right. It isn't the final solution, it is just a nice starting point for good character fit. A typesetter can use use it. But a compositor (who is also a typographer) can take over and add what makes the fonts work for him/her.\n\n"

(everybody! make up names!)_\n\nThere's an unfortunate tendency to chastise the people responsible for character encoding standards for not understanding how typographers look at text, when that is not their task or responsibility. One might as well chastise typographers for not understanding how encoded character sets work.\n\nUnicode is a plain text encoding, which means that -- with idiosyncrasies and exceptions to accomodate conflicting principles of inclusion, e.g. backwards compatibility with pre-existing standards, which is in part responsible for the proliferation of script-specific numerals (European, Arabic, Persian, Devanagari, etc.) -- Unicode seeks to encode whatever is necessary to preserve the semantic content of text, _not_ everything necessary to its display. The display of text is something that happens, as they say, at a higher level, for which the text encoding provides a foundation _as one of the many functions that the text encoding must serve,_ i.e. it is a mistake to assume, just because we are typographers, that the providing for the correct typographic display of text is the principle or even one of the most important purposes of a character encoding standard.\n\nNow, the distinction of case in our bicameral orthographies frequently carries a semantic distinction, for instance in the capitalisation of proper nouns in English and, more dramatically, in the capitalisation of all nouns in German. That is semantic information that should not be lost in a plain text encoding; ergo, the upper and lowercase letters are separately encoded even though in many other ways they are functionally identical, notably in representing the same phonemes (from which it should be obvious that case distinction is more semantically meaningful for displaying text than it is for voice synthesis). We can summarise this by saying that Latin alphabetic letters are orthographically bicameral.\n\nNumerals, on the other hand, are not only not orthographically bicameral they are not alphabetic. All numerals are ideographic: they do not represent sounds, they represent quantitative and combinatory concepts. There is never any semantic distinction between a cap-lining numeral 2 and an 'oldstyle' numeral 2: they always represent the same semantic content, and ergo there is no need to preserve a merely visual distinction between then _in plain text._ There are many good reasons why one would want to preserve a visual distinction in various kinds of typeset text, but that is quite rightly considered a display issue, not an encoding issue.\n\nSo the questions regarding how font developers, application developers and users might conspire to select appropriate styles of numerals for specific documents, and for specific uses within those documents, are all questions of layout feature mapping and user interface. The situation, for developers and users, is far from perfect -- see the complaints I have made in the past regarding Adobe's OT numerals style selection model, which precludes having anything other than oldstyle or lining numerals as the default style (no three-quarter height or hybrid numerals, for example) because there is no way to access the proportional or tabular spacing features independently of style selection. But no part of this problem is due to Unicode's sensible encoding of a single set of European numerals on the basis of their semantic content.\n\n"

This isn't a negotiable position or an opinion, it is a necessary feature of a text encoding that sets out to do what Unicode sets out to do. And I just spent several paragraphs explaining why the decision to encode a single set of European numerals based on their semantic value and not on their appearance does _not_ have an impact on typography: what has an impact on typography is what is built on top of that semantic foundation, which is display, which is not plain text, which is text layout services, which is fonts, and which is ultimately a user interface issue.\n\nAnd again: _it is a mistake to assume, just because we are typographers, that the providing for the correct typographic display of text is the principle or even one of the most important purposes of a character encoding standard._ The majority of what gets done with the majority of digitally encoded text involves operations in invisibility, i.e. the text isn't displayed at all. How much of the billions of 'pages' of text indexed by Google ever gets displayed? How often? To how many people? That's just one example of something that requires immense material and processing resources that is completely text-centric and yet only comparatively rarely involves display when, or if, someone wants to search for and read a particular piece of text. And that processing is a heck of a lot easier if one doesn't have dozens of encoded variants with the same semantic value.

There are, sometimes, more than one way to skin the plain text cat, but I'm not sure any of them 'accomodate the semantic structure of typography' better than another. Why? Because the semantic structure of typography is hugely variable, much of typography isn't semantic at all but aesthetic, and it isn't easy to disentangle the semantic and the aesthetic in typography. Can you give me an example, for instance, of a situation in which the distinction between lining numerals and oldstyle numerals is properly semantic, i.e. where a _different meaning_ is implied? Your phrase 'semantic structure' suggests something like a grammar, but while there are multiple articulatory and organisational conventions observed within typography, I'm not sure that there is anything that functions quite like a grammar. Further, I don't think what is typically signaled in those conventions is semantics, properly understood. For example, consider the use of a different size and style or weight of type to signal a subhead in a document. This is an organisational convention, specific to the document but also part of a broader set of conventions for signaling subheads that has developed within a particular tradition of publication design. [Note also that the concept of a subhead is not typographic, it is editorial; it is only signaled typographically.] The typographic treatment of the subhead helps to visually articulate the structure of the document. It tells the reader that this piece of text is a different kind of information. And this is an important job. But it doesn't actually affect the _meaning_ of the text, so I'm not inclined to call it semantics. The idea of articulation is, once again, helpful. When we speak, how we speak helps a listener to understand our meaning, but this is extra-semantic in a linguistic sense. A tone of voice might indicate that we are being ironic, and that what we mean is actually the opposite of the words we are saying; but that irony itself is resting on top of the actual semantics of those words and their organisation: the semantics belong to the words, not to how we say them. We can play off the semantics verbally or visually, in speech or typography, but only _because_ the semantics are independent of that play.\n\n"

Here are some examples of the way that linguists and programmers have advanced typography, but failed to meet the more discriminating needs of typographers, privileging their own conception of what is necessary in text--\n\n1) ASCII encoding: plenty of mathematic symbols, but no \"curly quotes\" or fi and fl ligatures.\n\n2) The 4-member font family: this defines a bicameral concept of typographic weight that continues to plague foundries developing multi-weight families for cross-platform use. It restricts typographic design in the broad arena: a contemporary sans serif like Verdana should have had Thin, Light, and Extra Bold weights. With an incremental range of weights, modernist layout is possible, but this has been severely discouraged on the internet. Even today, the ClearType fonts offer users (both typographers and readers) bicameral weighting, not range weighting. This is one hundred years after the introduction of multi-weight type families, and fifty years after the famous Univers chart, and after 20 years of making digital typography, Microsoft still hasn't caught up and offered users this basic feature of modern typography.\n\n3) Separate Unicode numbers for upper and lower case letters. By coding both, things have been made extremely complicated for font and application developers, and typographers. Small capitals, unicase, figure styles, superiors and inferiors--all these typographically meaningful features of sophisticated typography are awkward to twist one's head around when there are separate encodings for upper and lower case letters. The result is different implementations between different layout applications, and from different foundries, which doesn't help advancing the cause.\n\n4) Looking to the future, I suspect that any standards that are adopted for downloadable web fonts will have similar difficulties.\n\n"

But the business of providing that display is necessarily something that has to happen above the plain text level, i.e. display should be kept as much out of the character encoding as possible (but not any further out). And I'm not just saying that for the benefit of character encoding and text processing: I'm saying it for the sake of display too. It's a church and state matter: the separation is intended to be mutually beneficial, not to protect one from the other.\n\n_So, no matter how Unicode does “what Unicode set out to do”, it has encoded uppercase and lowercase alphabets, not upper and lowercase figures, and driven a wedge into typography that confounds users enough_\n\nWhile I agree with the analysis of 'oldstyle' numerals as being, structurally, akin to lowercase letters, I don't recall ever having seen them referred to as 'lowercase numerals' in any book on typography. I don't think this is a wedge that Unicode has delivered -- in any case, the unitary encoding of numerals is something that predates Unicode by a long time --; I think different numeral styles have been poorly analysed for a long time, and poorly analysed by most typographers.\n\nBut it seems very obvious to me that there are two perfectly legitimate ways in which to analyse numeral styles, one in which their visual distinctiveness is considered significant, and one in which their semantic lack of distinctiveness is considered significant. Not surprisingly, in the context of plain text encoding, the lack of semantic distinction is the more significant feature, because plain text encoding is concerned with semantics.\n\n"

Everything about every expression of language probably has some semanticity to it, if only for the fact of not having chosen alternative possibilities. But I think there's a sense in which it's fair to say that the difference between \"a\" and \"b\" has more semanticity than the difference between \"a\" and \"A\", which has more semanticity than the difference between \"a\" and _\"a\"_, which in turn has more semanticity than the difference between a Fournier \"a\" and a Garamond \"a\". The Unicode people have chosen to draw the line after the first two in the case of bicameral alphabets. One can debate whether that was the right place to draw the line - a strong case could be made that capitalization is a stylistic feature whose semanticity is additive rather than fundamental to the text - but obviously a line has to be drawn somewhere for practical purposes.\n\nIt does make things look more frustrating, though, when the standard isn't internally consistent in applying its own rules. A lot of Unicode's shortcomings exist because it really has two different, partially incompatible, purposes. It isn't just a plaintext encoding system for all languages; it's also intended to unify all the pre-existing encoding standards (and be congruent with ISO 10646). As a result, lots of things are in it that shouldn't be according to its own criteria, because somebody had encoded them already - like the fi and fl ligatures. I suppose the prevailing attitude of trying to do the least damage by prioritizing backwards compatibility above adherence to rules is sensible, but it does confuse people who think their ligatures - or whatever other presentational form that didn't make the cutoff - ought to be encoded too.\n\n"

Sure, we always said, \"old style figures are like lower case, with ascenders and descenders,\" but that didn't mean we conceived of lining figures as upper case. The impediment was type technologies which more often than not had lower case letters married to lining numbers, as default. And in the early days of DTP, with SC&osf, it was even stranger, as if old-style figures were primarily part of the small cap case. So we are making progress towards a more \"proper\" semantics of typography.\n\nOf course, there are ways other than character encoding to assign case to numerals.\n\n"

Would 5 suddenly stop meaning five? Would 5+5 equal something other than 10? Of course it wouldn't.\n\nFurther, even if one applies a metaphorical use of 'semantics' to include this kind of associative judgement, i.e. if one calls this a kind of 'meaning', there is still nothing there that would be a proper subject for a plain text character encoding, since that kind of 'meaning' is not the kind of meaning that needs to be preserved in plain text; indeed, it is the kind of 'meaning' that presumes styled text.

Now the question of positive or negative numbers is an interesting one, since 5 is indeed semantically different from -5, so if you represent -5 as 5 in some particular styling, e.g. **_5_** , to distinguish it from 5, then you are indeed using style to indicate a semantic difference. _And it is a very dangerous thing to do._ You better hope that whoever is preparing documents in which negative numbers are presented as positive numbers only in red is working from a source text in which either those negative numbers are encoded as e.g. -5 or are in some way tagged as negative numbers. And you better hope than no one who needs to cite that document is cutting and pasting from an electronic version in which the plain text distinction between 5 and -5 has been lost.\n\nUsing numeral style to indicate such a semantic difference is much more ambiguous than using colour or other stylings, though.
