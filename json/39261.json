      "content": "A freestanding caron isn’t part of any phonetic transcription system I’m aware of—what is it supposed to mean? Assuming you are using the International Phonetic Alphabet (since the other symbols are IPA symbols), if the caron is supposed to represent primary stress (my guess), you should use Unicode 02C8 (modifier letter vertical line: [ˈnajs]) instead. If the caron is supposed to represent rising intonation (as in, “Nice?”), it belongs over the ’a’: [nǎjs].\n\nOtherwise I like the logo. I like the Aktiebolag, but it could be interesting to see an AB version too. And I like the colors; will the orange look very different in print than on screen?\n\nLycka till med logotypen!\n\n"
