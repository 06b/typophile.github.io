      "content": "The image seems to be from one of the original posters for the movie, which was released in 1984.  \nI suspect it is lettering adapted from a monoline slab serif font such as Rockford. The oversize bowl on the R and the ski jump leg could have been added to evoke a nostalgic retro/deco mood.  \nAt least I have not seen the combination in a digital or pre-digital monoline slab serif font.  \nThere is at least one digital font inspired by Rockford that has a ski jump leg on the R similar to the lettering:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123045257im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1984LetteringAndSanchezSlabWithAltR_3715.jpg)\n  \nThe lettering is in red and the font in black.  \nIt's [Sanchez Slab](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123045257/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/sanchez-slab/), using the alt R.  \nDon \n"

X-height looks closer to your original sample, only needs /R leg to be tweaked.\n\n"
