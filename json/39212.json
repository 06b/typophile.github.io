I thought of House’s Neutraface, but if you don’t want to make that kind of investment, you could work with [Neuzeit Grotesk (Geometric 706)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203171212/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-706/) and use a small amount of added white stroke to thin the strokes like your sample.\n\nThis is assuming you only want to do a limited amount of lettering this way.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
