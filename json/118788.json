Té Rowan's earlier remark is applicable. Readable, edgy, stylish, psychedelic, other? 5. What is a lyric sheet, in this context? Is it one sheet of paper? Stapled big or little sheets of paper? Something on the internet? A little booklet for a CD package? Is the logo going to be close to the lyrics? 6. What do other lyric sheets use?\n\n"

So, in order to create a suitably mysterious effect, designers made these really hard to read by printing them in weird shit colours—with complementary simultaneous contrast, for instance, or in different colors with similar tones, such as cyan on black.\n\nThe lyrics of Sgt. Pepper, for instance, were printed in Times Roman (IIRC) black on red, also surprinting an inset close-cropped photo of the Beatles in colorful pseudo-antique military uniforms.\n\n"
