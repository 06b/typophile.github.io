  "content": " **Hello,**\n\nas promised in 'Greek type question 1' I return, this time with two slightly different versions of ναρκόω.  \nIn the example shown You'll see my type – Orla – in regular first, then _GFS Olga_ and _Gentium_ in grey. Below them are Orla italic with my attempts at an italic greek version.\n\nPlease share Your opinions and show no mercy.\n\nThanks,\n\nƒ\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417082858im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Orla_grek_5283.png)\n\n",
