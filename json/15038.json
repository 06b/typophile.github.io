I only saw a few screens of the work, but the stuff is amazing and suprisingly, i hadnt heard a lot about the work he did with the magazine. I always heard Ray Gun this and that but not so much about BC…So i was wondering if anyone had some good links to screens of pages or to places you can find actual copies? i’ve really never seen this magazine anywhere and the usual ebay search didnt turn up anything. So before i email D. Carson himself, i thought i’d ask here. thanks\n\nw|m\n\n",
