The NicePrice Font Collection and Font Deal of the Day program target home users, scrapbook enthusiasts, arts and crafts aficionados, school teachers, students, church volunteers, non-professional designers, small businesses and individuals seeking high-quality, low-cost fonts to meet any typographic need.\n\nThe NicePrice Font Collection comprises 150 font products, including a wide variety of image fonts, creative display faces and text fonts, with selections ranging from single fonts and typeface families to the Scrapbook Value Pack, with five faces geared for the scrapbook enthusiast. All selections are available as single user licenses, with prices starting at $4.99 for individual fonts. The Font Deal of the Day features one font offered at an 80 percent discount for 24 hours. Available Monday through Friday, the Font Deal of the Day is posted at 10 a.m. eastern time, replacing the previous day’s deal. Font Deal of the Day faces are sourced from the Monotype®, Linotype® and ITC® typeface collections.\n\n“Our NicePrice selection is all about typefaces that add fun and inspiration to a variety of projects, from club newsletters and school projects to scrapbooks and gift ideas,” said Allan Haley, director of words and letters at Monotype Imaging. “Our Font Deal of the Day program complements that spirit. We encourage customers to return to the Fonts.com homepage each weekday to see the latest deal. Through repeat visits, consumers will find they’ve built a unique collection of high-quality fonts while also saving a substantial amount of money.”\n\n“Every font adheres to our same quality standards that have been trusted for years by creative professionals worldwide,” said Chris Roberts, vice president of marketing at Monotype Imaging. “We’ve set ourselves apart from other low-cost fonts, which tend to pose a number of problems, including computer viruses that can exist within fonts, poor performance and quality, such as missing characters, and lack of customer support. We want customers to see us as an exceptional resource for high-quality fonts, as well as a place that offers straightforward, friendly help when needed.”\n\n",
