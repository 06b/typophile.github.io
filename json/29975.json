(Not strictly typography, but not quite Book Arts or Printing Arts.)\n\nAlso, perhaps a Magazines section listing currently published design magazines (_CA, Print,_ etc.)?\n\nTiff, I’m home now and am brimming over with stuff to compile & send you.

I hope you all don’t mind helping me.\n\n- I’d like to remove overlap. If you see books that are overlapped, please point them out to me. (I’ll look as well.) We’ll vote on where they belong for real.  \n- I do want to add Book Design and Calligraphy/Lettering is a good idea too.  \n- If you see a book in one section and feel it belongs elsewhere please tell me.  \n- Again, don’t be afraid to point out errors. For instance, I realize that all of the books attached to Robin Kinross have the wrong publisher. (This will be fixed immediately.)\n\nJason, you are a model citizen. Everyone please note how Jason sent me information to be added and follow in his noble footsteps.\n\nDesigning Type  \nby Karen Cheng  \nPublisher: Yale University Press; (April 3, 2006)  \nPaperback: 224 pages  \nISBN: 0300111509  \nPrice: $29.95 (list price)  \n [http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/sr=1-1/qid=1165538233/ref=pd\\_bbs\\_sr\\_1/002-2314699-9678433?ie=UTF8&s=books](http://web.archive.org/web/20070331124950/http:/www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/sr=1-1/qid=1165538233/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2314699-9678433?ie=UTF8&s=books)\n\nJason Dewinetz: While I’ve read a few comments both positive & negative on this book, as a reader with no formal training in type design I’ve found the book very useful towards a better understanding of how digital glyphs are put together, based one on another, etc. A well produced & finely illustrated publication.\n\nI realize there have been threads dedicated to horror of Amazon. Please consider that in this instance it is serving a very real and good purpose. When you purchase from Amazon you are doing a small part to support Typophile. So, consider if you are going to suggest a book please check to see if it is available on Amazon first. Then, if it isn’t please do give the link for the other site.\n\nThis could be a great resource for everyone looking for books. I hope you are all as enthusiastic about it and ready to participate! Go team!\n\n"
