It showcases the contents without being distracting or too noticeable.\n\nTypography is like the voice talent in an ad. You don't notice it when it's professional and appropriate, but when it's not, it just feels cheesy.\n\n",

Also you have different shoes for different purposes, and suiting the shoe to the outfit, etc. It is a surprisingly robust analogy.\n\n"
