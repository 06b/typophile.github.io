  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m just getting started on redesigning a university’s research and arts magazine. Wide variety of readers, from young adults to old folks. I want the new look to be contemporary, sophisticated, unique. We’ve been using mainly Janson and Univers since the magazine’s introduction about a decade ago.\n\nA few fonts that I’m taking a closer look at:\n\nSerifs: Whitman, Kingfisher  \nSans: Bliss, Apex new, Klavika\n\nWhatever sans we go with will need to be a fairly extensive family.\n\nAny suggestions on either serif or sans serifs? Or combinations?\n\nThanks!\n\nAlso, out of curiousity, does anyone know a ballpark figure for what custom faces cost? Probably out of our league, budget-wise, but I didn’t see any info on Hoefler’s site.\n\n [‹ new magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163542/http:/typophile.com/node/33381 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tibetian / Nepalese Style Font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163542/http:/typophile.com/node/33452 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

These should end up in their Retail library pretty soon. (I know a lot of people have been waiting patiently for these.) Corresponding small caps fonts are also in the works.\n\nIf you need more information sooner rather than later, you can contact Harry Parker at the Font Bureau.\n\nYou may also be interested to know that I’m in the final stages of the **Whitman Display** family, an expansion of some custom work that was done for the <cite>Tacoma News Tribune</cite> and <cite>Minneapolis Star Tribune</cite> newspapers a few years ago.\n\nHere are a few first-ever public previews:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163542im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WhitmDis_ShowingBeta_6550.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163542im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WhitmDisCond_ShowingBeta_5168.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163542im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WhitmDisComp_ShowingBeta_4447.gif)\n\nI can’t tell you the timing for eventual release; but if you’re interested, Harry could help you there as well.\n\nIncidently, Whitman and Bliss were introduced to each other in the <cite>Virginia Quarterly Review</cite> in late 2003, and from what I can tell, that marriage is still healthy and happy.\n\n— Kent.\n\n"

Thanks Kent!\n\nWhy are so many contemporary serif fonts omitting a bold italic face? I noticed at least a few other good faces without a bold italic. What gives? On occasion when I use reversed type, I’ll use the bold weight for legibility purposes. With as many books and publications we mention in our text, a bold italic is a must.\n\n[—Blake](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163542/http:/www.blakedinsdale.com/)  \n [Illumination magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163542/http:/illumination.missouri.edu/)\n\n"

      "content": "Blake — I thought the Bold Italic might make a difference. That’s why I mentioned it.\n\nI can’t speak for others about omitting the bold italic, but for me, I never expected Whitman to be so well received. My personal focus is on book work, and I almost never use bold italic. I expected the face to appeal only to a few others with similar needs.\n\nFrankly, I was more interested in getting the initial fonts released, and then possibly doing the bold italic later, if there was call for it. In restrospect, this was probably a bit short-sighted, but I’d already spent about two years on the design and I really wanted to see some return before investing in more styles.\n\nThere was a brief bit of internal debate at FB about releasing the family without the bold italic. And Mike Parker told me the cautionary tale of Ruzicka’s Primer, which was released without a bold and never got one, which Mike argues really hurt its success. I promised that I would get to it after we’d had a chance to see how well Whitman was received.\n\nThen, as fate would have it, I became immersed in an all-consuming director job for a couple years.\n\nSo, I’m only now coming around to finish up the family. Better late than never, I suppose.\n\nAlso, from conversations I’ve had with other colleagues, Bold Italic is held by many to be something of the ugly step sister in most families, and many designers dislike doing them. It seems this is often the first style passed off to interns or assistants.\n\n— Kent.\n\n"

I can also sympathize with the frustration on that occasion when it turns out you need it and it’s not there. For example, more than once I’ve spec’ed heads in one of the bold Bureau Grotesques after having carefully grilled the editor or scoured the manuscript to make certain that there aren’t any book titles or emphasis in a heading — only to have an eleventh-hour edit or AA introduce something that absolutely \\*must\\* be italicized. Very frustrating.\n\n<cite>How difficult is it to test drive fonts from Font Bureau? I noticed they have that option.</cite>\n\nBlake — Yours seems like a very serious and sincere exploration. I know that FB does work out test licenses on occasion. It’s not my place to make any promises; I’m just a freelancer. If you have good control over your design and production team and fonts don’t stray out of the office, then give the Font Bureau a call and talk to Harry Parker. He can give you the low-down on test drives. He’s typically in the office afternoons and into the evening, Eastern time.\n\n— K.\n\n"
