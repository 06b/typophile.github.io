As soon as I upgraded my Q 6.1 to 6.5, documents with DIN Light open with errors in locating that font.\n\nI’ve tested the font in Illus with no problem.\n\nI tried reloading the font and that didn’t get me anywhere either.\n\nWhat gives? I’m stumped.\n\nThanks for any tips.\n\n.a\n\n [‹ Crossfont: convert Type 1 to OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20080324121203/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15285 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Exported fonts (for PC) dont look great on paper ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080324121203/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15419 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
