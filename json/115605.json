  "content": "Hey guys, I searched for this topic meticulously but I can`t seem to find good answers on the internet (maybe I looked in the wrong places, i can`t tell), so maybe some of you can help me out.\n\nWhat is the correct procedure of carrying the look and feel of your mobile app typeface to the different markets, especially if the typeface doesn`t support certain glyphs like the asian ones. Are you actually looking for alternatives in the that language (if so where?), or are you simply using the iOS/Android unicode feature in which the device replaces the type with a standard OS typeface.\n\nThanks for any help in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "I would say \"correct\" depends a lot on your budget! :-/ I say this because ideally you'd like to have a custom font (or a custom extension to a font you're using) that handles everything you need, but that can be very expensive... On the other extreme you could do a passable job by carefully choosing free fonts; you won't get a high level of visual harmony, but people will certainly be able to read it. Somewhere in the middle: choose a libre (free to modify) font that has as much of what you need as possible, and pay somebody to extend it. It all depends on how visually picky you are.\n\nhhp\n\n"
