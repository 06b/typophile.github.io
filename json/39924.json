  "content": "Hi,  \nI'm in a bit of a quandary, and could do with some advice.  \nI'm doing various leaflet / flyer marketing pieces.  \nThe company's logo uses Eurostile, and have used Eurostile in various things like signage in the past.\n\nSo I was thinking to keep continuity, of using Eurostile for headings etc, and mixing it with another font for the body text.  \nI'm In a number of minds over what font to contrast with Eurostile, sans, or serif. maybe a 'super family' with both?  \nI've looked at fonts like Melior, and ITC Fenice, which have similarities with Eurostile, but them seem a bit sharp and mean.  \nI suppose the feel should represent quality and sincerity, friendly and inviting.\n\nOr should I scrap the idea of using the font in their identity,  \nand just choose one font with a good range of weights, and use that throughout, for titles and body text etc. ?\n\nAny ones suggestions of what direction they think would be good to go would be very much appreciated.  \nToby\n\n",

      "content": "I like Melior and I think it's a great text companion for Eurostile; I probably would have thought to suggest it even if you hadn't mentioned it. I definitely find it a friendly and inviting face myself... but as mentioned I like it so I'm probably not being impartial.\n\nNot so fond of Fenice as a text face, but a lot has to do with the letterspacing, leading and size. I bet a good designer could set with it and I'd go, “Hmmm, that's nice!” when I looked at the page (probably by using wider spacing than I'm generally fond of). I have the same reservations about Bodoni but I've seen it and liked it for text without consciously paying attention to how it was set.\n\nI would prefer not to pair Eurostile headings with a sans text face given the choice, but I've seen it used with Helvetica in the past and it didn't suck - the very blandness of Helvetica means it doesn't fight with Eurostile's characteristics. So how about Neue Helvetica 45? Might be worth giving Optima a shot too, you might like them together.\n\n"

      "content": "I think it's a good idea to keep their identity going - see if you can work the Eurostile into the materials. Altho I don't think of Eurostile as particularly \"friendly and inviting\". I think your instinct to mix it with a serif font is a good one, both because they're less likely to fight and because serifs are a little more friendly.\n\nSomething else by Novarese (you mentioned Fenice) is a good way to start. Maybe look at the font Novarese? Altho both it and Fenice lack italics. Belizio?\n\n"

Does that seem a fair assessment?\n\n"

However if you \"have to\" use any other typography I would suggest a serif, at leas to look for an excuse/change... But still thinking that 1 typography in a artwork is more than enough. Keep it simple... as Bruno Munary would say: \"design is simplifying no complicating\".
