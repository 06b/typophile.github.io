Actually there are only problems when I try to insert certain ligatures. These ligatures are fi fl ffi ffl and st. There are no problems with other characters or other ligatures(sp ct ch).\n\nIt is really irritating because I have absolutely no idea why this is happening. :(\n\nHope somebody can help.\n\nMagnus\n\n",
