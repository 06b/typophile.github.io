      "content": "I did not know minion was designed to be myriad's pair. Makes sense though. The subject matter is information for brochures of various topics (things like 'quit smoking', 'pre-natal care', 'payment arrangements' etc.)for a hospital. The problem is that the hospital does not have an in-house design dept. so everything is outsourced. The result is that all the brochures look like they come from different entities and not from the hospital itself. I've been exploring ways of unifying the design and, for starters, want to standardize the typography. I was thinking about something sturdy, timeless and friendly. Myriad came to mind but was wondering about a companion text.\n\nIM\n\n"

It would be a bit too much for those who are not familiar with type setting in general . Fresco and Charter are both excellent choices and I'm sure it would be much easier to use for the non-typographer. MVB Verdigirs is a beauty but a little \"too sharp\" for me. I think I'll go with Charter. Thanks soo much Mr. Coles\n\nIM\n\n"

Myriad wasn't intended specifically to match with Minion. However, both have been bundled with Adobe apps for a long time, and almost everyone has a version of both.\n\n"

In general, I find that an unmodulated sans like Myriad is comfortable dancing with more spartan serifs (unbracketed for example - whitman, chapparal, scala etc).
