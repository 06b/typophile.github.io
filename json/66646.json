Allowing you to give a very subtle rounded edge to fonts.\n\nThe example uses Helvetica, but we can notice a soft / rounded edge ... especially on the \"15\"\n\nAny info is welcome! :)\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen shot 2010-01-25 at 9.43.08 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202005850/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-01-25%20at%209.43.08%20PM.png) | 235.42 KB |\n\n",
