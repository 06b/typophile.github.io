  "content": "Hi,   \n   \nhere's another logo I've been working and will present it to the client next week. This is tricky one. The name of the company is called GRUPO REPOLHO. It's the portuguese name for \"cabbage group\" where repolho is the family name of the owners. The company is a big group of transportation, construction, machine rental and landscape/nature recovery related.   \n   \nOn my first ideas I realized the logo needed a \"motion\" look like a wheel (machine rental also added this wheel idea). Now the name REPOLHO (cabbage) was also a starting point, altough it's a kind of strange name for a company like this.   \n   \nSo the task was to do a cabbage brand that has some motion and that looks cool. I came out with a logo that I personally like a lot, and I'm showing it here for your advises on the type/font i should use along it.   \n   \n   \n1. Here's a photo of a repolho ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417164141im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417164141im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10990.jpg)   \n   \n2.

A preview on the cards, I'm thinking on having the logo \"embossed\" on the papper, so the back of the card has the brand on papper with the negative emboss simmulated by the tint color...   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417164141im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10992.gif)   \n   \nThe font I used is Adobe Myriad Pro which falls under the \"Overused fonts\". Anyone has a suggestion on a typeface that match the mood of the brand/icon? Thanks in advance.\n\n",

Perhaps you could try the same shape only more regularised? Or, perhaps you could provide two versions of the same form, for use by different businesses within the Grupo Repolho: so they could have a more mechanical looking version for their transport and machine rental and a more organic version for use with their more environmental businesses.\n\n"

In fact, I'd say it's brilliant.   \n   \nI would also go with a serif font instead (but I must confess I generally dislike any sans.) Perhaps you should consider a family with an incised weight to harmonize with the \"incised\" highlights on the outer cabbage leaves. Either way, something more organic-looking.   \n   \nPerhaps something by [Akira Kobayashi](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417164141/http:/www.itcfonts.com/fonts/product.asp?nCo=AFMT&st=keyword&sk=kobayashi) would do.

The logo works for me too much as 'healthy', 'reform', 'nature', etc.   \nYou can use the gag of designing the logo for a mechanical company like that in a very 'nature shop'-kind of way. But if you do that, the typography is very important.   \nYou have to remember that it is a mechanical company. Maybe a straight forward kind of typo is better. Helvetica sounds good to me.   \n   \nPerhaps changing the colour is a help. You could do that for the differtent specialities within the company, thereby creating sub-logos. At least you take the edge of the 'nature-look'.   \n   \nRegards,   \nRen\n\n"
