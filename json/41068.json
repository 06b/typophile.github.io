  "content": "hello.\n\nand help.\n\nI’ve embarked on a redesign of a printer’s logo.  \nthe original is pretty good - it features a lovely ligature,  \nbut is pretty much a straight out treatment of Mrs Eaves.\n\nI have taken a fresh look, and decided to develop a modified version  \nusing classic British font Clarendon, customised and redrawn to become a unique, distinctive and balanced logotype unique to miter.\n\njob done?\n\nnot quite. my lovely clients cannot quite see the point, or much of the difference between the forms. To me, the new, bold version is punchy, solid and prestigious.  \nthey think its just an old font...\n\nso, its to the forum...\n\nI’d like some thoughts, any thoughts... but mostly a vote for A, B or C:  \nold, plain or bold (both custom variations of the clarendon font)\n\nthank you!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [3logos.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153513/http:/typophile.com/files/3logos.pdf) | 66.81 KB |\n\n [‹ Logo Advice please](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153513/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41546 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo for real estate doctors ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153513/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41385 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But also because I find Mrs Eaves a rather distinct and, in a way, elegant font allowing the logo to suggest that this particular printer, can deliver such high quality results (I can’t see that with clarendon - it’s quite bold and harsh in my opinion).\n\nGeorge Triantafyllakos - backpacker.gr\n\n"

      "content": "The problem might be with using Clarendon. I’d guess that many printers, especially those who are well-established, see Clarendon as a jobbing font and not something which represents quality work. Those of us who weren’t around to experience Clarendon the first few times around see it has something unique and fresh.\n\n"

      "content": "Those are interesting points Tiff! Looking at the examples what I am most struck by is the ligature in all versions being somehow less that ideal. If I was going to re-do a mark like that I would concentrate on\n\n- spacing, the old spacing is okay but not great  \n- a better base form. Mrs Eaves has a nice femme feeling but it isn’t the best you can do in the category I think.  \n- think about special fitting or alteration of the forms so they synch up further. Maybe look at Doyald Young’s stuff a little.  \n- Look at a wide range of “it” ligatures and see if there isn’t one that reads better\n\nI say all this advisedly however; because I don’t know if why they wanted this done. What were the goals of this project? For all I know you should be using DIN or Courier!\n\n"

      "content": "I prefer the Clarendon Bold. I like the symmetry of it better. It seems to make more of a statement. But maybe they wanted something more understated. I don’t know but either way from a non-designer’s point of view I can see how they find it hard to see the difference.\n\n"
