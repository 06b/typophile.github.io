Frutiger is a [humanist](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/humanist) [sans-serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif), and has become one of Adrian Frutiger’s best-known typefaces, along with [Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Univers). The weight of the forms are much less monotone than Univers, and due to these subtle thicks and thins the typeface has far more character. Since the 1980s, the fonts have been available in digital form from [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype).\n\nFrutiger has been an extreme success, and in 2003 it has been revised ( [ASTRA-Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ASTRA-Frutiger)) for use on highway signage in Switzerland. In addition, the typeface was revised and updated in 1999 by Adrian Frutiger himself (together with [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype)) to include true italics among other features; this typeface is called [Frutiger Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frutiger%20Next).\n\nThe [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/www.linotype.com/) website has overview pages showing all the weights of the [Frutiger type family](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/www.linotype.com/469/frutiger-family.html) and [Frutiger Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231936/http:/www.linotype.com/53781/frutigernext-family.html).\n\n",
