  "content": "So, client went withthe Eight Shape, so I took the crap out of the middle and went with two leaves on the side. Created a two colour version, that can obviously work in just black as well.  \nIm really stuck on the placement of a typographic mark with the loogo mark. They need to exist together but I cant seem to nail it down. Would love some ideas from the well informed.\n\nEdited Version. . .\n\nChanged to Centennial. .. . still iff'ed out about the placement.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [eighth\\_day\\_final.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021202631/http:/typophile.com/files/eighth_day_final.pdf) | 206.04 KB |\n\n",
