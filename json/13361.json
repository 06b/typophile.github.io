  "content": "I wonder if anyone here might have a decent showing of the old Art Nouveau typeface Kobe that they might be willing to scan and send my way. Right now all I've got is a small, low-res, curled page scan.\n\nI need Kobe (solid), not Kobe Open.\n\nAmongst all of my books and catalogs, I find only one limited showing of Kobe Open – which is useless for my needs. I don't think that it is on any of the Dover/Dan Solo CD-ROMs, but perhaps in one of their 100 Font picture books?\n\n",

It's probably buried under at least a ton of paper, but if I can find it over the weekend I will scan and send it to you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, you can tell by the junk I kept!\n\n"
