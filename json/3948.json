The identity consists of the name typeset in a heavy version of Helvetica, but there is no rule whatsoever, so it sometimes ends up typeset in Tahoma or Arial.   \n   \nThey wanted only a slight finetuning to the identity and a comprehensive set of brand usage standards. So we decided to preserve the equity by keeping the all-caps logotype. So I drew the two versions of the custom lettering and they chose to go with the second one put it in the previous soft corners triangle. I am not sure, however, if the overall lettering looks decent, to say the least... I am particullary worried about M and E... also, does this look similar to any font you know?   \n   \nthank you a lot,   \ngeorge // cellsius design\n\n"

The initial solution (with the logotype used twice at different sizes) seems highly unfortunate ... besides, it is not a good choice ( from the distinctiveness point of view...), as all corporate identity manuals point out...   \n   \ngeorge // cellsius design\n\n"
