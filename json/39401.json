  "content": "Quite unexpectedly a fragment of our concert in Paris last year popped up on YouTube. As it was captured by an amateur cinematographist ;^), the sound isn't too great, so the beginning doesn't make too much sense. Hear (and see) us rock out on [Elsewhere](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019083008/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0cBrcg1uxM). The original brief for the drum pattern was: _\"Make it sound like a cross between a marching band and a runaway train\"_. We usually play this one at the end of our set, because I'm pretty beat after that. :^P\n\n",
