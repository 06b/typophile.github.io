  "content": "I'm designing an identity and web site for a company who does downhill (cruiser) bicycle tours. I'm considering Leviathan Black Italic (maybe all caps) for the logotype and looking for some suggestions in regards to a face pair with it. Something that is not so extended as the other Proteus project faces. The personality should be friendly, fun, exciting, and somewhat informal yet professional.   \n   \nMy initial thought was Base Twelve Sans, but otherwise I'm drawing a blank. Ideas?\n\n",
