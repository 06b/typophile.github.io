This lettering style is an unusual  \ncombination of Germanic Blackletter and Romanized capitals with an Italic  \nslant. It is evocative of “old world” craftsmanship and early 20th century  \nromanticism.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/larkin.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829183604/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/larkin.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/larkin.html\")\n\nNumismatic  \n—————  \nNumismatic was a font offered by the Devinne Press in 1905. It was based on  \nletters, Arabic figures and ornaments used by designers and engravers of  \nseals, coins, medals and inscriptions upon metal or stone during the  \nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  \n [http://www.p22.com/ihof/numismatic.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829183604/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/numismatic.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/numismatic.html\")\n\nIn addition to our latest font releases, P22 is offering the new Lanston  \nt-shirt unveiled at Typecon in New York City. The shirt features Goudy  \nHeavyface on the front and a Monotype font matrix case on the back.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/products/shirts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829183604/http:/www.p22.com/products/shirts.html \"http://www.p22.com/products/shirts.html\")\n\nIf you would like more information, please reply.\n\nBest Regards.  \nP22 Type Foundry  \n——————————————-  \nP22 type foundry, Inc.  \n International House of Fonts  \n Lanston Type Company  \n Sherwood Type  \nPO Box 770  \nBuffalo, NY 14213  \n [http://www.p22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829183604/http:/www.p22.com/ \"http://www.p22.com\")  \nPhone: 716-885-4490  \nFax: 716-885-4482  \n——————————————-\n\n",
