I'd like to set his name in a typeface that says \"New Orleans!\" but I really have no ideas. Something a bit french-looking could work.\n\nIt doesn't have to be serif or script (but I doubt there are any sans that would fit the bill) -- it just has to be appropriate to the city.\n\nthanks!\n\n",

      "content": "If you haven't done it already, I'd say search for images of New Orleans signage (on Google for example) and see what inspires you. My first thought is fonts of the 1920s, seeing as N.O. if famously the home of Jazz and the 1920's being 'the jazz age' I'd say that's a good a starting point as any. For vintage fonts in general, you should really try [www.letterheadfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201121941/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/ \"www.letterheadfonts.com\"). They also have a series of galleries, which may inspire you.  \nIf you see a font in your search and want to know what it is, then come back with an image of it and I'm sure we can identify it (famous last words).\n\nJH\n\n"

One of the teachers was giving credit of some kind for posting images of New Orleans signs to Typophile blogs.\n\nDo a Typophile search for New Orleans signs and you'll find a trove of images of signs and lettering of all types from the NOLA area.\n\n"
