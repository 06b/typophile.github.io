  "content": "Hi folks. First time poster, long time lurker on Typophile.\n\nI'm looking to get some feedback and/or ideas about a poster I'm designing for an event called \"Four to the Floor.\" I was fooling around with more normal poster designs when I noticed the curious reflectivity of a lowercase \"ft\" onto a lowercase \"tf\". I've tried to play that out, though I don't totally like how the white text fits in. Any suggestions would be appreciated!\n\nThanks.\n\n[http://i39.tinypic.com/24wymh2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725154656/http:/i39.tinypic.com/24wymh2.png \"http://i39.tinypic.com/24wymh2.png\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [fourtothefloor.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725154656/http:/typophile.com/files/fourtothefloor.png) | 26.43 KB |\n\n",
