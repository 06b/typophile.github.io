  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nhere is a logo I am working on. It is for a girl who is starting a website on where she is going to write about modern art exhibitions she has visited. 'zo zie ik het' is dutch and translated it means 'this is how I see it'.  \nThe logo is portaying a person who is standing in front of a picture/painting and at the same time you can read it as an uppercase A. Her first name is Akkemei so this seems appropriate. Because she is writing about the art I thought that a handwriting typeface (marydale) is too.\n\nDo you have any comments/critique?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [zozieikhet.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017144507/http:/typophile.com/files/zozieikhet.jpg) | 20.2 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I like it too; light and clean.\n\nSticking with the handmade idea, you might try actually hand-writing the type and vectorizing it; the feeling of individuality could come through stronger that way. It may be cliché by now but you could also play with the dots in zoz **i** e **i** khet **.** nl — they are often ignored but when attention is paid to them it's a nice touch.\n\nNice work; I'm interested to see how it turns out.  \nDan\n\n"

      "content": "I like the mark very much as well. Very clever. I do agree with others that you need to better communicate the idea of personalized response.\n\nPlanet Propoganda once created a logo for Adams Outdoor Advertising (attached) where they combined the idea of an A and a billboard. To convey the idea of customization, they interchanged the imagery on the billboards. Hopefully this is inspring. I'm not suggesting you rip of Planet Propoganda's mark.\n\nI look forward to watching this evolve.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017144507im_/http:/typophile.com/files/61_Adams_Outdoor_1of4.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017144507im_/http:/typophile.com/files/61_Adams_Outdoor_2of4.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017144507im_/http:/typophile.com/files/61_Adams_Outdoor_3of4.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017144507im_/http:/typophile.com/files/61_Adams_Outdoor_4of4.jpg)\n\n"
