  "content": " **Reviewing Typophile's Google Analytics reveals some interesting highlights from 2009. Presented in order of popularity, based on page views…**\n\n1// The high quality, free font, [Quicksand](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Quicksand) from Andrew (aka [alienbreed](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/user/37327)). The page had 127,035 views in '09 and is still going strong.\n\n2// This [handmade subpixel font thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/node/61920) blew up on Typophile: (87,901 views)\n\n3// The hottest controversy of 2009? [Ikea rebrands with Verdana](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/node/61222). (Still no comment from [Matthew Carter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Matthew%20Carter) -- the man behind Verdana, not the man behind Ikea's design decision.) As a personal note, I'm still smiling at someone's suggestion that they'll miss the \"warmth and cheer\" of Futura when they visit Ikea.\n\nThe second hottest controversy? [Apple's Menlo font](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/node/58625) ( [Menlo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Menlo)) takes some heat for being a near duplicate of Bitstream's [Vera](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Vera). (To my knowledge it's not an intellectual property kind of heat, but a street cred kind of heat.)\n\n4// The [sub-pixel YouTube favicon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/node/60577) magic. This post got picked up by YouTube's web crew who had it implemented on the site. Nice work.\n\n5// And the hottest user submitted how-to of '09: [Setting up a Baseline Grid in InDesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/typophile.com/node/47265).\n\nAnd other numbers?\n\n**12,350 new users** registered to the site. Welcome everybody. Reading the site does not require registration and, so presumably all of these people have something to say.\n\nUsers made **8,650 type ID requests** to the [Type ID](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151937/http:/www.typophile.com/typeid) forum in 2009. The overwhelming majority of which were solved (identified) by actual humans, for free. A testament to goodness in the world.\n\n",
