The terms “Pirate, sharing or questionable” all refer to fonts not obtained in accordance with the font’s EULA. Please consider offering your answer so we may get a large enough sampling to deduct some meaning. It may not really conclude anything, but may be surprising.\n\n [‹ Manicules on Flickr](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001858/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40294 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Introducing the \"hr\" ligature... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001858/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40269 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But, eh...whadamIgonnado?_\n\nYou could define the term.\n\nI think for the most part, when related to fonts as this discussion is specifically, it is applied as a verb to the act of sharing or otherwise giving or obtaining without a license when a license is required to do so. As a noun, one who shares or otherwise gives or obtains without a license when a license is required to do so.\n\nWhat would the proper definition be?, and please don’t mention eye patches, parrots, the letter R pronounced arrrrrrrr or any other of ye scalawag terminology.\n\n"

I’d call the latter a pirate, the former a copyright infringer.\n\nIronically, in the US, it’s ’illegal’ for me to copy an Adobe font from a friend and use it, but perfectly legal for me to print it out, rescan it back in and sell is as my own font for profit.\n\n"

The line between ’fair use’ and out-and-out piracy is getting more and more blurred as well. Mom scanning a funny picture from a magazine for her kids is a far cry from me selling copied CDs of Veer Stock Photos for $10 each.\n\n"

Most people seem to be honorable and good with a few less than admirable typophile denizens who admit to doing commercial work with stolen fonts. Not an extremely scientific poll and not a great represention of the design public since this was only posted on typophile, but an interesting snapshot.\n\n"

Without reading sarcasm into it now, it would in fact be a level or two beyond just not pirating fonts, but looking out for others’ work to minimize piracy (intentional IP theft), A noble effort indeed. In the season of giving and recieving, the less that is given and recieved that infringes on others is the best gift of all for those who try to make their living by doing quality type design.
