  "content": "It's grotesk!\n\nFive hours isn't enough time to measure anything or work out the spacing properly. I worked by eye, nothing was measured. Helvetica is pretty easy to draw. Ellipses and sticks. Make the inside ellipse very small, then once you've made a simple l and v it's over. You'll be blatting bugs before breakfast.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bugset_3573.gif)\n\nBug Blatter only looks good with tight spacing to match the interior spaces. I like how c and C come out. z is knackered. There's a lot of cheating going on with stroke width and counter position.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bug1_5981.gif)\n\nRay Larabie's type design axiom: \"If you work on a font long enough it will turn into Helvetica\"\n\nI'm sure somebody has already done this, going by this magazine cover:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/life_apollo_9_6586.jpg)\n\nI didn't fake that. Honestly, It's real. Can anyone identify the font used?\n\nI'm too busy with other stuff to draw any more of Bug Blatter. :^) that's good in a way.\n\nNo plans to market it or proposition Linotype/Monotype about adding it to Helvetica, but what do people think?\n\n\\* Would you use it, and what for?  \n\\* I figure it would be okay for paperback covers, t-shirts, signage, logos and some kinds of magazine design. It would make good laser-cut perspex letters, 2 inches thick, say.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/moonsuit_5653.png)\n\nThis looks much better with negative tracking:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jpcrow_3510.jpg)\n\nAll comments welcome!\n\nj a m e s\n\n",

This will fill in the negative space in the \"corners\" of the round letters. It's that mega-ultra-friggin-bold paradox we discussed back in the days when I Kayoed\\* something. All that bold-meat has to come from somewhere. The other thing you can do is start cranking the x-height more. So, if you scale the lowercase up a smidge and reduce the weight on the stems or whatever-the-hell-else you feel like reducing, you'll have a pleasingly plump version of a famously dull Swiss font.\n\n\\*kayo is an extreme-mega-ultra-black where the priorities are weight gain and maintaining the silhouette of the svelties.\n\n"

Arrow key bap 'em around so the x-height is high and the overshoots are nice. Then just make sure the lowercase stems are about 8% narrower that the caps or they'll look eighties/Meta-ish.\n\n"

Possibly this is a sub-conscious attempt to depict the gluttony and sloth, the moral corruption of the higher-ups within the church.\n\nCheese sounds great. I was thinking of putting an inline in there but that's a lot more work. But the cheese theme could be done with minimal pain by adding circles inside the letter bodies and half circles on the edges so it looks half-munched.\n\nAslo try: luring fat hunks of cheese into an enormous wicker basket and torching it.\n\nThe overshoots are all over the place. It could take on more more x-height for sure.\n\nMore superelliptical, mmmm...\n\nJelmar,  \nthe detailth maketh Helvetica apart from Arial. Hellvetica hath no fury.\n\nThanks everyone. I'll try to work on this s'more later in the week, weather permitting.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Helvetica can be made with little thought or effort in about sixteen hours.\n\nEben --- typeface design does not make sense. If you think that it does then quite possibly you are taking type design too seriously. Type design as handed down to us by the 16th century Venetians is only _meant_ to make sense, but the rules and conventions are rather illogical and convoluted.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
