I wish I had kept mine. Wouldn't recommend buying old sheets though, they had a short enough life when they were in general use.  \nTim\n\n"

The sample book had a price of $1.00. Dang.\n\nI've kept the thing ever since he got out of college and then collected a number of others. In looking through these books one can easily find a lot of really nice display faces of which there is no \"digital\" TTF, T1 or OTF version. I'd love to have OTFs of faces like Transmission or Magnificat.\n\n"
