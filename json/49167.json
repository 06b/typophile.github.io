We got our first mailing out to our buyers a bit late and wanted to give them more time.\n\nNearly 40% of the buyers of this shirt also bought our first, \"Helvetica Neue Descending a t-shirt.\" Talk about customer loyalty.\n\nAs several of them came from here, I want to thank this vibrant community for being so supportive of this new venture.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017130417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/univwhtank_5502.jpg)\n\n",
