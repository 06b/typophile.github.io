  "content": "Hi there,  \nI'm working on a logo and need some help identifying the right font to use.  \nI'm looking for a sans-serif font with soft rounded edges, preferablly something with a single-stack lowercase \"a\". I like the humanistic qualities of Avenir but obviously this font isn't rounded.\n\nI also like the style of the font in the new esurance logo, which I have attached below.\n\nFonts that I've considered so far include:  \n1. Comforta (although I feel like it's almost too rounded).  \n2. Museo (getting closer but some of the elements remind me of an old typewriter font).\n\nAny suggestions would be really helpful. Thanks so much!  \nAdon\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [url.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414233441/http:/typophile.com/files/url.gif) | 23.05 KB |\n\n",
