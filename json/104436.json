  "content": "Following a request by a student asking how to cite Typophile for her graduate thesis,&nbsp;specifically, _how to cite and reference the same person multiple times from the same thread on a forum with pages as opposed to a single scroll_.&nbsp;I checked the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Sixth Edition, only to discover that they actually don’t have a proper way to do this. I expanded upon their recommendation, it and brought it to their attention. The main points are:\n\n1. Provide an in-text citation every time you cite something from Typophile.\n\n2. In your references, regardless of how many times you have cited the same person, you only need a reference for each group of citations by year. Provide another reference should you cite the same person from a different year — which is not uncommon for long threads. Below is an example of four in-text citations which span a two year period, which only requires 2 references:\n\n————\n\n**In-text citations**\n\n“This is the first quote or passage.” (Dean, 2008, September 7, Page 8, 17:33).\n\n“This is the second quote or passage.” (Dean, 2008, December 22, Page 9, 09:02).\n\n“This is the third quote or passage.” (Dean, 2009, January 6, Page 9, 17:45).\n\n“This is the fourth quote or passage.” (Dean, 2009, January 11, Page 11, 12:22).\n\n**References**\n\nDean, C. T. (2008). Re: Thread title [Online forum comment].

You make the appropriate in-text citation (Lozos, C. 2000) and reference, but, when the reviewer goes to check the URL, all they will see is a screen name — dezcom, and they may be unable to validate your source. If a reviewer can’t validate your source they may not let it be published, and you would have to remove content, citation, and reference entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, please be mindful that&nbsp;a failure to properly cite and reference a source, even an online forum, is&nbsp; **plagiarism**.\n\n",
