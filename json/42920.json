      "content": "Hi Kiko,\n\nI don’t know if padding (always having three digits) is an option. Don’t think so.\n\nBut there’s a quite simple workaround: create 3 master pages (can be cascading).  \nThe first has ‘00+_A_’ as page number and gets applied to pages 1–9. The second has ‘0+_A_’ and is for pages 10–99. And the third has the plain ‘_A_’, for pages 100–999.\n\nThe leading zeros are ‘hard-coded’, _A_ stands for the automatically inserted page number.  \nF\n\n"

If you want the pages to number 001, 002, . . . 010, 011, . . . etc ,you will have to start a new section for each. One for 001-009, another for 010-099, another for 100+, otherwise the 00 will continue through the document. The section numbering is done in the document, not the master pages.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n"
