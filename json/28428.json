  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m fairly new to FontLab (5.0.2 on MacOS 10.4.7) and OpenType editing. Because I’m not sure I want to use the Th ligature in my custom version of Adobe Garamond Pro, I tried making it a “discretionary” ligature. That is, I cut the substitution lookup for T\\_h from the liga feature and then pasted it into the dlig feature. (The same for T\\_h.caron and T\\_h.commaaccent.)\n\nThe features then worked the way I wanted in FontLab’s own Preview/OpenType panel – and also, when I had generated and installed the font, in TextEdit.\n\nBut in InDesign 2.0.2 – I know, very old! – the Th ligature still shows up when only the “standard” ligatures are on (Basic Character Formats/Ligatures).\n\nAnyone have a clue why this is happening? Is it a bug in this old version of ID? (I’m gonna have to update the program pretty soon anyway.)\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks, Göran, but I haven't used the ID fonts folder. It currently has only one font in it, KozMinStd-Regular.otf. And I have no font managers. I have just installed the fonts by double-clicking them and then using FontBook (also to deactivate older versions – but it doesn't help if I completely remove these). All other edits that I have made to the font so far have worked in ID.\n\n"
