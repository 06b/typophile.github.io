I dropped the \"finish install OSX\" file into the terminal window and it seemed to install. But when I try the test--typing \"autohint -h\"--I don't get information about autohint, but rather an error message, \"-bash: autohint: command not found\"\n\nCan someone give me more detailed instructions or tell me what I am doing wrong?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

The shell keeps track of directories of programs it will run without specifying the full location. In unix parlance people refer to this as the \"path\". So one might say that the \"autohint\" program is not \"in your path\".\n\n"
