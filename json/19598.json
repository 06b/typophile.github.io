  "content": "I have a slight case of OCD. Although, I'd be willing to bet that most graphic designers do. It is part of the job to have an insane obsession with details. Anyway, as I struggle with obsessing over the details, sometimes it spills over into not wanting wrinkles on my bed or color coding my closet ... and even folding my t-shirts. I received this in my e-mail today and suddenly felt a wave of normality wash over me when I realized that at least I didn't fold my t-shirts _this_ perfectly.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[http://www.typegirl.com/temp/HowtoFoldaShirt.MPG/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023173936/http:/www.typegirl.com/temp/HowtoFoldaShirt.MPG/ \"http://www.typegirl.com/temp/HowtoFoldaShirt.MPG/\")\n\n",

I can leave things absolutely messy all of the time, but the moment I arrange something it has to be perfect. I create \"margins\" around objects when tidying up my desk. Recently my boss asked me to tidy up a bit, and I replied \"I forgive you, for you know not what you do.\"\n\nThere's now a near-perfect 1/4\" margin surrounding everything from my phone to the stapler.\n\n...I will be folding everything in my closet when I get home.\n\nFailure is the condiment that flavours success - Truman Capote\n\n"

      "content": "I've got OCD in my family, but I just have some of the chemical vestiges of it; my problems are different, for the most part. Still, I do find myself-- like someone mentioned above-- careening between unholy tornadic messiness and extreme neatness. When I do swing in the neatness direction, I always have a method, and I'm ferocious about it. Not one speck of dust, not one unwiped spot. Even as a child, I cleaned my room in \"rows,\" kind of like a vacuum cleaner or lawnmower. I still do it-- something about moving along the surface from 0,0 to x,y that just \"satisfies\"! One of my earliest memories is of picking up bits of lint and placing them neatly in a pill bottle that my dad used for electrical components like resistors and capacitors. Still, I am patient only in bursts (impatiently patient?). I can spend three hours sorting screws on my workbench, but it'll take a few months before I'm ready to do that again (most recently, I spent 90 minutes removing every one of a couple hundred nails from a pile of mostly rotten roof planks). As for clothing, I have folding methods, but I think a lot of people do. What I find curious, though, is that I fold things differently than I used to. Like, my mother taught me how to make a \"ball\" out of a pair of socks by rolling them up and wrapping the open end back 'round the ball thus formed. Now I just put them together and wrap the end down about an inch or so, just enough to keep them bound together. When and why did that change, I wonder? The only indication that any of this is OCD is that I had to forbid my wife from folding my t-shirts, because her method just got under my skin and I had to re-fold them all. I don't know if she's forgiven me yet (\"Fold your own damn t-shirts!\" Ok, yes, gladly, thanks dear!)\n\nOkay, I guess I'm sounding a lot more OCD than I thought. Come to think of it, I usually post, edit, and re-post everything I write here about three or four times.\n\nYikes!\n\n"
