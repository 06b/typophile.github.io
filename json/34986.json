  "content": "I am starting a research project—hopefully to become my thesis—regarding the design of grotesque typefaces. My goal is to identify the commonalities in grotesque type as well as the individual quirks, flaws, and standout features, then use the knowledge gained to develop a neo-grotesque of my own. I think that ten faces will be enough, and right now I am still a little unsure about which ones to choose. Following are fonts I am looking at, I would appreciate your feedback.\n\nThe Current Contenders:  \n1. Akzidenz-Grotesk: A great starting point, as it is the first grotesque to make the jump from jobbing to serious work. Also important as it was the starting point for the design of Helvetica.  \n2. Franklin Gothic: This appears to be the first significant American sans and has remained popular since it was introduced.  \n3. Trade Gothic: I am unsure about including Trade Gothic. While it appears to have enjoyed decades of popularity, the more I look at it, and into its history, the less reason I see to include it.  \n4. DIN/FF DIN: Important because of the historical signficance of the DIN organization in design and because I think that the narrower, more vertical design than its predecessors which has influenced the design of the neo-grotesques.  \n5. Monotype Grotesk: Again, this one seems much less significant as I move along—its only real significance seems to be that Arial is pretty clearly rooted deeply to the design of Grotesk 215 as well as Helvetica.  \n6. Univers: I’m pretty sure this one requires no explanation.  \n7. Helvetica: Honestly, there’s so much to pick at here that I would love to be able to leave it out for the sake of balance.  \n8. Neue Helvetica: I think that this one should at least be combined with Hevetica, if not dropped entirely. While the design does an excellent job fixing the flaws in the design of Helvetica and making it consistent across weights, from what I can tell, the high cost of complete sets has made it somewhat unpopular.  \n9. Arial: Do I include this one for the sake of its popularity, or just dismiss it as a fluke?  \n10. Meta: Historically Meta seems especially important as the first really popular neo-grotesque. Because Meta is so well designed, an examination of the features Prof. Spiekermann incorporated reveals a lot about its predecessors.\n\nI am also considering adding Verdana to the list, this seems justified as Verdana seems to be the most significant well-designed grotesques meant for onscreen use. It certainly seems like a better choice than Arial.\n\n [‹ Address for Bigelow and Holmes?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314123412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35044 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tools to measure Rendering Speed ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314123412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35001 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I prefer a new category for Meta, “Narrow Information Sans”, which derives from Orator, Trade Gothic, and other categories of type. Verdana? Not sure how you’re associating that with the grotesque category.\n\nI would be interested in further research into earlier (earliest) grotesque designs and their precursors. Helvetica is really quite removed from them in its antiseptic regularity. Showing that evolution I think is interesting.\n\nYou might like to peruse [Stephen’s review of just this same material.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314123412/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/)\n\n"

IIRC the term appeared in _Revival of the Fittest_ and may appear in _The Complete Typographer_. It’s a pretty rarely used term, so the whole notion is murky.\n\n<cite>I would be interested in further research into earlier (earliest) grotesque designs and their precursors.</cite>\n\nAs would I, but that would require traveling to Europe to peruse old specimen books and other printed works, along with learning in German. It would be an excellent graduate thesis (or better yet, a PhD.), but it’s not doable with the time and budget I have for undergrad work.\n\nAs for what fits under the mantle of a grotesque, I guess that it just depends on how loosely one defines the term. I should probably come up with some solid definitions for the categories I want to look at and figure out if they fit under my umbrella of grotesque or if I need to adjust my targets.\n\n"

Berthold AG bought up between 1890 and 1920. In 1957 and 1958 G.G. Lange redrew the whole line to fix a lot of the inconsistencies—although he left a few—and expanded the range. There are some really great threads that explore the history of AG. But it’s been over a century with two devastating wars and some serious economic and social upheavals since those old grotesks were folded into the AG name, so tracking down information is a pretty serious undertaking.\n\n"

I suspect that one would have to dig deeper than specimen books to find the answers.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, today there are many foundries doing “their” grot — OurType and Process spring to mind — and IMO these are more interesting extensions of the genre than widening it to include Meta etc. In fact, Meta has spawned its own genre.\n\nThe Helvetica-ish category is presenterd in the recent FontShop promotion, and Stephen Coles amassed quite a few fonts for that.\n\nWhat do you mean by “significant”? certain forms of historical research could quantify that, eg the gross weight of foundry type sold, or the number of newspaper readers. In general I am extremely sceptical of that term, as it is used by authors to justify there own preferences, preconceptions, and prejudices. I’ve designed a couple of grots, with another on the way, all of which I consider extremely significant! — and for quite different reasons.\n\n"

As much as I would love to do all that research, I fear that it will not be possible with the resources available to me, particularly time. You make a good point about contemporary grotesques, and researching those would probably turn up a lot of useful information about their roots that could later lead to deeper research.\n\n<cite>What do you mean by “significant”?</cite>\n\nSo far I have been thinking of significance in several ways, certainly too losely. I see that I need to reconsider what makes the typefaces significant, in terms of technical/aesthetic developments, history, and influence on descendents and derivatives. Ditching Meta, and even Helvetica, and focusing more on the types that stay closer to the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth century grotesques seems like a much better idea.\n\n"

Gotham falls into some weird vernacular hybrid category (Along with Neutraface and other similar designs) that I’m not about to try categorizing.\n\nAfter thinking about this stuff some more, I see two options  \n1. Cut things off, stylistically, just before Helvetica/Univers. This way I get to focus more on grotesques with a more human quality than those with none. I also don’t have to worry about the grotesque/neo-grotesque categorization arguments. Design-wise, this sends me down the path of a traditional grotesque.\n\n2. Ditch my earlier notion of neo-grotesque and treat Univers and Helvetica as the origin of the neo-grotesque (which after a little reviewing last night I think is correct) and follow those developments up with the newer categories that come with the innovations of Meta, Verdana, etc.. This one is a little more appealing as it gives me reason to explore the definitions of new categories, and to create a contemporary design of my own.\n\n"

The guy would put one chair or something on a pedestal, and go on rhapsodizing about it for a half hour—or maybe it was an hour. It was great. One of the things he always said was that if you want to understand an object, look at the period just before it. Every craftsman is reacting to what came just before, what he has grown up with. It’s true, and that’s the key. So I think concentrating on the original grotesques, and then going forward to look at modifications is a great idea.\n\n"
