Has anyone here used this font and do you have any tips for me? i.e. Suggestions for characters to repeat and layer?\n\nThanks!  \nCarey\n\n",

Under the keys V-Z and v-z I placed start- and endpieces. 0-4 are different lenght straight extensions and 5-9 are not quite so straight extensions. All other keys are corner pieces that can be used as stand-alones or put in rows to make for superb decoration.</cite>  \n<cite>With a little bit of experimentation and maybe colored overlays you can achieve super-phantastic designs.</cite> â€” Gert Wiescher\n\n"
