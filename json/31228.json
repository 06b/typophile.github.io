  "content": "Greetings all, just wanted to let you know that <cite>Helvetica</cite> will have its World Premiere at the [South by Southwest Film Festival](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031428/http:/www.sxsw.com/film) in Austin, Texas, on March 13th. I'll be there to answer questions and buy drinks, along with a few designers from the film, TBA. There will be two more screenings of the film at SXSW later that week, and then screenings at other film festivals museums, colleges, and design conferences. We'll be posting our preliminary [screening schedule](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031428/http:/www.helveticafilm.com/screenings.html) later this week, and planning another 100 or so screenings worldwide for the next few months, so stay tuned.\n\nThanks to all of you on Typophile for all your help. Look for the Typophile \"thanks\" in the film's credits!\n\nCheers,\n\n-Gary\n\n",
