The food is reasonably priced, and concentrates on flavour and experimentation. We encourage a friendly laid back atmosphere, with regular gigs and bands. ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143511im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36010.jpg)\n\n",

There may be applications where its not practical. I'm not saying loose it, what I'm saying is have an alternative if the need arises. Your next post should show us some color ideas.\n\n"

While it is a strong part of the identity it is not directly part of the logo. Im still not sure about the font for cafe.\n\n"

It used to be just a cafe.   \nMust've found some extra money in the budget.   \n   \nAt initial glance, that S could be a snake. But I fear too much would be going on in the logo then.   \n   \nAndrew\n\n"

Lets say he made the O 50% bigger and not blue, i think its an improvement   \n   \nAnd what is a bigger problem in logo development than reading the name wrong?   \n   \nI think the style is great. It just needs some tinkering.\n\n"
