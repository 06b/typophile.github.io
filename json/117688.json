  "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nWalpurga is a witchy display font that comes in two variants - regular & bold - and with four glyphs for each letter. There is a set of ornaments and the in-built open type features produce a random, natural looking effect when activated through the “contextual alternates” feature. Walpurga was created with stylized brush ends that become visible at larger font sizes.  \nHope you enjoy!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Walpurga_poster_6431.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Walpurga_poster2_4267.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Walpurga_poster6_5651.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Walpurga_poster7_5486.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Walpurga_poster8_6603.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Walpurga_poster10_4958.jpg)\n\nAvailable at [Myfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234938/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/julia-bausenhardt/walpurga/) [et al](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234938/http:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/julia-bausenhardt/walpurga).\n\n",
