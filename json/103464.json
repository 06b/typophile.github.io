The closest I can find is [Congress Black](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014220429/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/congress/black/) Designed by Adrian Williams published by Linotype in 1980.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014220429im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CongressBlack_5263.jpg)\n  \nThe counters aka bowls in Congress Black have a more rounded appearance than your lettering, which has something of boxy or squarish effect. I also note that your lettering is wider than Congress Black.  \nDon \n"
