  "content": "hi - first post to the board..\n\nI am working on a huge project, trying to find a warm, \"imperfect\" serif typeface akin to Mrs. Eaves (and Filosofia) . I have spent over 4 days searching and exploring with not too much success, so any pointers would be greatly appreciated. The closest I've come are Fountain type faces, but most of these are a bit too stiff for me.\n\nKeywords:\n\nWarm, human, well crafted, imperfect, vintage, hopefully a comprehensive number of weights.\n\nBy \"imperfect\" I mean that it does not matter if the typeface jumps a bit, like Eaves or is a bit uneven, as long as it gives off that familiar \"warmth\".\n\nMy last ditch effort would be to loosely interpret a given font by hand (pen/paper), but I haven't even been able to find a decent starting point.\n\nplease help - Thanks!\n\n",
