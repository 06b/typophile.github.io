Probably in many other places, also.\n\nThe street sign there, though, is done in all cap abbreviations, thus S AVE D.\n\nBut the letterfit and word space are such that, driving by at 35 mph, it reads as SAVED. Which made me feel very good as I drove past it several times a few months ago, terrible sinner that I yam. Without a camera, so you’ll just have to imagine it. I shall probably never drive by that sign again, and if I do, I shall not likely have a camera. But the message will always be there, and those searching for South Avenue C or South Avenue E will see that message and know that all will be OK.\n\npowers\n\n"
