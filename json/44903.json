  "content": "I posted this in Design, but it occurred to me that this might be a better place:\n\nCan anyone tell me about the differences (if any) between the Adobe version of Berthold Baskerville Book and the BQ version? I’m currently using the Adobe (for book text, 11/15), but I need OsF and real small caps, so I want to buy the expert fonts that include them. I’m wondering if I should just buy the expert add-ons, or whether the BQ version of the rest of the font would be worth it, too. I’m wondering, is the kerning any better? Are there additional ligatures? Also, I find the em-dash on this font to be quite small. My proofreaders mistake it for an en-dash, and I’ve had to swap out the em-dash for another font. I wonder if it’s any bigger in the BQ version.\n\nI tried emailing the US Berthold vendor, but they don’t respond.\n\nMany thanks!  \nHeather\n\n",

Their [Baskerville 10](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417182915/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-77-baskerville-10-cyrillics) sets nicely.\n\nAs for Adobe vs BQ, I do like the BQ version at smaller sizes, but the emdash is actually smaller in the BQ cut.\n\n"
