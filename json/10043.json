Kinda a hybrid font that lives somewhere (vaguely) in a dark corner between neohumanist sans-serif and blackletter frakturs combined with a healthy dose of experimentation.   \n   \nHope you like!   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017082239im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6847.gif)\n\n",

It adds an interesting element, but in regular type it gets a little distracting. Maybe keep it as an alternate. Overall, though, it looks cool.\n\n"
