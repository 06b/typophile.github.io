  "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nHere are two mysteries. The ‘Black Pearl’ script seems very familiar, but I was not able to find it in my Script Guide or my various books. Any ideas about what it is?\n\nThe ‘PORTLAND, OR’ titling face seems similar to Waters Titling, but it’s semi-serif. Anyone know what it is?\n\nThanks for your help,  \n- Mike\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [BlackPearl.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104232/http:/typophile.com/files/BlackPearl.gif) | 138.01 KB |\n\n",

I’ll pass that along to the person with the question.\n\nAs for the titling face, I agree Yves, it does resemble some of Michael Harvey’s work, like [Strayhorn](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104232/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/strayhorn-mt/), but I also found it has similarity to [Rotis Semiserif](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116104232/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/agfa-rotis-semi-serif/), but not a match. I’d like to know what it is.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
