Being a terribly understudied pupil on the matter, I'm currently trying to find a good sans serif font to go with Adobe Jenson Pro. Any suggestions?\n\nMy broader question concerns any practical advice - dare I solicit a method - for pairing serif and sans serif. I know rudimentary things about coupling fonts with like x-heights, but I'm having a hard time putting this precept into action. Take pity! Enlighten me velociously!\n\nthanks,  \nG\n\n",

      "content": "I don't have an answer for you, but I'm glad I'm not the only one who puts off the content of the syllabus in order to choose a new font I've always wanted to try out. I'm almost never happy with the pairings I get between serif and sans serif, however. I was happy once with a presentation template that used Adobe Garamond for titles and Cronos for body text. Perhaps [Cronos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306200803/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=cronos) is a typeface to check out.\n\nI also saw a nice set of handouts that used Garamond for body text and Univers Condensed for headings. In that case, the contrast seemed to work out well.\n\nST\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks much to both of you for your recommendations. The Legacy Sans certainly is an appropriate pairing, but also makes me wonder if I should go for a less rooted-in-centuries past serif font after all. The Garamond/Univers pairing is quite elegant; wish I hadn't sworn off Garamond...\n\n"
