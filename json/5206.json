  "content": "Hi guys,   \n   \nI have a font which is condensed and want to create an extended out of it. Is there anyone that could help me out with a solid way on how to do this best?   \nI think just scaling it doesn't do it, because the verticals become wider, making the font heavier. Any other suggestions besides redrawing the font by hand ;-)   \n   \nThanks,\n\n",

The best use of this technique for me was to put the resulting stretched glyph on the mask layer and use it as a rough guide. Then copy pieces of your orginal font (mostly the joins) and position them over the joins on the stretched mask. You then have to draw new connecting lines or curves. I realize this is no big time saver but designing type isn't really ever a fast-food kind of experience. My advice is to just roll up your sleeves and do the work. What you gain in experience from doing it will only help you later. In type design, it is about the work so just enjoy it.\n\n"

I don't think there's an easy way to do this.   \n   \nWhat you could try it scaling it, then even out the differences between the horizonatal and vertical strokes by hand - ie the horizontals would become heavier, and the verticals lighter.   \n   \nIf you want to try some scaling effect, for characters with simple counters (\"O\") that might mean scaling horizontally the whole character, then scaling the counter \"down\" vertically and \"up\" horizontally (ie 95% \\* 105%).\n\n"
