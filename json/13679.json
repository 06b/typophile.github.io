TrueType differs from Type 1 in that it uses [quadratic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/quadratic%20beziers) as opposed to [cubic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/cubic%20beziers) [bezier curves](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/bezier%20curves). TrueType excels at on-screen rendering due to the fact that it can support sophisticated [hinting](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/hinting) instructions. The technology was cross-licensed with a [Microsoft](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Microsoft) replacement for [PostScript](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/PostScript) called [TrueImage](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TrueImage), but today only TrueType survives. A few years later the format was extended to support [Unicode](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Unicode) and more complex linguistic and typographic behaviours such as automatic ligature substitution and Indic vowel rearrangement. However the new extensions, called [AAT](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/AAT) (Apple Advanced Typography), were not licensed to Microsoft, who then set about creating their own extensions to TrueType (along with [Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adobe)), which they called [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType). The two extensions are incompatible and whilst their feature sets overlap, there are many things that one can do which is impossible with the other.\n\nFor other articles on TrueType, see:  \n\\* [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/WhatIsTrueType.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/WhatIsTrueType.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/WhatIsTrueType.mspx\")  \n\\* [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeFonts.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeFonts.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeFonts.mspx\")  \n\\* [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeHistory.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeHistory.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeHistory.mspx\")  \n\\* [http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115042207/http:/developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/ \"http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/\")\n\n",
