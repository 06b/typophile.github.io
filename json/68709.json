The website has the Flash look without using any flash. it's all Java so it even works on mobile devices...\n\nIf you view the profile of each individual artist there is usually a link to their personal portfolio on the web... check them out!\n\n"

It makes it much easier to manage content.\n\nHere are two portfolio sites that are powered by Wordpress  \n [http://savsec.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018223403/http:/savsec.com/ \"http://savsec.com/\")  \n [http://www.hollisbc.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018223403/http:/www.hollisbc.com/ \"http://www.hollisbc.com/\")\n\nThis is probably the route I will end up going in.\n\n"
