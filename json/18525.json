  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’m sitting here learning Fontographer and have a few questions.\n\n1. As a font-designer, must I learn the hinting process or could I (as the manual suggests) let it be on “auto” and just leave it?\n\n2. When it comes to placing the letter between the sidebearings, I have a theory here which I would be very happy to get some inputs of. In most of the fonts I have used, the letters are placed with equal sidebearings (more or less anyway). But, what really happens when the user later on set the text in one textblock, in InDesign or Quark?\n\nWhat I mean, is:  \nIf you set a headline and bodycopy with different sizes adjusted to the left in the same text-block – the headline is automatically placed a little bit to the right, isnt it? This is due to the left “space” of the character. The bigger the headline, the bigger the distance becomes. To solve this, the user have to make the headline in one separate textblock and move it a little bit to the left in order to get a feel that the headling and bodycopy is on the same vertical “guideline”\n\nTo my theory:  \nWouldnt it be a more user-friendly approach to place all letters as close to the left sidebearing as possible, and build the font according to this approach instead? So that every character starts on “zero”. Then the left margins would be more straight for the user of the font.\n\nLooking forward to hear your thoughts on this matter.\n\nRegards from Sweden\n\nGöran\n\n[www.neptuna.se](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234235/http:/www.neptuna.se/ \"www.neptuna.se\")\n\n [‹ true type to open type](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234235/http:/typophile.com/node/18697 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [char set order ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234235/http:/typophile.com/node/18791 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I give it another try =)\n\nThe V and H always has the same unoptical balance, no matter where it’s placed, isnt it?\n\nKeep the same spacing but move the letters all to the left. Like you take every letter and move them to the left. In my opinion, the same optical problems will always occure if they are to the left, middle or to the right.\n\nAs an example: The “V” would even even break the left sidebearing, then it will look like this in InDesign.\n\nMaybe I’m completely wrong here, but there must have been theories like this before... for me it seems like the font would become more user-friendly.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234235im_/http:/typophile.com/files/breakout_V_H.jpg)\n\n"

I have also been by turns impressed and dismayed by new fonts that become available. Good luck to you - but do you have something original to offer, or another in an interminable list of tweeks and variants. There are not too many typefaces - but there is a lot of shite about - CM/xx\n\n"

      "content": "Dear Privateortheris,\n\nI don’t really understand why you are explaining about your feelings towards new typefaces. My question was regarding hints and a theory about placing the letters.\n\nBut, as a straight and honest answer tou you:\n\nI’ve been into type design for about 2-3 years. My first try for a new typeface I did at the age of twenty years old. I did the design in Illustrator at that time. This font is to be produced & released this year by Type Foundry Psy/Ops ( [www.psyops.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829234235/http:/www.psyops.com/ \"www.psyops.com\")). The name of the font is Neptuna. Maybe you’ll get a chance to see it if you are interested in new fonts and typography.\n\nThe reason for now learning Fontographer (and asking these questions) is to be able to make my design for new typefaces directly in a professional font-editor, instead of Illustrator.\n\nI thought this forum was the right place to ask specific questions regarding building typefaces in Fontographer, or Fontlab.\n\nAnd yes - I do think I have something original to offer, but of course, I let the users be the judge of that.\n\nNow, do you have so knowledge about the hinting process? Please share it, if you have the time.\n\nThanks.\n\n"

      "content": "When I was working in Fontographer, I mainly used autohinting. Fontographer’s manual hinting tools are not very good—they give almost no feedback on the effects of what you are doing. That said, I got mixed results with it, and it was even worse if I tried to do it manually. I don’t think it’s very good with hinting, automatic or manual.\n\nThe hinting tools in FontLab are much better. Perhaps now that FontLab owns Fontographer and is actively developing it, they will improve its hinting algorithms and functionality in the new version they are working on (the first new version in ten years).\n\n"

If not well hinting is done, the letters will form different from what the designer may want?\n\nIs it possible to leave out the hinting process completely, that is no hints at all, and how would it effect the font produced?\n\nThanks.\n\n"

      "content": "Hinting is all about compensating for situations where there not enough pixels or bits to display the font in a reasonable way. What happens is that stem thickness varies, counters fill in, thin features disappear, the characters don’t line up along the baseline, etc. Without hinting, fonts look like a bad fax.\n\nHinting is a way of telling the font rasterizer which parts of the glyphs are important, which parts are stems (and should appear to be the same thickness), and so on. When a font is rasterized, the shapes of the glyphs are altered to fit the pixel grid better and make the font look better at lower resolutions.\n\nIn fact, the character shapes are being distorted, but it’s not possible to display fonts accurately at low resolution anyway, so it’s a good compromise. When the hinting process is not so well done, the hints are inappropriate or incorrect and cause the rasterizer to distort the characters in undesirable ways. The most common problem I have seen with Fontographer’s auto-hinting is characters not always aligning correctly along the baseline or x-height.\n\nHinting nowadays mostly comes into play when a font is displayed on a computer screen. When outputting to medium- to high-resolution devices like laser printers and film, bad hinting or even no hinting is not such a big problem.\n\n"

First, actually, they wanted fonts that were right to the top of the Em, so that the vertical cousin of the problem you describe would be solved. Many display faces in our library are thus crammed to the top of the Em. The right-left problem used to be solved with a 6 pt. space character, and a huge negative kerning pair, or another text box, which technically, is tradiational ;)\n\nIsn’t there something in OT or ATT for this? Like vertical alignment offset or something?\n\n"

Wouldnt it be really cool if something could be done regarding this vertical left side? Type it - and it will fit perfectly.\n\nWhen I think about it again: if a font was build in this way my example shows above, the centered would only be moved a little to the left optically. In my opinion, most of the texts are however placed to the left, so still i found this theory a bit interesting. Or why not make some kind of super-font, that automatically adjusts and choose the version depending on if the text is set left, centered, or right. That couldnt be so tricky to pull, could it? Some script or something... Opentype perhaps, as dberlow speaks about?\n\ndberlow - interesting that some of the display faces are build that way. thanks for sharing the info.\n\nBTW....I wish my english was better... :)\n\n"

It would be nice if we did not have to come up with tricks to make things work. Typographers always have had tricks (using coppers and brass to fix alignment in metal type and kerning LT combinations on a band saw). I think the money in development aspect comes in to play. The profit on type has gotten so small that people can’t afford to put extra time in to really overcome all the problems.\n\nAlso, I very much like your new icon!\n\nChrisL\n\n"
