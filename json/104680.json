Several digital versions can now be found, but none have kept the irregular details of the metal type which include strokes that cross over each other as if hand drawn (see letters K & y). The new Lanston digitization is the only digital version to retain the idiosyncratic treatment which makes the metal type so alluring.\"  \nDon\n\n"
