When I first saw pages 50 to 57, it was like a revelation to me. I was always a bit confused about drawing in FontLab myself until Leslie laid it out to me on these four spreads. This is the most comprehensive overview of drawing in FontLab and so much to the point.\n\nAltogether, every single page of the book is useful.\n\nLeslie's writing style shows off when you read the back cover of the book. But you should wish you had seen the alternate biographies for him and me that he originally planned to put there. That was completely insane stuff! :)\n\nGo grab a copy while Leslie still has some!\n\nBest,  \nAdam\n\n"
