It would be cool to see some words. Maybe uppercase set too?   \n   \nr.\n\n"

Initially I was thinking about pseudoitalic typeface, which would be both clearly readable in small sizes and primitivized, but not 'pixel'. I never use Mac. Uppercase is not so 'compact' but it still preserves the idea. I'll try to post the picture later.\n\n"
