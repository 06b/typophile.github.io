  "content": "Hi everydbody ! Could anyone give me help on identifying this typeface ? I'm not sure wether it's a custom lettering or a specific face. The rounded shapes may also be due to tampography (is that correct ? printing on a 3D object anyway) Seems like it's an 19th century woodtype style. Several font search engines didn't work... Thanks a lot for help !   \n ![Moet & Chandon Champagnes](http://web.archive.org/web/20150101002726im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21331.jpg)\n\n",

Needs a little customizing, but it will work.\n\nA very usefull site is: [http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150101002726/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\")\n\nYou can upload a picture and the site automatically searches the typeface you're looking for!\n\n"
