  "content": "Many have tried and failed to merge Hebrew into English, or vice versa, on the font design level.\n\nAfter all, a Semetic typeface stresses horizontal scribe-like strokes, and a European style typefac stresses vertical cut metal-like bars. So, how can they be merged successfully.\n\nGill tried and failed with each experimentation. Others also fell by the wayside.\n\nFinally, Boruch Gorkin (Monotype licensor to MicroSoft and Apple licencees), a brilliant designer in Manhattan of Russian descent (see www,boruchgorkin.com) succeded in part to make a Hebrew version of Monotype's Ariel (weatch out for those Russians).\n\nBut Ariel was a sans serif with almost the same stroke widths horizontal and vertical. He based his design upon Tzvi Narkiss' popular Narkiss design, adjusting its stroke width a bit, and height to sit between the x-height of the English lowercase and the top of the English uppercase, and improved upon a bit of Narkiss' design.\n\nBut could anyone make a merger in a serif design for Hebrew with varying widths for the horizontal and vertical strokes, and match the overall color of the page in either language?\n\nThis blog shows how.\n\n",

      "content": "Is it possible to place an English font text with vertical dominant bars, like in Minion, alongside a Hebrew font text with horizontal dominant strokes? Seems impossible, ayh?\n\nWon't the Hebrew look radically different from the English, and vice versa, in both structure and relative black-white ratio per inch. The Hebrew letterforms will look darker, wider, shorter,compared to the English letterforms, besides the obvious design differences in orientation.\n\nSo, the differences are four-fold:  \n1. Hebrew is horizontal stroke dominant, while English is vertical stroke dominant;  \n2. Hebrew seems darker, while English seems balanced in color distribution;  \n3. Hebrew letterforms are proportionately wider in relationship to English letterforms;  \n4. Hebrew are proportionately shorter in relationship to English letterforms; see Microsoft's poor renditions of popular Hebrew typefaces, often matching by error the single case Hebrew to the lowercase of English. Clearly, a non-Hebrew reader did this, as to most every Hebrew reader, this looks too small for the type size, rendering it ridiculous like a clown wear long pants that are too short for his legs.\n\nHow can these 4 challenges be overcome?\n\n"

      "content": "1. The orientation difference of horizontal dominance and vertical dominance.\n\nLatin letterforms are printed, and therefore are individual units where the distinction between letters are its dominant vertical bars.\n\nNon-Latim letterforms are scribed, and therefore are much like joined units where the joining-like effect are the dominant horizontal strokes.\n\nIf a Latin face has alternatively dominant horizontal strokes, it looks odd. Conversely, if a non-Latin face has alternatively dominant vertical strokes, it looks odd.\n\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\nWell, this is each group's nature. Change here is unnatural, even perverse.\n\nThe way to overcome the natural diversity is found in its bigger picture.\n\nSomewhat like the saying about seeing the tree and missing the forest, here it's the very opposite: ignore the tree and see the forest.\n\nWhat does this mean in our context?\n\nEvery configuration of text on a page creates a color, a ratio of black to white in a given space.\n\nTo merge English with Hebrew requires a similar and compatible, even complimentary, color ratio of black to white in a given space. The greatest completion of English with Hebrew is total submission, where each blends in together. While compability is only a merger which makes due.\n\n"

      "content": "2. Hebrew seems darker, while English seems balanced in color distribution;\n\nSince the eye is tricked by the different orientation, and Hebrew verticasl strokes are often heavier than English vertical bars, the result is that the Hebrew text seems darker than the English.\n\nThe way to overcome this is by adjusting the letterspacing, or better the side bars, slightly, so the Hebrew text seems lighter to look at, and better match the English.'\n\n3. Hebrew letterforms are proportionately wider in relationship to English letterforms;\n\nHebrew is meant to be understood and concentrated upon. Therefore it's wider than English.\n\nEnglish is made to be read speedily. Therefore, it's narrower than Hebrew.\n\nIn general, as any Hebrew thinker knows, thinking in English is more superficial, because its letterforms are more narrow. Thinking in Hebrew is much deeper and meaningful, because its letterforms are wider. Broadmindedness versus shallowness. This is why Israeli intelligence supercedes even American intelligence.\n\nArabic and Iranian etc. thinking and intelligence will be discussed later.\n\nTo compensate for this awkward sense when English and Hebrew is combined in the same sentence or paragraph etc., and the way to merge English and Hebrew successfully, is to raise the height of the Hebrew letters to a little below the height of the English uppercase, and well above the height of the English lowercase.\n\nIn general, the height and the inter-letterspacing is adjusted carefully to create the illusion of compatibility or completion between the languages.\n\n"

Each language's text or book font must be silent, not show-offish, and conducive to blending.\n\nFor example, Gorkin's version of Narkiss is blendable. Frank's modification of Vilna is blendable. Even Itamar David's very popular David blends in with a subtle falair.\n\nEliyahu Koren's clown-like Koren is not a good text typeface, because it's most every letter shouts \"look at me; I'm a star\". Don't get me wrong it's a beautiful design as display or decorative, but it's not for text.\n\nEliyahu Koren typeset the Bible and the Jewish prayerbook with the Koren typeface for decades. It became a default standard book font, but it's is really not at all. Study its design and just admit it.\n\n"

      "content": "There is another avenue to make the English letters match the Hebrew letters.\n\nIf the type design matches the English horizontal stroke width to the Hebrew vertical stroke width, then yet another dynamic is created, reducing the need for extra inner-letterspacing. Less increasing of the inner-letterspacing is necessary, because the overall color of the Hebrew is much less darker than the overall color of the English.\n\nThe following pages cite visual demonstrations of the above discussed concepts.\n\n"

      "content": "My view on this is that when the normative forms of two different scripts rely on distinct stroke contrast patterns, one must seek to harmonise the overall impact of the type on the page, rather than do violence to either script trying to distort it to match the other. Harmonising the weights of the two scripts so that they produce a similar texture on the page is not as simple as harmonising stroke weights, regardless of contrast patterns, because one needs to take into account also the characteristic shapes and letter densities of the two scripts. In this respect, Hebrew and Latin types are in some ways easier to harmonise than Latin and scripts with greater density, e.g. Korean or Chinese.\n\nI've noticed that in Israeli typography, it is common for the Hebrew letters to correspond to the x-height of a matched Latin design. Whereas in European scholarly publishing it is usual for the Hebrew letters to stand taller, between the Latin x-height and cap-height. Either approach can be made to work if compensations are made in other ways for the stroke weight and density.\n\n"

I can look at a book typeset in an English font and immediately tell you if it looks good or not, and why.

The most correct approach for most situations is to, as Israel pointed out, align the Hebrew body height somewhere between the Latin cap- and x-height. This works best with Latin upper- & lowercase. With the somewhat rare, but feasible, lowercase-only situation, then the Hebrew body height can be correctly scaled to x-height. With all-cap Latin, the Hebrew body height should be scaled to cap-height.\n\n"

I would think that there's a much simpler way to make a Hebrew with a lower case, without having to redraw the letters in a foreign style, if anyone wanted it.\n\nJust make the conventional square script the upper case, and the ancient forms of the letters - in the Paleo Mesha style, where the ascenders and descenders are pronounced - the lowercase!\n\nThere was even Eric Gill's odd attempt at making Hebrew look more like the Latin alphabet. While giving Gujarati that treatment might produce interesting results, and this is no worse than many other cute display faces, the serifs point the wrong way.\n\nAh, and here's another interesting article:\n\n[http://stbride.org/friends/conference/badtype/aleph-x.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414023545/http:/stbride.org/friends/conference/badtype/aleph-x.html)\n\n"

It is 100% the same. When we print from the new font, you can't tell the difference from text being set from lead and from opentype. It's critical for us to have that ability.\n\n"
