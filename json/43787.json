  "content": "I'm a student at SVA and I'm working on setting two bodies of text next to each other in a book. I want to use Futura T1 Light for one, but I'm not sure which typeface to use for the other text. I know I want to use a serif face, but that's about it. I don't have any extra money to buy a type family, so I'm limited to pretty much what Adobe CS3 has to offer, unless I can find something else at school.\n\nAny help would be great.\n\nThanks!\n\nBailey\n\n",

Head over to the library and try reading the [Bauhaus 1919-1933](http://web.archive.org/web/20141225212206/http:/www.amazon.com/Bauhaus-1919-1933-Taschen-25-Archiv/dp/3822850020/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207077544&sr=8-2) to see what I’m talking about.\n\nAnyway, your best bet alongside Futura is a face based on Futura. You can get Memphis light for $20 on MyFonts, that’s not a bad deal.\n\n"

      "content": "If you're going to use Futura, especially Futura Light, for any kind of text, the important thing is to track it V E R Y loose. The bigger the space inside the characters, the more space you need between them – so the light weight needs to be set looser than a bolder weight. And the default letter fit for Futura, at least the commonly available varieties, is much too tight. Open it up, and look at the difference it makes.\n\n"
