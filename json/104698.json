  "content": "Hi.  \nNew to this forum and I'm hoping someone will be able to bestow their wisdom... failing that I'm trawling for hours for the answer on google and it'll make me cry with frustration!\n\nSo I'd like to create a series of posters. These posters use a font as it's focus – word play on a font for the purpose of creating an amusing poster. I aim to sell the posters. Can I do this? Clearly I'll need to license said font to use it on my mac, but then after that I'm unclear as to the ramifications.... i.e. commercial gain of using a font to my advantage.\n\nThe posters would only appeal to designs really, as designers more familiar with fonts/typefaces.\n\nHELP!!!!\n\nMany thanks! :)\n\n",
