  "content": "Hi Everyone!\n\nIm a new member on this forum so I´ll ask my first question!:)\n\nDoes anybody know a tutorial on creating a font from scratch or good expertise advice will do fine! I have a greta dell of experience in grafikart but I think a missed a little basics in creating a good font. I´m mostly selflearned and done it in my way but I think I created shapes i a to complikated way. There ar of course basics that I do know that you first skecth the font on paper, but there are many questions, do experts for example use \"crosslinepaper\"Grid lines? (sorry my english, from Sweden) then scan it and draw it out in Illustrator. But there are many ways to do it in Illustrator. I just learned to use grids and \"snap to grid\" well I think you know what I mean now.  \nMayby I am to perfektionist I dont know. I just want a good rutin and perhaps a new way to design letters in more easier way.\n\nMy wish is if there is a basic videotuttorial (or other will do) from A to Z that really describes in detail how to acomplish a high quality font.\n\n",
