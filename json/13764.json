Word shape is attributed as one of the key factors in [readability](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923063621/http:/typophile.com/wiki/readability) and is widely considered the reason that [lowercase](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923063621/http:/typophile.com/wiki/lowercase) words are more readily recognizable than their [uppercase](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923063621/http:/typophile.com/wiki/uppercase) equivalent. The belief is that because uppercase words always have a rectangular word shape they are less distinct than lowercase words which have a varying word shape, given definition by [ascenders](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923063621/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Ascender) and [descenders](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923063621/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Descender) that create unique, and therefore more recognizable shapes.\n\nWord shape is believed to be one of the two probable ways that information is processed by the eye. Researchers are divided between word shape recognition and [letter identification](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923063621/http:/typophile.com/wiki/letter%20identification) as the process by which information is processed during reading.\n\nSee also [Readability](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923063621/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Readability).\n\n",
