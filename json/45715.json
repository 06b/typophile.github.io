Most (all?) serif typefaces have horizontal bars/serifs on the top and bottom of the uppercase I.\n\nIs there a term for the seemingly rarer case when a sans serif typeface has an uppercase I WITH bars such as in this example?\n\n",

Many all-caps comic fonts have both kinds, so that the serifed I can be used for the personal pronoun \"I\" while the plain I is used in other words; I believe Charles Schulz was the first to adhere to this practice consistently in his hand lettering.\n\n"
