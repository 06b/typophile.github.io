I checked Centrum at Identifont and it does not exist there.  \nThis is all the info that Itentifont has on FontSite:  \n---start quote--  \nFontSite  \nWeb: [http://www.fontsite.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140330063159/http:/www.fontsite.com/ \"http://www.fontsite.com/\")  \nA Web site managed by Sean Cavanaugh and Joyce Lukaczer, it sells OpenType versions of several typefaces licensed from SoftMaker GmbH, as well as some original fonts.  \nFonts published by FontSite:  \nCombi Numerals Ltd  \nCombi Numerals Pro  \nCombi Symbols  \nCombi Symbols CD  \nCombi Symbols DV  \nCombi Symbols PDA  \n---end quote---  \nThe mention of SoftMaker GmbH is suspicious to me, but I don't know.  \nDoes anyone have any good info on the legal status of the FontSite fonts?  \nDon\n\n"
