What is the common method to get it? You do it by measuring it in font bitmaps( first write in some types and save it into bitmaps(say 32\\*32), then check its height) or reading directly from true type font file?\n\nThanks!\n\n"

Maybe a better approximation would be to take the height of the <cite>o</cite> and subtract _twice_ the overshoot below the baseline.\n\n(BTW, why not just measure the height of the <cite>x</cite> itself? Do the serifs sometimes get in the way?)\n\n"

      "content": "There are various software libraries that allow you to access font files directly (rather than calling the Windows API for some information on installed fonts). I think using FreeType 2 would be easiest since it provides object-oriented access to both OpenType/TrueType and Type 1 fonts:  \n [http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107235252/http:/www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html \"http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html\")\n\nFor TrueType or OpenType fonts, you can read out the x-height included in the font using  \n [http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-truetype\\_ta...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107235252/http:/freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-truetype_tables.html#TT_OS2 \"http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-truetype\\_tables.html#TT\\_OS2\") -- see sxHeight\n\nI recommend joining the FreeType discussion list to get more help.\n\nRegards,  \nA.\n\n"
