Apparently it was important to Gaudi that it face due east  hence, entirely disrupting the already established circulation (auto, pedestrian) patterns in that area. He was killed by an errant streetcar on its way through the newly wayward streets. Since Gaudi had been living at the site during its construction, no one recognized him & everyone at the scene thought he was a homeless man. Consequently he was sent to the peoples hospice. As opposed to the decent hospital where the wealthy were taken. Upon finding out the situation, one of the bishops or something went to the hospice, but Gaudi refused to leave. Theres some famous quote which I cant remeber along the lines of I lived with the people & Ill die with the poeple. Which of course he unfortunately did.\n\n"

      "content": "It has been a lot of time without going to Barcelona, too long and no excuse, maybe this year... I have not very hot information but I hope these few and actual links can be useful in your trip:   \n   \nThere are now two exhibitions in the [Museu de les Arts Decoratives](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123745/http:/www.museuartsdecoratives.bcn.es/home.htm) about two catalanes designers, Oscar Tusquets and Carlos Vives, that might worth a look.   \n   \nYou could take also a look at this [one](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123745/http:/www.adg-fad.org/news.php?pg=byid&categ=4&id=212) and the site, can be interesting too.   \n   \nIn Madrid [La Guia del Ocio](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123745/http:/www.guiadelocio.com/madrid/) is a very useful link to know what is going on at the week in the city, in [english too](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123745/http:/www.guiadelocio.com/english/), concerts, movies, exhibitions, etc. I don't now how it works the one from [Barcelona](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123745/http:/www.guiadelocio.com/barcelona/), try it, here you have some [exhibitions](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123745/http:/www.guiadelocio.com/barcelona/buscaarte/index.cfm) for example, I can't find the english version for Barcelona though. In Madrid and in Barcelona (I guess) you can buy the print version more complete (weekly) at the Kioskos everywhere.   \n   \nHope it helps a little.   \n   \nBuen Viaje!\n\n"
