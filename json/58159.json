What's the piece for, what's the feeling?\n\nI have a hard time understanding why you're using Letter Gothic for body copy (unless it's short), but perhaps Franklin Gothic for titles? .... unless you're looking for contrast, in which case you the field is wide open. You could go with a fifties script, for example.\n\nYou might look at something like Unit, which has a broad range of weights, and could be used instead of Letter Gothic, and might be an improvement, IMHO.\n\n"
