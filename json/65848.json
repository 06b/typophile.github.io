In essence, you can add Buddies by clicking the link on their profile page. This allows you to track their activity in a more economical fashion.\n\nThe Flag feature is to empower all users to identify posts that require moderator attention. It goes into a central queue that the moderators will be watching. This is a more efficient way to manage the volume of content than the emails we get from time to time pointing out spammers in our midst. We'll be working to tuck the Flag link into the bottom right to keep it out of the way.\n\n"
