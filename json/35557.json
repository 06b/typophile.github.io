Any help is greatly appreciated!\n\nIt’s the “KLINE” font I’m having trouble with. It’s pretty close to MVB Magnesium, but it has uniform strokes, whereas MVB Magnesium has a combination of broad/narrow strokes.\n\nThe “construction” font is Times New Roman bold.\n\nThanks for any help you can offer!\n\n[URL=http://img58.imageshack.us/my.php?image=klineconstlogosmallxs0.png][IMG]http://img58.imageshack.us/img58/8157/klineconstlogosmallxs0.th.png[/IMG][/URL]\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [klinelogo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080125221305/http:/typophile.com/files/klinelogo.png) | 11.42 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) \"Dental Studio\" condensed sans - Solex {Marc O}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080125221305/http:/typophile.com/node/35573 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Name that script! - various {gang} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080125221305/http:/typophile.com/node/35310 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
