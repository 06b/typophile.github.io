  "content": "Hi all.   \n   \nI'm looking for a good source of animal illustrations that   \nlook like letterpress cuts, or rubberstamps (relatively thick   \nline art). Two examples of what I'm talking about are:   \n   \n [http://www.ing.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018033346/http:/www.ing.com/)   \n [http://www.brooksbrothers.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018033346/http:/www.brooksbrothers.com/)   \n   \nI've seen the cuts at Briar Press, similar, but are there other   \nsources for this kind of thing, pref. online?   \n   \nThanks,   \nRandy\n\n",
