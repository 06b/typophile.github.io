In this example it's a photograph of a tank and you have access to a 191 Megabytes TIFF.  \nMost of the images they put on flickr don't have restrictions on reproduction and publication.\n\n"

At least that's how I read it.\n\nIt is still use at your own risk, even if that risk is only 0.00001%.\n\n"
