  "content": "Now we've had the whole talk about getting what you pay for and everything, but my coworker really likes the Adobe Type font [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315072657/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003223) and wants to use if for her personal stationery. We have the font at work, but she wants to do it the honest way, just on a tight budget.\n\nCan anyone suggest a similar font with a not-so-similar price? Any suggestion is appreciated...\n\n",
