Unfortunately I haven't been able to google up a detailed picture, these one are the best I can find.  \nIt doesn't have to be the exact font, any similar sans serif will do.\n\n[http://home.germany.net/101-81660/keycode.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141126155407/http:/home.germany.net/101-81660/keycode.jpg \"http://home.germany.net/101-81660/keycode.jpg\")\n\n[http://home.germany.net/101-81660/randnum.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141126155407/http:/home.germany.net/101-81660/randnum.jpg \"http://home.germany.net/101-81660/randnum.jpg\")\n\n",
