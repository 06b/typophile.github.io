The en is a connecting dash; it represents a span of time or space. The em is a separating dash—to set apart a thought or idea. I do find that in some cases the em in particular is kerned too tight, but you can adjust those in the kerning tables (and I do).\n\n"

No space creates visual tension for me. Many fonts need the room to breathe. As Nick said, all of this depends on the font, as some dashes are longer than others and some have sidebearings with space, some do not.\n\nThe only hard and fast rule is that you must remain consistent in your use throughout a piece or brand.\n\nHey Patty - you just used a hypen with spaces when addressing Nick!

This is the kind of situation where \"following the rules\" will cause a typographer to do stuff which looks clumsy.  \nOn the other hand, Electra's em dash has plenty of sidebearings, i.e. built-in spaces.

Of course the average Joe doesn't look at the front and back cover of a book together to notice how nicely you've balanced and lined up the various elements either.

Typesetting is a lonely business but I come from book publishing, where this kind of thing matters. And I'm not dumbing down for the average Joe.\n\nOn a similar note, what is the deal with ellipses?

He says, \"Like the oversized space between sentences, it belongs to the padded and corsetted aesthetic of Victorian Typography.\" I remember the use of the spaced n-dash from my years in England, and it is part of Tschichold's recommended style for Penguin. I suspect it is in other English style books, but I don't have any on hand.\n\nFor dates, Bringhurst recommends en dashes without spaces, as is also American style, eg. in the Chicago Manual of Style.\n\nIf I remember rightly from earlier Typophile discussions, Matthew Carter came up with the idea of three-quarter em dashes with spaces out to the em. Being a 'mid Atlantic' kind of guy, I guess this is apt. I think it is probably the best solution. Kent Lew wrote that in Whitman he did the Carter-style em dashes and also negatively kerned them so if keyed in successively they make a solid line.\n\n"

The interesting thing is that you almost never see it being used today, i suspect exactly because it is deemed too long, as stated above. When used, you rarely see it without small 1/8th- to 1/4th-em spaces over here.  \nSeeing the em-dash in use as described today to me makes quite a traditional, if not ‘reactionary’ impression, like using the st-ligature in body copy, if you get my drift; but of course it depends on the typeface being used, context, etc. I find the en-dash sufficient in most cases.  \nApparently there is no reliable rule of thumb to be found here, as the design of both dashes varies too much from typeface to typeface.\n\n"
