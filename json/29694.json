      "content": "_Zwei Boxkämpfer jagen Eva quer durch Sylt._\n\nx, q and y are very rare letters in German. Luckily, there is the name of an island in the North Sea, _Sylt_. And a word we took from English: _boxen_, which means to box, and _Kämpfer_ means fighter, so the _Boxkämpfer_ is a boxer (boxing fighter). That also takes care of one Umlaut which is important in creating German-looking text. _Quer_ means across. There are too many l/c e, a and r to make this as efficient as the _quick brown fox_, but it is a fun sentence and easy to remember. If you're German.  \nWe have many more that are impossible to translate and difficult to remember, even for us.\n\n"

      "content": "So roughly it means:  \n<cite>Two boxers hunt across the Island of Sylt for Eva?</cite>  \nWho originally started using the phrase?\n\nIs it wrong for me to like **STRANGLE strangle**? Originally I just used RSTLNE like on Wheel of Fortune, but I wanted to see an A and a G. Then I wanted a word to arrange them in for my memory.\n\n(You could use \"strängle\" if you needed an Umlaut, but then that would be silly.)\n\n"
