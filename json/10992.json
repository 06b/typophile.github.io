I began this assignment thinking I would create a typeface that juxtaposed the disco era with hieroglyphics. After playing around with many different forms I noticed that they all had a \"space-like\" feel to them.   \n   \nDisco + Hierpgyphics = Spaceballs?   \n   \nsweet!   \n   \nBut now I need to name it, and I cant decide on a name at all.
