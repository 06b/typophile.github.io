I've been a fan of typophile for many years, but recently joined.\n\nI'm trying to find the typeface used in the poster for Woody Allen's Sleeper. An isolated version is attached, and you can view the original poster here:  \n [http://www.impawards.com/1973/sleeper\\_ver1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406024831/http:/www.impawards.com/1973/sleeper_ver1.html \"http://www.impawards.com/1973/sleeper\\_ver1.html\")\n\nThis could be completely custom, or at least I believe the swashes are. Any clues or guesses would be appreciated.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",
