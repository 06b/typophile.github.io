Virtually nobody has had the balls to consider that seriously.

Plus do note the “or something”. I don’t know the nature of the book Peter used a Bodoni for, or the true nature of his life, so... That said, frankly I do think he’s too Modernist; and setting Bodoni (justified?...) is one possible symptom of that.\n\nBTW:  \n\\> the contrast in Filosofia was toned down  \n\\> in order to make it more suitable for text.\n\nBut why even bother, if WRBWWRM? Just like with something like NotCaslon, the reader will get used to anything and everything after the first paragraph or something anyway, right?\n\nThe truth is: that was a good move; and Licko’s skills and understanding have -not surprisingly- improved over the years. Unfortunately what has been lacking is an admission that good craft matters after all; that even something as subtle as stroke contrast has an effect on the quality of the product. What has been lacking is a big fat asterisk on their mantra.\n\nhhp\n\n"

There are plenty of folks all too eager to kick science out of what they see as their ’creative space’.

Hrants point that Artists have been too eager to think ’I don’t need science’ or ’What I do isn’t touched by science, or can’t be helped by science’ is I think correct.

That’s a false boogeyman if ever there was one.\n\nI’m not so sure.  \nConsider what happened to newspaper text type in the 20th century, with corporate-technological concentration leading to a monopoly position for Linotype machines, combined with a “scientific” ideology of legibility directing font development. There wasn’t much choice of text faces, and that part of our culture became stagnant prior to Murdoch’s Augean cleansing.\n\nNow take a look at Microsoft’s ClearType faces. They’re a very close bunch designwise, from a combination of pre-design criteria that made it difficult for them to be otherwise. Some of that is the constraints of the technology leading to certain optimal forms, some of it — in particular the Greek and Cyrillic — is due to the conservative one-size-fits-all culture that globalized corporate concentration engenders. And some of it is design that panders to the “faster is better” aesthetic beloved of scientists and engineers.\n\nReductive design theories based on supposed scientific logic have been used as the basis of design reform for centuries. The engineering of real-world products always falls short, but that doesn’t stop the next generation of engineers saying “that was then, but we’ll get it right now. Pony up the cash and let’s get that Star Wars shield built pronto.”\n\nOne should also be aware of that progressive ethos in design where subtlety of execution is derided, where the preferred type is Arial, and the preferred logo is a square with the name knocked out. Here, artists are thinkers, not makers. This is a genuinely new paradigm, and if it leads to frankenomniuniversiclonetype, then perhaps that’s the way things are supposed to go in our MicroMacrAppleGooglAdobia future.\n\n"

The norm for contemporary Greek type for one remains that of Latinization, and the MS fonts go against that. In this case conservatism equates to Latinization.

I mean sure Arial & Verdana & eventaully the Cleartypes will dominate in the sense that they will be ’unfairly’ ubiquitous. But there is more choice now than there has ever been & that is set to keep improving.

That’s what happened in the 70s to Greek. Please stop.\n\nA society based on wants is exactly what’s sending the world downhill of late.\n\n\\> I trust my emotions (I’ve been practising for a while, so hopefully  \n\\> I’ve developed some useful design instincts), and try and make the  \n\\> type read as well as possible.\n\nBut it is exactly without Science that you can’t strike a good balance between the two. Myself, I have faith that based on what [I think] users need (not merely want) and guided by Science (although not the formal western definition of it) my self-expression will result in useful things.\n\nThere’s a difference between trusting one’s emotions (which everybody does to some extent, but nobody should do absolutely) versus guiding one’s self-expression towards serving others. I’ve been making fonts -for other people- for over 20 years now, but I still try to look upon my emotions from the “outside” instead of getting drunk on them - I feel that’s the key to being a reasonable world citizen.\n\nhhp\n\n"

What Greek-font-buyers have you interviewed, and what market research\\*\\* have you carried out? Also: Did you base Albany on any such thing, or did you base it instead on a desire to exercise internally-consistent formalist shape-making, leading off directly from the Latin master that you so emotionally... painted?\n\n\\* Yes, just want, for the sake of argument.\n\n\\*\\* Of course you’d have to do the research yourself, only a clueless idiot would rely on the research of others, right?\n\nhhp\n\n"

My complaint is that font bundling by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe is unfair to independent foundries. Perhaps their behavior is inevitable, because nobody is powerful enough to stop them.\n\nBTW, I agree with you that there is lots of opportunity for good work, and there is a strong market for indie fonts. The narrow focus of the ClearType fonts should leave space for other foundries to fill. So it is not all doom and gloom. But for the mainstream of font users who don’t buy indie fonts, it’s homogenous typography — no matter how good the type design and how sharp the image.\n\nHrant, your most recent post (11.18) was much more polite and intelligent, and I’m tempted to reply, but I’m not going to continue the discussion, because from past experience I know that you would soon again resort to personal attacks (eg 11.35).\n\n"
