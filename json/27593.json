Of course I blame planet\\_embroidery for starting the cat comments ;-)\n\nI’ve been trying to work out the nine lives of Comma, which I guess he didn’t (she didn’t, it didn’t) have after all. I get _Period_, _Comma_, _Semi-colon_, _Colon_, _Ellipsis_… then maybe _Exclamation Point_, _Question Mark_, _Interrobang_, and then what?.. that’s only eight lives\n\n"

Comma was almost called ‘Mrs Eaves’, which I think would be a great name for a cat, but as he was a boy that whole ‘Mrs’ bit just didn’t sit right.\n\nKen - I definitely think that ‘Period’ would have to be the final life, although as he was an Australian cat, it’d really have to be ‘full stop’. :-) Oh, and I think a hypen would round out your punctuation set nicely.\n\n"
