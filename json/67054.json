  "content": "Hello Typophiles! It's been a while since I lurked these corridors, but I have a slight query at work and would like to ask your opinions if I may.\n\nBeen given a re-branding project at work, its nothing enormous, but it revolves around fashion and extreme sports. We are building a new website, product photography, the whole shebang.\n\nTo cut the long story short, the owners want the brand to be different, but not too different. The brand 'Typeface' being a horrid font by the name of 'Aggie'. Anyway. It has to go.\n\nSo I need rid of Aggie, and the replacement needs to resemble it in some fashion but drag it out of 2002. If that is at all possible.\n\nI found two potentials, one called Korataki, which serves nicely despite the terrible caps 'K' that resembles a decapitated stick man. Its an improvement at least.\n\nThen I found 'Sone' which is really fresh, plenty of weights, Could be used as body type also, but, alas, not the most imposing or effective when it comes to Logo type.\n\nThing is, that remains to be seen as need to decide what to purchase, I don't want to flex company plastic at both only to find neither efficient or effective.\n\nI thought one of you might be able to pluck a solution out of obscurity, would love to know what you think.\n\nThanks! Tom.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen shot 2010-02-05 at 17.22.17.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013234524/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-02-05%20at%2017.22.17.png) | 429.08 KB |\n| [Screen shot 2010-02-05 at 17.36.40.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013234524/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-02-05%20at%2017.36.40.png) | 292.27 KB |\n| [Screen shot 2010-02-05 at 17.26.50.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013234524/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-02-05%20at%2017.26.50.png) | 182.04 KB |\n\n",
