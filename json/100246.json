  "content": "I need help!  \nI'm creating a website/social networking resource and I am designing a logo. I found a font that I like for free from a website and want to use just one letter \"s\" for my logo. I will not be selling the logo or distributing the font in any way, just want to have a clean logo for my website/potentially more than that in the future.\n\n1) can I do this?  \n2) can I customize the logo in photoshop or something and tweak it to make it original and use that?  \n3)if not, what steps do I need to take in order to do this legitimately?\n\nAny help or advice would be extremely appreciated guys!\n\n",

The thing is, when you use a font for something that represents you (as opposed to a client) that might count as \"personal use\" (as opposed to \"commercial use\"). But it depends how the designer sees the situation, and it's always good to get an OK in writing.\n\nhhp\n\n"
