  "content": "Hi,  \nI have an old 'work in progress' font that contains Latin, Greek and Cyrillic glyphs created by an old colleage who has since passed over, and it has class kerning values assigned inside the font, however, no glyphs have been assigned to the class set, using Font Forge to create an FEA file, I can see the following under GPOS:\n\n@kc4\\_first\\_1 = [];  \n @kc4\\_first\\_2 = [];  \n @kc4\\_first\\_3 = [];  \n @kc4\\_first\\_4 = [];  \n @kc4\\_first\\_5 = [];  \n ................. thru to  \n @kc4\\_first\\_180 = [];  \n @kc4\\_first\\_181 = [];  \n @kc4\\_first\\_182 = [];  \n @kc4\\_first\\_183 = [];  \n @kc4\\_first\\_184 = [];\n\n@kc4\\_second\\_1 = [];  \n @kc4\\_second\\_2 = [];  \n @kc4\\_second\\_3 = [];  \n @kc4\\_second\\_4 = [];  \n @kc4\\_second\\_5 = [];  \n------------------- thru to  \n @kc4\\_second\\_170 = [];  \n @kc4\\_second\\_171 = [];  \n @kc4\\_second\\_172 = [];  \n @kc4\\_second\\_173 = [];  \n @kc4\\_second\\_174 = [];\n\nthen\n\npos @kc4\\_first\\_1 @kc4\\_second\\_34 31;  \n pos @kc4\\_first\\_1 @kc4\\_second\\_38 102;  \n pos @kc4\\_first\\_1 @kc4\\_second\\_97 31;  \n.................... thru to  \n pos @kc4\\_first\\_184 @kc4\\_second\\_164 -41;  \n pos @kc4\\_first\\_184 @kc4\\_second\\_165 -51;  \n pos @kc4\\_first\\_184 @kc4\\_second\\_168 -92;  \n pos @kc4\\_first\\_184 @kc4\\_second\\_171 -92;  \n pos @kc4\\_first\\_184 @kc4\\_second\\_172 195;  \n pos @kc4\\_first\\_184 @kc4\\_second\\_174 -123;\n\nI am wondering, is there a way to work out what the constituent members of the class settings would be? I do have a list of the glyphs from GDEF table. That probably sounds silly, but I would like to finish the font and pass it back to his family.\n\n",
