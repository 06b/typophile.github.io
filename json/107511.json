So I am new on the forum and on font-making ; I believed it would be an interesting way to get a better understanding of fonts thru designing it (and eventually make me a better designer... ahah...hum...).\n\nSo here is the firsts \"drafts\", I actually finished the small caps, but quite frankly not yet satisfied with the looks of some of them (and it does take me a damn long time for each letter). So here is it and feel free to give some opinions on that...\n\nMy idea was to create a serif font with a certain classic style but usable for designers and/or average people. Not quite there yet, but heh, have to start somewhere :)\n\n[img]http://uppix.net/1zkcTm.jpg[/img]\n\n",
