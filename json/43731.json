  "content": "Okay, I'm sure I know this one, but it has gotten lost somewhere in my memory... It's the italic sans used in ReadyMade, and it has a double-story a, a semi-slab on the i, and the f drops below the baseline. It's _almost_ like Officina Sans Italic or Corpid Office Italic, except for that a. Anyone?\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [instore300\\_fplan1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021051825/http:/typophile.com/files/instore300_fplan1.gif) | 5.38 KB |\n| [instore300\\_tote1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021051825/http:/typophile.com/files/instore300_tote1.gif) | 4.28 KB |\n\n",
