(Minneapolis Star Tribune commissioned the initial styles.) The x-ht/extender proportions are a little more classical than some other recent news headletter styles and might be an easier transition from Garamond (if that's important).\n\nThe fonts haven't yet been put up for Retail download on Font Bureau's website, but they are available for license by contacting FB directly.\n\nYou can see samples at my site: [http://www.kentlew.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415212710/http:/www.kentlew.com/ \"http://www.kentlew.com\").\n\nAlso, there's a PDF showing available (not linked on the site) here: [http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay\\_Sample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415212710/http:/www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay_Sample.pdf \"http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay\\_Sample.pdf\")\n\n\\</self-promotion\\>\n\n-- Kent.\n\n"
