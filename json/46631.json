  "content": "I am wondering who designed the original SPIN Magazine logo? The old original logo has slightly rounded corners, while the updated version, which is almost exact has sharp modern edges. Anyone know the typeface which this is based off of, if it is indeed custom which I believe to be so.\n\nThanks,\n\nAGM\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150101032231im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OLD-SPIN-LOGO_4715.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I can't say this for sure, especially given the form of that S, but I work for some folks who were behind the start of SPIN. They have very strict rules about type, and I'm fairly certain that this is Akzindenz Grotesk or DIN Schrift. The S, as I said, looks modified, but those two faces are used on the logos of many of the magazines that have fallen under the ownership of the Guccione family (which started SPIN).\n\n"
