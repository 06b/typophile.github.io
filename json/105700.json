The text is poorly rendered, the stars are poorly rendered, the fine line segments which is meant to connect those elements isn't even of the same radius ...even it's poorly rendered. The cake part of the cupcake looks like a turd and gets lost in the background color. Those branches whatever are incredibly lame.\n\nThere's nothing distinctive in this 'logo' worth paying for ...except of course how poorly it's designed.\n\nBut I kinda like the color palette ...\n\n"
