It works, I promise.   \n   \nHow are you going to use your typeface design? If its going to be anything but display sizes or in print I'm afraid the subtitle details will fill in and be lost. Try to always think of the end use of your designs.\n\n"

For example, if you look at the bottom of the small side table you posted, they have squarish 'feet' that break the straight line of the leg.   \n   \nThe ends of the strokes here look 'naked' to me, and call for something like the treatment of the feet of the table, to be consistent with the style.\n\n"
