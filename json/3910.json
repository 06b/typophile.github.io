  "content": "Hello to the board!   \n   \nI always wondered during the last days what kind of entry present I could offer to the typophile community. Well, I just had been working on a logo for a mineral water and the client (like always) took one of those alternatives I did not really favorise. So I sadly looked at MY best version, my darling, meditated over it for some minutes and suddenly saw that there could be some glyphs hidden in the geometry. Mmmmh, I thought, I can also WRITE with it (if one can read it is another question)...   \n   \nNow I want to present the result to your critical eyes: a desktop in two sizes (1,280 and 1,024) that I will upload to the desktop gallery. In case it does not arrive there or gets delayed somehow, everybody can also see it and download it from my homepage in   \n [1280](http://web.archive.org/www.matthiasnicolai.com/code1280.html) or [1024](http://web.archive.org/www.matthiasnicolai.com/code1024.html) format.   \n   \nI truelly look forward to your feedback but have a bit mercy with a design newby like me.   \n   \nTHANKS. MAT\n\n",
