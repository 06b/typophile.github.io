However, coming across free vectors is like finding gold dust.\n\nIn my moment of despiration, I turn to you typophiles in search of some eclectic vector formats for use in print.\n\nRegards,\n\nPaul.\n\n [‹ Extending Adobe Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106234519/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37347 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [CV and Portfolio - for entry level designer ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106234519/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37293 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
