The thing that I’m finding, however, is that if I extend the Q character one additional pixel, the cross-bar [at the corner] appears ’aesthetically correct’, even though the two characters are now proportionally distinct.\n\nI guess then, I’m wondering if anyone can offer their feedback - opinions toward to what extent should we feel it necessary to break certain rules in favor of the aesthetic? Or, would making such changes be a severe no-no in your opinions?\n\nAnd - in referencing some typefaces that are centuries old - it appears that a distinct Q was often used that was non-proportional to the O character. Thus, is there really a ’rule’ afterall, if one can reference typography of the past?\n\n(Perhaps I’m over-thinking this issue?)\n\n [‹ Pixel Font from Illustrator to FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821144338/http:/www.typophile.com/node/9586 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Alternatives to The Mix / The Serif? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821144338/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34541 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’ve been killing myself over trying to determine whether to go with my gut intuition in this case and stick with the aesthetic that was ’working’ - or conceed to the ’rules’.\n\nOne of the environmental procedures I’ve been incorporating in the testing phases of these typefaces - is to use them in a Win 98 theme. (Yes, I’m Windoze.) That’s really where I noticed the extent that it works in this particular face - though, it disturbed me no end!\n\n"

Unfortunately, I located someone beginning to ’rip’ where I was going with the typefaces - whom was located through my analytics on my site. I don’t care to point fingers at people - I just take down the demonstrations as a result of anothers’ apparent unoriginality.\n\nIt’s a shame that some people do that. Then again, I should probably have learned by now that this is the type of thing that can happen as a result of being open and demonstrating progress. It kind of saps the fun out of it, if you know what I mean.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you, Ricardo. The original production versions were posted in a Flash file, with logged dates in the process. I’m not particularly concerned with that aspect of it. What I am concerned with, is potentially having gone a particular ’original’ route that can easily become modified by others. At this time, I don’t see it being necessary to post an example as it was primarily a research study question.\n\nTo update on that research progress, however, I spent the last few days digging centuries back in the etymology of the ’O’ glyph form. As it turns out, the ’O’ is a very modern representation that’s only more modernly depicted with the ’Q’ character’s geometry. In proper English and in the Western / North-American and in various Latin cultures, for instance — the modern ’O’ (or ’o’) can be considered somewhat of a ’bastardization’ of pronounciations — thus, making it a highly subjective glyph.\n\nThough, I do understand the need for ’balancing’ the ’O’ with the ’Q’ for most aesthetic reasons — I’ve come away with this subtle bit of historical information that has enlightened me to a certain extent as to how I wish to proceed.\n\nI’ll post examples eventually, of course. Don’t mean to be a poopy-head about it. Just that it turned into something rather ’important’ for me at this time.\n\n"
