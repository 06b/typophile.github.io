For a beginning or end of word it helps to use a lookup along with classes for letters.\n\nExample:\n\n@Letters = all letters except space\n\nfeature clig {  \n lookup clig\\_dsend {  \n ignore sub d' s' @Letters;  \n sub d' s' space by d\\_s.end;  \n } clig\\_dsend;\n\n"

Set 1 for Ill/InDes, Set 2 for XPress etc.\n\nThanks for any insight,  \nAdrian\n\n"

You can have both salt and SS features with the same substitutions.\n\n(I believe FontLab has an example of the exact syntax for Stylistic sets ... it is not hard to write.)\n\nRecompile, write off, (purge older version of the font) and and turn on SS01 in Word.\n\n"
