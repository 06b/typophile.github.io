  "content": "Today, through Firefox I changed the default font for displaying Armenian texts on the web from Mshtakan to Segoe UI (I have a Mac). So far there haven't been any problems with Armenian websites, however on facebook (see imege below) the lowercase letters |ր| and |դ| of Segoe UI are being replaced with the letters |ր| and |դ| from Verdana. Not that I mind it, but I'm very curious as to why is this happening. (On Typophile too, these letters are being replaced from Segoe UI to Verdana.)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225000943im_/http:/typophile.com/files/rehverdana_4330.png)\n\nAlso, is there a way of changing the defult fonts for displaying Armenian through the Mac System on Snow leopard, as well as on the keyboard viewer. Thank you.\n\n",
