If you know of any resources that feature Palatino, or have some of your own, I'd be very appreciative if you'd be willing to post those here to help me collect a number of examples. Outside of specimen sheets it can really be anything - signage, posters, book text, on-screen use, etc.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",

It was an AAUP Book Show selection in 2003. Details:\n\n<cite>The Cast of Character</cite>  \nNancy Worman  \nUniversity of Texas Press\n\ntrim size: 6 × 9 in; pages: 288  \ntext: 9.75/14 Palatino × 27 pc  \ndisplay face: Syntax  \nbook design: Heidi Haeuser\n\nCategory: scholarly typographic  \nJudges’ comments: This book works in a lot of ways: the two-color jacket is strong; the combination of Palatino and Syntax seems exactly right for the topic and the format; and the page size is very pleasant in the hand. (kf) I feel the type ornament is too dominant (perhaps it would have been more effective screened back), but the use of Palatino and its accompanying Greek font is to be applauded. (cz)\n\n"
