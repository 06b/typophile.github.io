I have attached two logo designs, the first, my chosen one. The second, the client suggested this idea.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, which works best, if any!\n\nb\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [yourthoughts.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023143032/http:/typophile.com/files/yourthoughts.pdf) | 90.57 KB |\n\n",

Look at what the client had to  \nwork with for inspiration! :-/\n\nAlso, \"modern clean\" isn't what it used to be.\n\n--\n\nFrankly this all sounds like the typical case of a graphic artist (second word chosen with intent...) making a final decision, and showing it off simply hoping that people will cheer, and when they don't, ignoring the problem. I do hope I'm wrong though.\n\nhhp\n\n"
