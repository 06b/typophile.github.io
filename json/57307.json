  "content": "Hi!  \nI´m looking for a font similar to the font used in the Campagnolo-logo.  \nAnyone know the name of the font they use? Or do you have a suggestion for something similar?  \nI kind of like [www.dafont.com/ballpark-weiner.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150325212535/http:/www.dafont.com/ballpark-weiner.font \"www.dafont.com/ballpark-weiner.font\")  \nBut I need something that feels more \"strict\" and have more of a feeling of speed.  \nAny suggestions?  \nthanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [campa\\_logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150325212535/http:/typophile.com/files/campa_logo.jpg) | 96.5 KB |\n\n",
