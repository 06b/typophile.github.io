  "content": "I'm looking for a typeface that comes in heavy weights, and has echoes of Gotham black (strong, authoritative but unpretentious), but isn't Gotham. A bit warmer, perhaps with subtly rounded corners, or perhaps a bit more condensed. Still basically geometrical though.\n\nThis is mainly for a logo, probably all-caps.\n\nNeutra would be a possibility, except there are two Ns in the logo and the sharp-angled Neutra N isn't the feel I'm going for here.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",
