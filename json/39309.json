It appears more “square” when compared to Futura or Helvetica. The “square” parts of it are the counters and the bowls, but still, like I said is only has the subtle nuance of “square-ness.”  \nAlso, [DIN](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051733/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_din_ot_bold/) might fall into this as well.\n\nIf you are looking for a square typeface might want to try:\n\n[Square Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051733/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/square_721_bold/)  \n [Eurostile](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051733/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/eurostile_lt_std_bold_ot/)\n\nThese faces are as far as you can get before moving into perfectly geometric characters or “techno” fonts (I hate using that term as a classification):\n\n[Agency](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051733/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/agency_bold/)  \n [Bank Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051733/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/bank_gothic_medium/) - small caps\n\n"
