This goes way back to 1971 and so it is pre-digital. I've flicked through all my old Letraset references, and nada, zip, zilch zero - nothing leaps out.\n\nIf you're really stuck, you could always ask the record company. I know it's no longer owned by David Geffen, or Elektra, but it was relaunched about 10 years ago by Warner Bros.  \nYou could send a tweet.  \n [https://twitter.com/AsylumRecs](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829103026/https:/twitter.com/AsylumRecs \"https://twitter.com/AsylumRecs\")\n\nI should know this and I'll kick myself when I find out what it is.\n\n"
