  "content": "Hi,  \nI know fontlab is buggy, but this one is new to me. Whenever I click through the “editing layers” palette (the standard view with the 5 main layers) after a couple of clicks one or another layer locks up. Then I have to switch into the “advanced” layer section and unlock the layers. Its a pain!\n\nMy guess is that something in the pref files has been messed up, but i dont really want to reset them since all my customized settings would be lost, too. The same would be the case with reinstalling FontLab.\n\nAny advice anyone?\n\nThanks  \nHenning\n\n [‹ Help!
