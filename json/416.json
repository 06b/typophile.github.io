My first idea was to to have a fixed on every letter. But that doesn't seem to work.   \n   \nAny solutions?\n\n",

Keep it simple.   \nI like the pointy-left-under-thingy (what is it called anyway?). Use it also for the \"a\" and \"b\". With that you can make a really nice font. It will look like leafs from a tree.   \n   \nKeep it up. I'm looking forward for the numerals.   \n   \nRen\n\n"
