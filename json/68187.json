  "content": "Finally I have decided to publish the fruit of my labour on MyFonts. The result for now is yet another version of Baskerville Old Face but with the added suffixes ”KTKM” and ”Display” (Baskerville Old Face KTKM-Display).\n\nI wanted to improve the contrast between thick and thin, reduce some ink-traps and give stems, serifs and links a smoother overall feel. I have also added some alternative letters, ligatures and old style numerals.\n\nFeedback is highly appreciated.\n\nBest regards,  \nKristian Möller\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817073813im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bof_ktkm-art002_6603.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817073813im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bof_ktkm-art004_3707.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817073813im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bof_ktkm-art007_6479.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817073813im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bof_ktkm-art006_5254.png)\n\n",
