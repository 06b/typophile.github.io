  "content": "Hi everyone\n\nI've been reading and learning allot here on the forum and today decided to join in, i'm a first year graphic design student and was wondering if maybe someone here could help me out on \"how to\" do a retro or old style kind of effect in indesign.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009102745im_/http:/typophile.com/files/nedwright6_5195.jpg)\n\ni tried doing this with type on path but i get a completely different look, here it looks as if the type is already slanted and put on a path (maybe?) I'm really still figuring allot of Indesign out and learning as i go, really hope you fine people could give me some good pointers on how to achieve this effect\n\nAlso if someone knows witch font is being used that would be cherry's on top\n\nAppreciate all the help!!\n\n",

      "content": "To help illustrate what is going on let's rotate the text back to a straight line for a moment. As you'll see the text is 'skewed' to the right... in this case 20 degrees. After the skew has been applied the text block is rotated 20 degrees to match the skew angle. This will keep the vertical alignment of the type at 90 degrees while producing the results you desire.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009102745im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Press-Tutorial_5788.gif)\n\n"
