  "content": "[New to graphic design] I really like serifed fonts for, of course, their legibility. I also like Trade Gothic as a label typeface for its simplicity. I've been pairing it with Perpetua, because I have it, but it seems very obvious, very vanilla. If I were going to invest in some new pairings for Trade Gothic, what would you recommend? Why? (i use Perpetua because it seems like a standard pairing, and it seems--to my untrained eye--like some of their strokes compliment one another). Thanks!\n\n",
