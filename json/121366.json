  "content": "Greetings folks. I hope this isn't entirely off topic for the ID forum.\n\nI found this sans serif on dafont.com that I really love: [http://www.dafont.com/bn-pinky.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211849/http:/www.dafont.com/bn-pinky.font) Although it is free to use, the TTF files themselves appear to be restricted for conversion, which means I cannot use them for my website as I had hoped.\n\nI was wondering if any of you respected experts might be able to suggest a typeface that is similar in feel to BN Pinky?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211849im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bn_pinky_6048.png)\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n",

To me, it looks like some sort of [DIN](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211849/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/din) Condensed (Mono)/ [Isononorm](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211849/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/isonorm). As you're apparently after a font for web-purpose only, here some in the same vein and I'm sure they can be used for your website (main difference on /R leg): [Miso](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211849/http:/www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Miso), [Dosis](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211849/http:/www.impallari.com/dosis), [Static](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211849/http:/fontfabric.com/static-free-font), [Melbourne](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211849/http:/26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/melbourne)\n\n"
