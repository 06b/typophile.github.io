The community has been very helpful and I'd appreciate one more question:\n\nThis time, I'm trying to find a font that looks similar to the twix font\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120228130631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/twix.jpg)\n\nI'm sure the logo itself was done as an in-house custom job, but if anyone could recommend a font that looks similar, I would definitely appreciate it. I've been searching online for quite some time and haven't come across anything yet.\n\nThanks!  \n-Brian\n\n",
