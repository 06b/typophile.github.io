Twentieth Century is indeed a Futura knock-off or adaptation, but Avant Garde is to me quite different in feel. It is generally wider, has much shorter ascenders, and has the distinctive very wide CG and ce --which to me are hideous, but that's beside the point.\n\n"

Heller's articles mentioned by David are titled aggressive and I would love to obtain a copy (if possible).\n\n\"Herbert Bayer\" looks visually an ancestor of \"ITC Bauhaus\".\n\nMy cause for the question is the image below, which I suspect is a postwar faked stamp on a military jacket.\n\n[http://www.history.jp/images/gebpolrgt18.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320132944/http:/www.history.jp/images/gebpolrgt18.jpg)\n\nLooks similar to Avant Garde but certainly \"R\" and \"1\" is different. Thus the query.\n\n"

To quote Mac McGrew (referring to the metal version): \"Twentieth Century is Monotype's copy of Futura, and in display sizes is essentially an exact copy, while composition sized are only slightly modified.\" If you showed both faces side by side with no labels, I doubt if anyone could tell which was which. The only obvious difference I can see are the quote marks. I could accept Vogue, which is more geometric and monoline than either Futura or Twentieth Century, as a more likely influence on Avant Garde.\n\n"

      "content": "The Bauhaus-guys were really into using ‘building blocks’, which accounts for the geometric look of a lot of their products. Historically the use of geometric forms goes back to the days of Albrecht Dürer, but in the case of sans serif more specifically to the golden age of lithography (the latter half of the 19th century).\n\nLithographic artists used books with samples of lettering where the more modern forms of lettering (sans) were often based upon geometric forms. A later pendant for this are the guides for painters (meant are house painters who often doubled as sign painters) who were also trained in painting letterforms starting out with geometric forms. I have seen samples in the historic village of Enkhuizen in the NL. And there are also sample books in the same lieu for stone masons, architects and so on.\n\n. . . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"
