Times Roman by Linotype in Type 1 format is one font, Times Cyrillic Regular by Linotype in Type 1 format is another font, Times Roman Std by Adobe in OpenType format is another font, Dutch 801 Roman by Bitstream in Type 1 format is another font — all of the same typeface Times Roman.  \nBefore scalable type, there was little distinction between the terms font, typeface, and [family](http://web.archive.org/web/20140119112623/http:/typophile.com/wiki/family). Font and typeface still tend to be used interchangeably, although the term typeface is usually more correct.\n\nIn television production, \"font\" refers to information, such as a location or a person's name, electronically superimposed on the screen (hence the more common \"super\"). Also used as a verb: \"How should we font this guy?\" \"You supered him 'convicted criminal;' he's actually the DA.\"\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Type Terminology: Systems? Suites?
