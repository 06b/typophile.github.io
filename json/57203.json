  "content": "Hello everyone, I'm currently working on a new project and I'm having trouble making a decision. What do you think about these logos? It's for a snowboard company who is also selling downhill skateboard. I want to make two logos, one with the all \"Pumpkin\" word and another small one as a symbol.\n\nAny kind of critics are welcome...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Image 53.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20120418221106/http:/typophile.com/files/Image%2053.png) | 45.13 KB |\n\n",

The choice is hard between the straight and the rounded edges one (1 and 3).\n\nI really like number 2 and I'm trying to make the white and black holes look better. For example the inside of the \"P\" and the black on top of the intersection of \"P\" and \"K\".\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks all of you for your comments. About that project: I'm studying Graphic Design in Brussels and this is my final project. I'm going to do their new identity, website, packaging, boards graphics... the all thing.\n\nYou can check their two website here:  \n [http://www.cloud-9.ch/schneebretter/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120418221106/http:/www.cloud-9.ch/schneebretter/index.html \"http://www.cloud-9.ch/schneebretter/index.html\")  \n [http://www.cloud-9.ch/rollbretter/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120418221106/http:/www.cloud-9.ch/rollbretter/index.html \"http://www.cloud-9.ch/rollbretter/index.html\")\n\nCurrently they have two logos for one brand and I think one logo for the all \"Pumpkin\" brand suits better. About what Will said, I'm aware of that but their skateboards are slalom and downhill skateboards, often used on mountains and hills. I tried to put skate and snow in one logo (#2).\n\nI like the rounded one too, but it doesn't really fit when I'm using it as the symbol \"PK\" #3.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120418221106im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pk_4594.png)\n\n"

(although the contrast between the two doesn't bother me so much) You may want to re-think your symbol. A mountain range would be good for ski/snowboard manufacturer but for a Skateboard/snowboard manufacturer? Looks like you are ignoring half of the clientele. after Re-reading your original post stating you want 2 designs, a word mark and a symbol. I'm wondering are they going to be used for the different products? And while I like the look of the mark, it's starting to bother me the more I think about it, why PK? Does anyone abbreviate pumpkin PK?\n\n"

      "content": "Hey Kirsten, thanks for your comment, it's always good to get different opinion.\n\nI understand what you mean with the skate/snow manufacturer, and I'm aware of that. But as I said above, those skateboards are often used for speed and downhill. Those guys wear leather and helmet riding down mountains at incredible speed... That's why I think the mountain symbol isn't far from that kind of skateboarding.\n\nI'm still thinking about that option because as you said I don't want to ignore half of the clientele. And it's true not everybody rides skateboards in mountains.\n\nI'm still in the early process of the logo so I'm trying things, that's why I came up with that PK. Maybe I could try to use the whole Pumpkin word and the mountain symbol without the PK. I know PK is not the abbreviation of Pumpkin, it's just an option to make a symbol out of the brand.\n\n@epsilicon  \nDo you mean I should make the P and the N look like skateboard or snowboard edges?\n\n"

I think the logo you currently have is better suited for the first group, the second one is a bit more 'high tech', think 'nano-tube carbon-fiber'.\n\nIf you need the opinion of more people in the 'scene' try the forums of Silverfish Longboarding (the largest online community on longboarding).\n\nJust a heads up; Pumpkin is already a name in use for a type of bushings made by Bear (subdivision of Landyachtz).\n\n"
