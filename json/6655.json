      "content": "I think there are two fonts here. The all-caps lettering looks like Zapf's Aldus, which is similar to Palatino, but without the serif on the arm of the F.   \n   \nThe other font looks a bit like Palatino in the half serifs on the h and n. The other letters are quite different from Palatino, or any other Zapf fonts I looked at. The s is particularly odd with the missing lower serif.   \n   \nI am still looking into this one.\n\n"
