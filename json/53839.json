But I must say that if I saw these two logos, and wouldn't know what either of them is, I would in fact assume these two companies are affiliated, without any mean thoughts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018081545im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pixelmatrix_3607.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018081545im_/http:/typophile.com/files/designbits_5031.png)\n  \n_\"I can’t see any similarity between the pixelmedia logo and my version, except that both contain pixels.\"_\n\n1) In both logos, the central idea is how the pixel mark plays with negative space  \nto \"reveal\" the initial letter of the company's name.\n\n2) Both logos include said pixelated mark; the company's name in all lc;  \nand a subline in all UC.\n\n3) The layout / order (Anordnung) of these elements is extremely similar.  \nThe pixel mark appears on the left; brand name to the right of it, more or less horizontally centered; subline below that, flush right. Even the size relations  \nare pretty similar.  \nIf you think of the gazillions of ways the individual elements of a logotype  \ncan be arranged, this similarity in layout _is_ surprising. Have you tried laying out your logo in a different way? Making the pixel mark larger, centering the brand name under it – or any of the numerous other options out there?\n\n4) You're obviously also trying to get the type to feel pretty much similar as in the original, which needless to say does a lot for their \"visual closeness\".\n\n5) From a copywriting perspective, the subline follows the exact same logic (Design / Web Design), which probably makes these two logos feel even more like being for two subsets of the same company.\n\n6) It doesn't help dissuade the notion of overt similarity that you chose very similar colors to the original logo (dark blue background, white type in the brand name, and the same color for the most part of the pixel mark and the subline, thus tying these two elements together).\n\nI'm just suspecting you may be glued to this \"inspirational\" logo too closely. Break free, play around! The pixelmatrix logo is nice, doubtless – but you're a different company.  \nNo offense.\n\n"
