A grey for the black might soften it a bit and separate it from the ’80s—but you know what you are going for and how you want it to look.\n\nYou have a repeat image in the HP print piece.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the comments guys. I think the grey could be a great option. Know what you mean about the f’s now you say it. I guess my thought was that I just wanted to design it unrestrained and not be held back by anything. I thought that as its a website, nothing else, not a company I didnt have to brand the name at all, and legibility was not that important in terms of logos or anything. I was quite influenced by RayGun music magazine. The whole form over function thingy. But I think I definetely need to work on the large F a bit.\n\nWordpress indeed. Im knid of new to blogging actually, as you may have guessed :-)  \nam just figuring it out by reading forums. Will work on the comments.  \nthanks so much for the comments again.\n\n"

Not to keen on that now that I see in your portfolio what you can do, but its a straight up nice and easy website. Easy to figure out so I don’t waste time on finding my way around - which is very cool.  \nOne more thing. The big fat outline you have on the images in your portfolio kind really irritates my eye - without them - your portfolio would look nice, light and simply and easy to digest.  \nLooking forward to you blog though...\n\n"

I get people all the time that pick up the phone and contact me right away.
