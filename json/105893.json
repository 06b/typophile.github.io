      "content": "Hi,  \nThat's a really good one - it's part of the Partizan Belgrade Soccer Team logo.  \nI would imagine that it's a custom job that only consists of those letters and not available as a regular font.\n\nAnyhow if you require scalable vectors of the complete logo then get my .eps version from here:  \n [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37241705/PartizanBelgrade.eps](http://web.archive.org/web/20140606123654/https:/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37241705/PartizanBelgrade.eps \"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37241705/PartizanBelgrade.eps\")  \nor if you want it here's a pdf copy:  \n [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37241705/PartizanBelgrade.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140606123654/https:/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37241705/PartizanBelgrade.pdf \"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37241705/PartizanBelgrade.pdf\")\n\nIt reminds me those crazy neon fonts in the old Letraset catalogue, Oxford, Uptight Neon, Yagi Link Double etc., but check out:  \n [http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide03.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140606123654/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide03.html \"http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide03.html\")  \nwhere you may find something similar (or maybe not)  \nGood Hunting.\n\nRegards  \nDoghouse Studio\n\n"
