      "content": "The Ambigrammatic is interesting. Looks like they devised a single letter ambigram form for every pair of letters in the alphabet (including the same letter), then the program looks at the string(s) you provide and looks up the corresponding ambigram form for each pair of letters (right-side-up and up-side-down) and displays the ambigram. Crude, but effective in a rather mechanical way. Not all of the forms work real well.\n\nI just designed [an ambigram for a client](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170736/http:/www.marksimonson.com/images/revelation-big.gif) who is going to use it for a tattoo. They’re not easy, but can be fun (ambigrams, I mean).\n\n[John Langdon](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170736/http:/www.johnlangdon.net/) is the master of this particular art form.\n\n"

I feel that overall it needs more work on it to be effective. Also there is a missed opportunity (or built in redundancy) in the treatment of the title, in that it does nothing to support the rotational/reflective aspect of the ambigram.  \nTim\n\n"

The rest, particularly the t, was trickier.\n\nI agree with you about the McCartney solution. It feels weak, like they went so far and gave up. I don’t know that I could have done better (having not attempted it), but it does seem like it could be better. Anybody know who did it?\n\n"

It is quite a responsibility designing something as permanent as a tattoo, ultimately I took the opinion that the client’s know their minds and own their bodies.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "Hey Tim, thx. I emailed you, btw.  \n\\> was that part of the briefs or your reaction to the problem?\n\nI’d say ’reaction to problem’ or ’reaction to puzzle’. More often than not, clients need to be gently educated on the benefits of a custom mark vs. something done in a font. So if a brief exists, hopefully for us, it’s a broad call to solve the puzzle with a custom lettering solution.  \n Thus, the lettering journey — from sketchbook musings, to illustrator doodles, to pleasing the client with a final piece — becomes an invigorating exercise in problem solving. It doesn’t always happen like that, but we can dream, eh? (sorry, I know this is preaching to the choir.) :D\n\n"
