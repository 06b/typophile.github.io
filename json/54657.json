I regard Sabio as an evolutionary face. By this I mean that it merges elements of script and Roman design into one elegant whole.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014125624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Sabio_Poster_4214.png)\n\nThe design was ‘evolved’ somewhere between these two classic approaches. The resulting family of faces makes an excellent display family, but is also clear and legible at small sizes and can be used as a text face with a distinctive flair. More…\n\nSabio is a wonderfully flexible face that can sit happily alongside artwork that owes its inspiration to any era from the Art Deco onwards. The regular form is gently and subtly oblique, and the glyphs have a slight hint of swash about them. Alternate and perpendicular forms are also offered. The regular, alternate and perpendicular forms are all in turn offered in regular, and bold weights as well as in a condensed form.\n\nMore samples of Sabio in action can be found on Greater Albion's [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014125624/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\n",
