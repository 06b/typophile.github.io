      "content": "If I remember correctly, Type 3 allowed practically any PostScript function to be used, including strokes, grayscale, conditional statements—anything pretty much. This is how random fonts like Beowolf were possible. It was also used for clip art fonts with complex images. The downside: no hints, so if all you wanted to do was to make a normal font, it looked like crap on a 300 dpi laser printer.\n\nI do recall a company selling Type 3 fonts based on strokes. The advantage they touted was that you could squeeze or stretch the fonts without the kind of distortions you would get with outline fonts. Unfortunately, since the fonts were composed of unvarying strokes, the designs were limited and lacked optical corrections.\n\nI also seem to recall that the original version of Courier that was built into the original LaserWriter was stroke-based.\n\n"

      "content": "If I can add a small comment.\n\nType 1 fonts permit stroke-based outlines. Most of  \nthe type 1 fonts have a PaintType defined to be 0,  \nbut if you set it to be 1, and define StrokeWidth to be  \nthe pen thickness (30 is thin, 100 is thick), then  \noutlines are stroked. This can be used to thicken  \nfonts (not recommended though!), but it can also be used  \nto render fonts as strokes only.\n\nThe change in the PaintType value and the addition of StrokeWidth  \nparameter can be done in a standard text editor on the “pfa” version  \nof a type 1 font.\n\nIf this sounds too technical, I apologize. I will try  \nbetter next time.\n\nLuc\n\n"

He told me he had to outline the strokes of the font, which was simply a unclosed path when looked at in Illustrator outline view.  \nNow instead of thinkng he’s crazy (or being jealous of his enhanced perception), I feel sorry for him that he had to deal with it.
