  "content": "Hey gang,\n\nYears ago surfing the web I found a pretty well-put together PDF series on graphic design that was well-designed and also colorful and had many examples in it, approaching design basics and explaining design for non-designers. I've since lost it and have no recollection of the title... It explained typography as well, including leading, kerning, tracking...\n\nDoes anyone have a similar guide (of the basics of design, not just type) that I could easily get a hold of?\n\nThanks!\n\n",
