It is not a big ''BANG''. It is more a thunder with  \nlittle noise that create a lot of light in the sky.\n\n"

Not sure that you  \nneed the angled stress on the O.\n\n• Cirque colors light compared to Eloize, not sure if that's your intention. Cirque feels like it's too small.\n\n• kerning needs some work. Compare the E-L combo, for example, to the O-I.\n\n• the Z-E seems like it would work better if the Z was longer and extended further right, which would also help narrow the large gap.\n\n• The tail on the Q ... maybe it should mimic the Z?\n\nbest of luck eric.\n\n"

      "content": "The Z does not conform to the feel of the other characters. It has a sweeping swash tail as opposed to a straight line terminating in a curve.  \nIf you're going to take the Z away from the style of the other letterforms, you could explore playing with the Z so it is perhaps more illustrative - suggestive of a bolt of lightning or something similar (which will tie in with your Eloize theme). It needs some thought and sensitivity though.\n\nBJ harvey makes a good observation with the C, Q and O not being the same. Id choose one or the other and stick to it.\n\n/Dimi\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::  \nWicked Design Potions\n\n"
