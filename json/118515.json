It should appear on Dan X Solo 1979 collection \"Sans Serif Display Alphabets\" (p. 96).  \nI know there's a freebie floating around but can't say about its legitimacy. Note it also carries the other /S (not the one of your sample).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051525im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tasminbold_5551.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "There is also Tasmin by David Crosby. I don't know who copied whom.  \nPrevious discussion [http://typophile.com/node/107791](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051525/http:/typophile.com/node/107791 \"http://typophile.com/node/107791\")\n\nI have no info on the origin of the pre-digital font, other than that Dan X. Solo gave the name of Tasmin to this design, which he may have purchased as metal type.\n\nThis Art Nouveau design is a variation on Quaint by the Dickinson Type Foundry of Boston. Aka Desdemona by Karl Brendler & Söhne of Vienna.  \nDesdemona [http://luc.devroye.org/KarlBrendler+Soehne-Desdemona.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317051525/http:/luc.devroye.org/KarlBrendler+Soehne-Desdemona.jpg \"http://luc.devroye.org/KarlBrendler+Soehne-Desdemona.jpg\") Both are circa 1900. I don't know which came first. Several good digital versions.  \nDon\n\n"
