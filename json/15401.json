I am not that interested in the logos, or the posters, but in the 'peripheral' material, such as press releases, signage, tickets, etc. During my search I have come accross the comment that a custom font was designed for signage for the Mexico 68 games. Unfortunately, I cannot find any visuals. The only other game in which type has any mention is Athens 2004, where they used Gill Sans and had a Greek cut for it.\n\nGreatful for any pointers to the above.\n\nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag Ltd\n\n",

      "content": " **An interesting Olympic Tale** (somewhat brief but very true)\n\nI was having a casual conversation with a few Compugraphic/Agfa country managers during DRUPA 88 in Düsseldorf, when Sr. Benet, the Cg manager for Spain mentioned that Barcelona was to host the 1992 Olympics. He had heard that the design committee was interested in using ITC Barcelona for obvious reasons, and I said, \"like hell.\"\n\nAt that point, with the blessing of Agfa's senior management, I started an effort to have a custom type family created for exclusive use by COOB92 (Organizing Committee for Barcelona Olympics 92) for all branding, official communications, press releases, signage/wayfinding systems, etc.\n\nAfter a series of meetings and proposals, COOB92 (the hosting country's Olympic Committee bears these responsibilities) agreed that Agfa-Compugraphic (as it was officially named then) could develop and have exclusive distribution rights for an official and unique typeface for the Barcelona 92 Olympics. In return, Agfa-Cg would pay a fee of $1.3 million to COOB92 to become an official sponsor. The main proviso (there were more small print and minor provisions to the agreement) was that the NAME and BRAND of AGFA could not be used or displayed because that would violate provisions of one of their biggest sponsors -- Kodak.\n\nI was able to justify the $1.3 million sponsorship fee to my management since the global PR and subsequent sales of fonts and typesetting equipment (high-end machines were still proprietary) would offset the expense. (Business, business, money, money.)\n\nI was then able to officially meet with the designated Olympic design team, Quod Diseño y Marketing, S.A., and began working with Josep Maria Trias and Geordi Mantegna on their requirements for a custom type design. Since originally ITC Barcelona was one of several designs being considered for the wordmark, they were open to my suggestion to view new design sketches by Ed Benguiat.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101112003248im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Catalan_2.png)\n_Very early sketches of medium with italics_\n\nAfter many months and several trips to Barcelona, Ed Benguiat and I finally presented a design that Trias felt could work. Several months later, an official press meeting was held in Paris to announce that _Catalana_ would become the official type family for the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympic Games. (The official announcement of the Rotis type family by Otl Aicher was also announced to the international press.)\n\nShortly after all the PR, Agfa announced that Compugraphic, now wholly owned by Agfa, would now be named simply AGFA.\n\nThis violated the proviso of the Olympic sponsorship since Kodak was to be the ONLY film company sponsor, and their sponsorship fee was a whole heck larger than the $1.3 million we were coughing up. Also, it was a perfect excuse for Agfa to withdraw from the committed fee, since by then, proprietary sale of equipment and fonts were dwindling and the sale of a single type family in PostScript fonts was not enough to offset the expense.\n\nJosep Maria Trias, who was not completely enamored with the _Catalana_ design, opted to use Times New Roman for all branding instead, since he felt it was _a timeless classic and widely accepted_ (yikes!).\n\n**_Adios Catalana_**\n\n"
