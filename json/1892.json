If anyone has any pertinant information (when, where, size of collections, distribution, etc...) please help.   \nI am intentionally avoiding using the term \"printing press\" as there is some dispute here as to when and where it was invented.\n\n [‹ How do you make your weights?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911194802/http:/typophile.com/node/2058 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [{ Designers wanted for new foundry } ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911194802/http:/typophile.com/node/2062 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I'm on my way out right now, but I can type them & send them to you tomorrow if they'd be helpful. If you have access to the book, I believe chapter 2 deals with Asia. IIRC, Pi Sheng was a Chinese chemist and invented movable type during the middle of the 11th century.\n\n"

This is still in print and available from them.   \n   \nIt was essentially put together to counter Western claims and does a very good job of it. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean methods of casting letterforms are thoroughly examined. Photographs reveal the casting molds, cast characters, etc.   \n   \nMany earlier cultures cast coins and medallions and the similar in like molds. As did the Europeans. It just never occurred to the latter to make the leap. But when they did they had several great advantages over those that gone before: very advanced and progressive \"mechanics\" (the idea, not the job description!!!), manufactured interchangable parts and tools (and the marketing for it), an intense knowledge of metallurgy (thanks to the alchemists), and, of course, a very easily reproducable letterform (that of the textura) and a written language that had been compressed into a very small number of characters.   \n   \nStamping and casting techniques go back as far as the beginnings of written languages (repeatable stamping can be found in cave paintings), but the roads traveled were clearly separated and seem not to have crossed. The techniques of writing and those that would have allowed the exact reproduction of letterform (with some exception, such as the Phaistos stone) were ideas not put together until relatively late in the historical model.   \n   \nGerald\n\n"

His view, I believe, was that Guttenberg didn't invent any of the parts of his system, but the invention was the _system_ itself that he assembled and structured out of existing technology.   \n   \nThe innovation - which then spread like wildfire - was the system, not any piece of it. And this system also did not exist in the far east, though many parts of it did.\n\n"

They had seen Asian currency. The word used was \"perfected,\" to mean \"improved on.\" Invention is a later historical term.   \n   \nNor did Columbus' claim to have found a land that was not previously known (terra incognito) to Europeans mean that he somehow invented it and its peoples into existence.   \n   \nHe and many other Europeans knew something was there. Based on previous ocean expeditions it was clear to earlier navigators that a land mass must have existed right where Columbus found it. There were \"speculative\" maps of such available to Columbus. He, in fact, used them, deceivingly, to deliberately reduce his supply request to get approval for financing. He knew approximately how far to go, and supplied only as much as needed to get there.   \n   \nHe wasn't trying to prove the Earth was round or even trying to find the Asian landfall. Or to claim or invade new lands for his benefactors. I have read his \"letter\" on the discovery (the first \"news\" ever put to print on European presses) and his diaries. This man was hardly a conquistidor. He did not share the subsequent European political agenda in regard to the \"discovery.\"   \n   \nGerald\n\n"

      "content": "William   \n   \nYes, I believe that would be correct. But just as popular history distorts the reality of \"the invention of printing,\" so to it may have distorted the identity of the \"inventor\" as well.   \n   \nWe only really know, from any documented evidence, that Gutenberg was involved in various projects (that somehow involved the idea of printing) for some twenty years before the publication of the Bible. It is assumed from these that he did come up with the adjustable type casting mold. And it can be assumed, from the legal documentation regarding the contracting of the Bible, that he had something to do with outfitting the presses and assembling the preliminary materials necessary for the printing of it. Nothing much more than that.   \n   \nLikely there were several people working on the similar idea of producing a form of mechanical writing. There are unidentifiable artifacts (experiments?) in existence. In regard to the Bible itself, the significant contributions of Fust and, particularly, Schoeffer (a trained copyist) seem to have been driven down by popular history. Yet the book is so perfect in its production that it seems a bit odd that a mechanical wizard would be attributed to its printing when the ability to design a highly sophisticated typeface, and develop the composition for a book would likely have been beyond his skill and knowledge. Renaissance man or no, there is just so much one can master. The previous and later printing that can be conceivably \"attributed\" to Gutenberg, bear none of the hallmarks of the Bible printing (with the exception of the unique ink formulation).   \n   \nGerald\n\n"

Of course, type moulds of some kind must have existed in Asia, but I've never seen one or a picture of one. Indeed, pictures of European moulds are very few in number, and only a handful of later renaissance examples survive. So rare is their depiction in illustrations of the type making process that it is assumed that, like the equally rare counterpunches, the moulds were a trade secret.   \n   \nI've seen the _Diamond Sutra_ several times, and it is very beautiful, but certainly not as well printed as Gutenberg's 42-line Bible. The use of the term 'perfected' in describing Gutenberg's contribution is apt.   \n   \nIn terms of inventing a 'system', the contribution of Fust & Schoeffer is often overlooked: they invented the system we call publishing, _i.e._ the production and marketing of books.\n\n"

The making and selling of books was fairly well established, and had been for some time, otherwise there would have been no \"potential\" to that little ad hoc project.

He also made smaller sized books for a speculative market, printed in languages other than Latin, introduced a slew of informational design elements (most of which are standard in books today), begin printing classical Greek works, scientific materials, etc. He is actually considered the first of the scholar-printers.   \n   \nMuch of the earlier incunabula was commissioned or directed at an existant and clearly defined market. Don't know that this makes much of a definitional distinction. But I recall that the 42-line Bible itself might have been a commission of the Church; as it seems to have been financed by it and most copies were dispersed to various elements of the Church upon completion of the project. I know there were copies available for sale to the established book market though as Fust apparently died of the Black Plague on a selling trip.   \n   \nI guess this could or could not lend some credance to the idea of it being a publishing venture of sorts.

You are correct about the importance of the pocket editions, printing in the vernacular and Greek, etc.   \n   \nI don't know what the date of the first Frankfurt bookfair was, but I remember being struck in a book I was reading by the fact that within Gutenberg's own lifetime this recognisable publishing industry was in place. Most likely it was, as you suggest, built on top of a pre-existing market for manuscript books, and perhaps the Frankfurst fair existed in some form _before_ the early printer-publishers began travelling across Europe both selling their books and buying manuscripts for new ones. I didn't claim that Fust & Schoeffer were the first publishers: I said that they appear to have been instrumental in creating a system for producing and distributing books that is recognisable in publishing to this day.\n\n"
