      "content": "Thanks for the prompt response, Stephen. I've checked Stereo and Zapata and they are not quite there yet. And unless it's retouched it's not Antique Central either. Bob Dahlquist's version (great link, btw) looks very similar but do you know if it is commercially available?   \n   \nThanks a lot for your help, I've been after this face ever since I first saw it in the \"stereo\" logo on an old album cover.   \n   \nJesus\n\n"
