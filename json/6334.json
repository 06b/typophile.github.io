      "content": "Dude, I am definitely the person to ask.   \n   \nI graduated from RISD in the United States (BFA Graphic Design 2001), and am now studying typography in Germany.   \n   \nFirst of all, be prepared for a lot of beaurocracy, which will often be contradictory.   \n   \nIf you already have a bachelor's degree, you may be able to transfer halfway into a German Diplom program. German Diploms are technically equivalent to Masters' Degrees, even though the British have recently challenged this. Almost all German college students graduate with this one degree, which normally takes anywhere from 4 to six years to complete. The German government is trying to phase in BAs and MAs, but it hasn't hit the serious art schools yet.   \n   \nIn order to study graphic design as anything other than an exchange student for a semester or two, you must speak German. You must pass exams. Some states require you to have already passed the exams before you can even apply, like Baden-Würrtemberg.   \n   \nSome states will charge you a 500 Euro per semester tuition fee, because you already have a foreign degree, like Nordrhein-Westfalen. German higher education is still generaly free, but I would be willing to bet that this would change while you would be enrolled. Be prepared to have to spend more money than expected to finish your degree if you start one.   \n   \nThere are two types of university in Germany, Universit\n\n"

Calligraphy has not been taught at the HfG since the late 1980s, at least. Type design hasn't been really taught there either since the early 1990s (and won't ever be again, so I hear), evern though a lot of students engage in a bit of it\n\n"

Do you study there?   \n   \nFor a few months now, a few students from the HfG and I have been organizing regular Typo-Stammtisch evenings in FFM/Sachsenhausen. Our next one is one is on Tuesday the 31st, and if you are even the least bit interested in type design, your should come. (This invitation goes for anyone else who might be in the Rhein-Main area, and reading this!)   \n   \nMehr Info zum Typostammtish: [http://www.typeoff.de/typostammtisch](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019084428/http:/www.typeoff.de/typostammtisch)\n\n"

      "content": "Dan, thanks for all the info. I was aware that K. G. Hoefer died some years ago. It's a pity, that type design education has become less important in Offenbach since his retirement (there are not so many cultural highlights in this city anyway in my opinion, and the Schriftklasse was said to have a high reputation).   \n   \nI am not a design professional -- I studied in Darmstadt, but nothing related to art. Nevertheless I am interested in the Stammtisch (thanks for the invitation), but unfortunately I am on a move away from Darmstadt next week, since I finished my studies. So probably I won't have the time to visit Sachsenhausen.   \n   \nMarkus\n\n"
