  "content": "Does anybody know what font they use for the credits at the bottom of movie posters? I tried Helvetica condensed and it's close... but there seems to be a particular font that is used on the majority of movie posters.   \n   \nFor example, check out the movie poster for \"The Usual Suspects.\" The credits at the bottom are kinda small, but I think you will know what I\"m talking about (thin sans-serif font). Thanks! ![Sample Movie Poster](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027181800im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13075.jpg)\n\n",
