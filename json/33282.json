Star = A, get it? And Helveticaaaa... Always tough adapting second-hand goods (it made more sense when they were the Minnesota North Stars). I guess the name Oilers was already taken. However, the total-jersey interpretation is quite cool.  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111030811im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/stars_4039.jpg)\n\n [‹ creative CV ideas](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111030811/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29377 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Thanks to CS3, I can now KNOW one icon from the next!
