I really like windsong ( [http://www.dafont.com/windsong.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231247/http:/www.dafont.com/windsong.font \"http://www.dafont.com/windsong.font\")), but the loopy lowercase d drives me insane, especially since \"wedding\" requires it to be doubled up, which just looks tacky and wrong.
