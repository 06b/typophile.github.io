  "content": "Hi,\n\nSome time around 1990 I purchased a Linotype L100 PostScript capstan imagesetter to typeset galleys for pasteup. As far as I know, this was the first high-resolution PostScript device (up to 1270dpi).\n\nUnfortunately I don't have space for it, and it will be have to be scrapped if I cannot find a better home for it. It was working when decommissioned and is basically complete but has sustained some minor damage to main circuit board during transit.\n\nContact me here...\n\n--Toby\n\n",
