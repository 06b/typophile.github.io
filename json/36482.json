I created a kern feature in FontLab, but upon export the kerning wouldn’t show up in either OSX Cocoa apps or the Adobe apps. When I reimported the exported fonts in FontLab, the kern feature was still there. The solution? For some reason the system wouldn’t show the kern feature unless I added another feature, in this case a simple ligature feature. Go figure.\n\n [‹ Flowing text across Indesign pages](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202195107/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36508 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Positive Kerning ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202195107/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36457 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
