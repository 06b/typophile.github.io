      "content": "i think this logo is pretty funny. i always have trouble liking logos where a picture is incorporated into the letters, because you have to try to see a picture and a letter, and you can't see them at the same time.   \n   \nthe first E has a weird ending, and could be better... i would suggest having the line drawing separate from the type. also, why isn't the other E attached?   \n   \nare the words \"Plastic Surgery\" going to be incorporated?\n\n"

      "content": "looks a little op art to me. like something you'd see in the New Yorker a decade ago.   \n   \nHowever, the idea of the letters 'drawing' the face is a good idea. I just think here your E is getting wonky, try looking at the E without the face, as just a letter.   \n   \nperhaps the face is more idiographic/abstract. the face profile could be circular and tie in better with the E. your letters could be a geometric sans serif. something contemporary and sleek. I think this would be more fitting for a plastic surgery clinic named Elite.   \n   \nalso, for another concept the E could be an eye.\n\n"

      "content": "The face seems as if it is being forced into the shape of the \"e\". At first glance, I just kept staring at the face wondering what was going on there instead of reading \"elite\". That might bring up some issues because if the name gets lost when people look at this, it will defeat the purpose of conveying the brand.   \n   \nThe face looks like a football player from the 1920s, where a facemask wasn't a part of the helmet. Also, I thought of Amelia Eahart with the old pilot style cap which is confusing.   \n   \nI see what you're trying to do here by making the swash of the \"l\" cross the eye of the graphic. But it almost looks painful, almost poking into the eye which is probably not what the surgeon wants to convey.   \n   \nAlso, the face seems as if it is worried or concerned, as opposed to being happy and excited about surgery which might convey the wrong message.   \n   \nTry to do some more research into the plastic surgery market in general, and ask the client some more specific questions to come up with more solutions.\n\n"

      "content": "Unless the Plastic Surgery is about correcting an accident or birth defect, then its about self esteem. The illustration could use refinement but its a great start. What era was more self assorbed then pre-depression America. The Illustration alludes to what you might want to achieve, captured youth, beauty? I'm not ready to say this isn't a way to go. Why look like every other Plastic Surgent. Dam the research\n\n"

Now, against any of Daniel's endearing support for Deco surgery, I must say that I'll re-open this logo when we get a fashion cosmetic client. Well, it was fun to work on while the moment lasted. Your comments are much appreciated!\n\n"
