According to Hermann Zapf where and when? In Linotype’s brochure for Optima nova, there is a photo of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial lettering, because it is done in Optima. For the same reason, in at least one of Hermann Zapf’s books, a picture of a rubbing from the wall appears as well.\n\nYou should know who John Benson is… aside from being a type designer in his own right, he ran the John Stevens Shop in Newport, RI for decades, and undertook a number of prominent lettering commissions in Washington, DC (and elsewhere). His son Nick runs the business now as far as I know. I’m sure that David Berlow could fill in more details.\n\nThe story that I had been told was that Maya Lin spoke with him about the lettering. It would have been too labor intensive to letter all of those names by hand, so a typeface was used instead. Apparently, Benson suggested Optima to her, and it was used.\n\n"

Anyone who thinks otherwise has not seen it. I am as fond as anyone of the visual pun but this is just insulting and in very bad taste. I hated the war then, I hate the war now, I hated being there and seeing a country being strangled by bloodshed there while another country, mine, was being strangled by lies and losses of its own. Whatever you think of that time in our history, the people who died there needlessly deserve better than this mockery.  \nImagine if Bloomingdales’s or Macy’s in New York would place posters in the New York subways depicting people jumping out of windows of the WTC holding signs with the names of the various department store locations? This isn’t just a coincidental use of Optima, it is done on purpose. I can’t imagine the conversation at the presentation of those ads to the client.
