Well, I've been obsessed with measuring press gain in newspapers for a while now. This is partly because Nour (Patria's Armenian counterpart) is supposed to end up as the body face for a daily newspaper. Another reason is my fascination with trapping - something not usually needed but potentially very beneficial in a newspaper, \\*especially\\* for tiny type like in stock listing...   \n   \nSo what I would love to be able to do with TFJ's new font is to superimpose a small snippet of hi-fi outline data over a hi-res scan of actual output. A big favor to ask, maybe, but something I will do once I have the scan for you guys.   \n   \nIn the meantime, you can check out the following images:   \n   \nA scan from my \"target\" newspaper, next to a rendering, with measurements:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125425/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif)   \nPoint size: 8   \n   \nThis one is not my own comparison; it's from an article by Gurtler & Mengelt in Visible Language:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/latnewsp.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125425/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/latnewsp.gif)   \nPoint size: they don't say.   \n   \nNow, the Armenian sample clearly exhibits much more gain than any western newspaper would find itself stuck with, and even the second image is probably too drastic these days, but as long there's \\*some\\* gain, I'd like to measure it.   \n   \nBTW, in case you'd like to see how bad it can get, here's a staggering overlay of Mandel's masterful Colorado font (used for phone books):   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125425/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif)   \nPoint size: ~4   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

On the other hand, I even like the name!   \n   \nBTW, am I correct in noting that the paper quality is a bit lower now than before, or is that just within expected variance? If it is lower, then that makes Retina even more impressive. Another coolness is the trapping. Look at the bold \"N\" in the zoom view - it's clearly superior to the old Helvetica results. And the characters with small bowls (like the \"R\" - not shown there) have that distinct Bell Centennial thing going on.   \n   \nAnyway, if nobody at THF minds, I'd still like to scan and post a couple of more views of Retina: one showing a short paragraph, the other at very hi res.

The thing is, 600 is beyond the absolute resolution-fidelity of the reproduction anyway. \\*However\\*, gain can still be measured.   \n   \nThe first is at 1200dpi, and it shows the good effects of the killer trapping, in some key letters. It also shows how the lc \"g\" has been reduced in the x-height to make more room for its descender.   \n(~250K) [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina\\_1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125425/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_1.gif)   \nNote: I've applied some gentle Levels, Unsharp Masking, and Posterize.   \n   \nThe second is at 2400dpi, and this is the one I would like very much to be able to superimpose the outlines.

WSJ is till using Helvetica for most of their tiny text blocks - but maybe this was a test to see if Retina could replace it wholesale.   \n(~200K) [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina\\_3.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125425/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_3.gif)   \nNote: Tweaked as #1 above.   \n   \n----   \n   \nWhat's really interesting about Retina is this:   \nIf you consider that optimization for small sizes and press gain goes hand-in-hand with a certain \"funkiness\" in letterforms (like severe trapping, and exagerated counters - look at the lc \"e\"), it looks to me like Retina actually has a lot more room \"down below\". In effect, among the three lower limits (reproduction fidelity, font features and reader acuity), Retina removes the font issue: it could be used even much smaller than in the WSJ, were it not for limit #1, but especially #3.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It's much much better than mine (no surprise).   \n   \nI've taken the liberty to do two things with it:   \n   \n   \n1. Crop out this string:   \n   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina\\_4.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125425/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_4.gif)   \n   \nIf TFJ is indeed \"listening\", I'd like to revise/downgrade my request for outlines to just those three letters (at that weight, of course). If it doesn't happen, no biggie - if it happens, super nice of him.   \n   \nBTW, it's interesting to note that some of the trapping is still visible - a sure indication that Retina has more room \"below\".   \n   \n   \n2. Splice together a comparison of pre and post numerals:   \n   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina\\_5.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125425/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/retina_5.gif)   \n   \nI'll note again that the quality of the paper/reproduction seems lower in the Retina sample: look at the decimal points (which I'm presuming are rigid rectangles in the outlines).   \n   \nBut the point of this comparison is the \\*structures\\* of the numerals, and Retina's are so superior to Helvetica's (while remaining stylistically homogenous), it's not even funny.   \n   \n----   \n   \nThinking some more about what I previously wrote concerning the three \"lower limits\" of legibility (with respect to size), I realized that the untapped potential of Retina (I mean untapped by WSJ) isn't really in terms of size (especially considering that the average WSJ reader is more likely to have faltering vision, being more \"senior\"), but more in terms of fidelity (or actually, lack of it): TFJ has made a font which can work well in much poorer reproduction conditions than we're seeing here. Now, a trapping axis would be \\*so\\* nice, but at least its [apparent] absence gives us something to look forward to!   \n   \n\\> Tobias likened these strangenesses to particle theory   \n   \nNot to be too literal, but let's not forget that we're physical beings in a physical world!   \n   \nI in turn might draw a parallel between the states of matter (solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma) and the states of reading (here with respect to size). I once sketched this rough graph:   \n   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/optic\\_01.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125425/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/optic_01.gif)   \n   \nIt tries to show a correspondence between size and optical compensation (here I mean things like more open counters). Above a certain point size (nominally 24 here) there is no need for compensation at all. Below a certain point size (like 5), the extenders [have to] become so short that you'd break down and use all-caps - at that size immersive reading is virtually impossible anyway. And the segment of least slope (here between 8 and 12) is the most delicate part, where boumas (word shapes) have to be just right. I could elaborate more, but you might be bored senseless already, and it's getting late over here...   \n   \nSo let me try to wrap this up:   \nThe reason for the non-linearity of the graph is due to the \"fighting-sisters\" nature of Legibility versus Readability: they come into play differently depending on type size (among other things, of course), and together they give up three states of reading:   \n1. Below comfortable immersive reading: here legibility is king (queen?), and x-heights have to swell, for example.   \n2. Immersive reading: readability is more important than legibility - and for example ITC-style x-heights ruin everything.   \n3. Above comfortable reading: legibility is a non-issue (although what might be called \"decipherability\" is key), and readability is moot. What counts most here? What I call \"drama\" (avoiding the potentially misleading \"beauty\").   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The issues of ink spread pale into insignificance.   \n   \n   \nJoe\n\n"

Of course, at this size you're really depending upon reliable printing. Sheet-fed offset on coated stock is a little more hospitable than the maelstrom of the WSJ print facility.   \n   \nHere are some additional high resolution scans of Retina and its predecessor. These are true 1,200 dpi scans, unadjusted. (They're also about 2mb each, so download them at your own peril.)   \n   \nwww.typography.com/press/wsj\\_after\\_retina.gif   \nwww.typography.com/press/wsj\\_before\\_retina.gif   \n   \nAt some point I'd like to rescan these in color, but these should do for now.   \n   \nDespite Mr. Stalin's nanofont goofiness above, I do think that these kinds of atomic metaphors are useful for agate type. Like Bell Centennial, Retina has a lot of burlesque moves that are incomprehensible in large sizes but essential in small ones. In explaining this to Joe and David at the Journal, Tobias likened these strangenesses to particle theory, noting that when you reduce things down to an atomic scale, the laws of physics break down. I thought it a good comparison.\n\n"
