Finding squarish narrow serif fonts with a serif on the middle arm of the E was not too easy, but maybe [Pall Mall](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103062710/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/pall-mall-rr/) Bold would work. You could use some sort of blurring effect and/or added stroke to further simulate the sample.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
