  "content": "Hello typophiles,  \nI'm working on a project that calls for a monospace typeface - but here's the catch - it needs to be condensed and somewhat elegant as well...  \nI did the original design with Letter Gothic but I'm looking for something else, with possibly more weight.\n\nDo you know of a great condensed monospace typeface that I may have overlooked?\n\nI'd love to know about it!\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nViviane\n\n",

      "content": "I have seen tricks done with the middle stroke of an M and W to make narrow even narrower.\n\nI think one of the failures of Adobe's Muliple Master technology was related to the M and W.\n\nIf we inspect Merganthaler/Linotype's metal type designs of days gone by, we will find the designs of M and W very much differed dependinfg upon the point size of the design. At wider at smaller point sizes, and narrower at larger point sizers.\n\nThis is because to promote readability, a wider M or W is required at smaller point sizes, but at larger point sizes the increased white space is unnecessary and too dominant.\n\nSimilarly, good monotype designs to appear at smaller point sizes should be wider, than designs to appear at larger point sizes, which should be narrower.\n\nOn a related topic, I heard from a professional type designer who did very interesting creative work for Microsoft's Typography Group. The designer explained that at very small points sizes, widths could be manipulated for on-screen only (@ lower resolution) representation, where certain characters could appearer wider than during printing at a much higher resolution.\n\n"
