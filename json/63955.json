  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m about to start writing my diploma thesis in media computer science.  \nThe idea that occurred to me first was trying to improve an aspect in the process of type design, as I really like the combination of design and technology.\n\nSo I had a look at FontForge and FontLab with regard to the ease of use for designers. OpenType feature creation in those tools seems to me not to be made for people with a less technical background. Even OTMaster and VOLT which claim to do or sound like doing so didn’t meet my expectations in this respect.\n\nThat’s why I think about developing a more designer-focused tool…\n\nMy first humble ideas are:\n\n- A tool to visually edit OpenType features with emphasis on a user-friendly interface (without unexplained cryptic abbreviations)\n- Integration of the specification in a way that it doesn’t clutter the user interface but is always within reach\n- I’d like to both offer visual tools as well as allowing for directly editing the code\n- That would have to include live-updating and checking feature code on the fly…\n- But on the other hand it could avoid/indicate errors before font is compiled\n\nProbably, I will be focusing on AFDKO-syntax. So far I don’t have a decent knowledge of AFDKO, but I already read quite a bit about OpenType and AFDKO and I’m following the threads in this forum about OpenType development for a while (I especially enjoyed reading [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106070438/http:/typophile.com/node/55208)). Also, I did my own first tests with OpenType feature generation using AFDKO.\n\nNow I’d really like to know what you think of my _vague_ idea. Is it reasonable? Probably I missed some important aspects. Ideas and criticism are very much appreciated. Eventually, I might as well need some test persons in order to evaluate my prototype.\n\nThanks for reading and for your comments!  \nBut dont’t forget: it’s only a diploma thesis…\n\nMiZ\n\n",

Several good tools have already been made using his code, and not just by him.\n\nCheck it out:\n\n[http://tools.typesupply.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106070438/http:/tools.typesupply.com/ \"http://tools.typesupply.com/\")\n\n"

      "content": "What I would find useful is a standalone program that can automatically set up OT classes and code based on what glyphs exist in the font using Adobe’s suggested glyph naming. A good app for building combining diacriticals would be a big help as we don’t have one on the Mac platform AFAIK. You should also get in touch with people who build fonts with lots of complex replacements—Patrick Griffin at Canada Type, Ale Paul at SudTipos, and House Industries—to see if they have needs that current software is not meeting.\n\nI second Mark’s suggestion that you look up Tal’s code. You should also contact Tal and Erik van Blokand to see if there’s pent-up demand for something that nobody has got around to yet.\n\n"

Before bothering people directly I wanted to see if there is some interest in an application like this at all. Probably I will add underware to the list.\n\n"
