      "content": "Not to just bump this spamvertised thread, here is a nice little story about Pedro Guitton, 'Index Book' and their 'ethics' of borrowing elements from existing logos they published in previous books.\n\nIll try to make this as short as possible, but this may be quite interesting, for some.\n\nIn 2002 / 2003 I designed a logo for a local restaurant, named 'benito'.  \n_( [http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/4571/benito1ki.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014002750/http:/img467.imageshack.us/img467/4571/benito1ki.gif \"http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/4571/benito1ki.gif\") )_\n\nIn 2004 I have been asked by Andres Fredes / Juland, if I would be interested in getting some of my works published in an upcoming book project, 'Around Europe Logos', released by 'Index Book', Barcelona. I was quite honored, back then, getting invited for this, so I submitted a few of my works, including the 'benito' logo. The book gets published, the 'benito' mark is in. Fine.\n\nEarlier this week I get another invitation to submit works for an upcoming 'Index Book' release. This time coordinated by Pedro Guitton. I then take a look at his site and portfolio, and notice the following logo, he 'designed' for 'Burro Catalan', in 2005, according to his site.  \n_( [http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/767/burrocatalan6yr.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014002750/http:/img467.imageshack.us/img467/767/burrocatalan6yr.gif \"http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/767/burrocatalan6yr.gif\") )  \n( Source of the 'Burro Catalan' sample image: [http://www.pedroguitton.com/mito\\_3\\_portfolio\\_46.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014002750/http:/www.pedroguitton.com/mito_3_portfolio_46.htm \"http://www.pedroguitton.com/mito\\_3\\_portfolio\\_46.htm\") )_\n\nI have yet to find out what exactly is the relation between the author of the book I actually submitted logos to, back then, Andres Fredes; The publisher 'Index Book' who then had high resolution, printable versions of the logos; And Pedro Guitton who evidently, shamelessly 'borrowed' elements from my 'benito' logo.\n\nOf course I contacted Pedro Guitton, and the publisher 'Index Book' as well, to ask them about this. This is what Mr. Guitton responded:  \n_'for my part it´s a complete coincidence...'  \n'believed or not i have my mind clear and i´m a really creative person  \nhave a good one !'_\n\n( I have yet to get any response from the publisher itself. )\n\nDav\n\n"
