The only letters you would need to modify are the U, N and R — all relatively simple forms that you could make from other letters in the font. In fact, the R looks like it might have been made from the K or k; and the U & N could be made by deleting one line of the O.\n\nIf that approach doesn’t appeal to you, I’d start searching the Dafont.com ’Techno’ category for a freebie, if no one else ID’s this.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
