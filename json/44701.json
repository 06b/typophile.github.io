The paths that Illustrator is generating when I start blowing strokes up and converting them to outlines are horrible; I think I need to redo some stuff in Fontlab and start over. If I’m going to keep doing projects with lettering and type manipulation I’ll need to buy a copy of Freehand.\n\n"

      "content": "James, I am guessing that when you bold this as a result of the ’strokes’ you have to make it wider, ie, redraw it, in order to restore the balance of the original. Thus, for example, when the two ’V’s are farther apart, the middle peak will be less heavy. This is part of the “joy” of doing different weights of an M or W, with all those diagonal strokes squished in a small span.\n\n"

When I do outlined/dimensional letters, what I usually do is (illustrator):  \n1-outline my text  \n2-copy and paste the text in back of the original and stroke it to the desired width.  \n3-with the stroked letterforms, I release the complex paths, and delete the forms I don’t need.\n\nThis leaves you with the inside forms (or top layer) as the original type outlines, with a thicker stroke on the outside (or bottom layer). Here’s a quick (poor) example:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706172519im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_4865.gif)\n\n"
