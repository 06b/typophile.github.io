  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI had to upgrade (re-purchase) my version of Meta because I was building  \na template for a client and I wanted us both to be working with the same  \nversion of Meta. I’m on a Mac, they’re on PC.\n\nAnyway, I bought the regular Mac postcript version and told them to do  \nthe same. But they bought Open Type. When I got to their office and opened  \nthe file, the naming conventions for the the 2 versions of Meta were going to  \nall have to be changed in my style sheets.\n\nSo \\_I\\_ upgraded to Open Type and redid all my style sheets. Then sent them  \nthe new file and still the same problem.\n\nNow they say they may not have purchased Open Type. But that would mean  \none of the templates had to have worked.\n\nBy the way, I had them do a screenshot and oddly, the OT logo is next to the  \nfont names. But FontFont said that sometimes PCs perceive a font as OT when  \nreally it isn’t.\n\nI’m awaiting feedback from FontFont. In the meantime, does anyone know if  \nthere is usually this font name problem? FontFont insisted that if we bought  \nthe same version, even cross platform, the names used for each style would  \nbe identical.\n\nI just want to know if it’s typical to have to change the style sheets to reflect  \nthe names used on the other system.\n\nThanks,  \nJane\n\n [‹ Akira Kobayashi](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024131059/http:/typophile.com/node/38254 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fraktur Wortmarke ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024131059/http:/typophile.com/node/38195 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
