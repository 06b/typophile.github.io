And that we should forget the whole thing because those greedy motherwhatevers will just do whatever they do to us from behind.\n\nI suggest that we start with a single weight (I've started that already), and start critique with that (it has enough glyphs to start with), and move on from that point:\n\nI think, looking those glyphs, that x-height compared to ascender and weight is not too bad, but I would like the dot to be heavier. I'm Finnish, so for me it is too wide, but others should address that from their perspective.\n\nI think this is a long process, so just keep posting. We should be done in a year or two.
