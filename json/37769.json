I also converted some of my old postscript fonts to Opentype with Fontlab and named them so that I would know they were my conversions, should enhanced OT versions become available in the future from the vendor. I also have an aesthetic disagreement with vendors putting a trademark symbol in the font name.\n\nBut Fontlab/Fontographer are certainly overkill for that task alone — I’m curious what suggestions people have, as well.\n\n"

      "content": "Converting a font also voids and support or assistance you might receive from a foundry in the event of a problem. As someone who troubleshoots font issues regularly, I would have to say that “converted” fonts often cause a disproportionate amount of problems. Font naming is just one issue. As mentioned in other threads, FontLab’s “green gem” auto-naming icon is not sufficient to ensure fonts will work in all applications or across operating systems. A converted font is just like a piece of software that has not been tested. It might work, but the probability of failure is higher. That’s why, for example, you can have confidence in Adobe’s fonts—the same files I’m using have been tested by hundreds of thousands of users. In the case of small vendors like Mr. Shinn, there may be relatively fewer customers. However the foundry takes personal responsibility for making the product function correctly.\n\nA lot of fonts that people think are “corrupt” or “damaged” didn’t damage themselves...\n\n"

To this end, I wrote a [...] script to convert the names, but... this script apparently does more then just convert the<br>\nnames to uppercase - it seems to corrupt a few glyphs.<br>\n</cite><br>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n\nThe font editor was not FontLab and the bug has been corrected since then but this reminds us that we should always keep a copy of the original font on a stable support (CD Rom, DVD) to make sure we can restore it when needed.\n\nMichel\n\n"
