I've been doing advertisments for them for about 4 months and they don't even know the font used, and I've been using a scanned letter head and because I'm new to type ID, I know I'll just skrew it up if I try to ID it alone...   \n   \nOh! And I have all but 10 fonts ID'd (from my last thread) Thanks for the Estee Lauder reference and link, I raided my moms makeup counter and found some of my fonts!   \n   \nThanks in advance~Mikey\n\n",
