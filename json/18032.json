The words are different sizes and weights, and are spaced differently and have a different offset on the shadow. None of which look intentional.\n\n"

      "content": "If it’s not too late— the main problem is that “Illegal Beats” is all blocky and flat, with a cheap gradient effect, which makes it look like a paper cut-out against a much richer background (and the blocky black extrusion doesn’t help). Secondary problem: the DJ name and the title of the show are too similar in size, so they actually compete due to lack of sufficient contrast.\n\nSince the background is dark, and you want the big title to stand out, perhaps you could actually fill the “Illegal Beats” with something that looks like tubes of neon going around and around, like a “maze” in each letter, in more or less the same yellow-orange color. That would be in keeping with the bright lights and flashiness of the design scheme. Dunno if that would actually be simple to do, but it may help.\n\n"
