Then again, Cheshire Dave's suggestion, Headline One, hmm, it actually looks to be farther from matching... (Also, dates don't match, as that font is from 2002, whereas the sample pic is from 1987... Now, the text on the side, \"Headline One is a replica of real newspaper headline type\", that brings up some interest...) Well, could it be that it was some previous version of Railroad Gothic maybe?...\n\n"
