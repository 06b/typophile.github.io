To change the Autohint preferences, hold the Ctrl key while you click on the Play button.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014050156im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AH_prefs_4876.png)\n\n\\> _Are these corrections the macro has made, or are these corrections I need to make._\n\nThe macro won't make any changes to the outlines, unless you allow it (not recommended). You can think of it as a report of suggestions. For example, seems like you've setup a standard stem with the value 57. When the autohint macro finds outlines where the stems are not exactly that value, it flags a near miss.\n\n"

This is the place where i want my outline to bend a little bit - and that makes it different from the standard stem width. It’s a inner shape of a capital D, that is supposed to be there. The autohinter is giving me the exact position where this occurs – the curve begins at 35 and then eventually goes up to 34.\n\nAnd in this case 34 is a standard stem width.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014050156im_/http:/typophile.com/files/autohint_dee_4065.png)\n\n"
