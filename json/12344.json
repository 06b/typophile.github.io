Google's efficient bots have catalogued the forums and you can search them.\n\nWhen the new search is implemented (it's in testing now) all of the forums, wiki, blogs, news and content will be searchable.\n\nTo search with Google, type _site:Typophile.com your keyword_ into the search field.\n\n",

I would post it here, but the Punchcut Brotherhood™ have eliminated the ability to post any JavaScript snippets to the forums. (Smart move, maliciousware-wise actually.)\n\nThe Favelet can be nabbed from my weblog [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108093207/http:/www.splorp.com/blog/archive/2005_05_01_archive.html#111578113043418502 \"Googophiling.\").\n\nIt currently works in Safari and Firefox and should be fine for users of Internet Explorer as well.\n\n"
