  "content": "Hi there, everyone!\n\nIt's time for a little (self) promotion activity. I would like to introduce the new decorative display font **Pilo** , now available at [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000314). It's based on the logotype of the swedish advertising community [bold.se](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606/http:/www.bold.se/) and I think that the negative kern makes it kind of unique. The Bold logotype is designed by Björn Höglund at [Daddy](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606/http:/www.daddy.se/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pilo_4884.gif)\n\n- - - - -\n\n**About this typeface:**  \nKenneth Pilo had never designed a typeface. This type of project was long overdue. In collaboration with Mårten Fischer, Ray Larabie of Typodermic, and Göran Söderström of Pangea Design, the font “Pilo” was born in 2007. Pilo is a bold, single weight OpenType face featuring subtle inline detailing and a solid sporting aesthetic. It feels both hard and soft, decorative and stoic, vintage and modern.\n\n**About the designer:**  \nKenneth Pilo is currently art director and creative director of [pilo.se](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606/http:/www.pilo.se/), his own virtual agency in Sweden. Since being offered employment at a design agency a week before ending his compulsory schooling, he has worked constantly in the advertising business for over 30 years. During that time, he has done it all ... campaigns, ads, packaging, promotions, commercials, web design, virals, events, television and radio show production, magazines, music ... and the list goes on. All for the love of design. For the past five years he has also been the driving force behind the online community [bold.se](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606/http:/www.bold.se/) - a meeting point for the Swedish advertising business.\n\n- - - - -\n\nI hope you'll like it!\n\nCheers!\n\n/Mårten Fischer\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Pilo\\_Specimen.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606/http:/typophile.com/files/Pilo_Specimen.pdf) | 228.2 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Well, James Puckett and everyone else. Now you can get the inline version of this typeface, [Pilo Thin](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000356) via Veer. Kenneth Pilo puts it like this: »The mission of Pilo Thin was to create a typeface that was exactly the opposite of the very bold [Pilo Regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000314). A thinner cousin, which would create the contrast and to be a credible member of the family. The challenge was to make the font build as much as possible on inner lines in Pilo Regular but that it would feel like it just picked them off. Pilo Thin is more feminine and some shapes has been softened up and adjusted so that Pilo Thin can stand on it’s own, but without forgetting its origin.«\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074606im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pilo_Thin_Specimen_2008-09-02_4733.gif)\n\n"
