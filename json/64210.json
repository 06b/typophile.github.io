  "content": "Hello!\n\nI'm a Graphic Design graduate, now doing freelance. I have a passion for different and interesting typography.\n\n’Poppet’ is a typeface that I created a couple of months ago. I wanted to transform each letter into ’characters’.\n\nEach letter is doing an individual activity, that you would associate with children, i.e. hop-scotch, hula-hoop.\n\nThe letters, at the moment, are black, but I think that adding a bit of colour would bring each personality to life even more!\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [poppet.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416145003/http:/typophile.com/files/poppet_0.jpg) | 332.08 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Looks pretty, but lacks originality. To be negative, it's just a decorated Myriad and nothing more. I think you should design it from scratch; you will learn many things and it can be much like what you wanted.\n\nI see few letters that are related to the activity. If you designed it to be educational, I think it's not working.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks guys!\n\nIt is aimed at children, yes. It's primarily a decorative typeface. I've been creating name plaques, which is sort of like a personalised gift - suitable for a child's christening / birthday. They've gone down quite well. I've been trying to attach images of those, but it won't let me for some reason.\n\nIf I did want to make it purely educational, then yes, I would need to have the activity relate to the corresponding letter. i.e. A-apple, B-ball etc or along those lines.\n\n"
