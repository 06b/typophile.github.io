Goudy Old Style might be a good serif pairing for Copperplate, as Goudy also did it, and Goudy Old Style is fairly wide. Of course this would get an 'old fashioned' look, which may be good or bad, depending on the purpose of your piece.\n\n"

I think you should reconsider it and maybe try some serif typeface instead, but hey that's just my personal point of view ;-)\n\n"
