  "content": "Just now, I was walking to the basement restrooms of a local library, when a certain dolphin and anchor caught my eye. On display, opposite some vending machines is an Aldine octavo. It is open to the printer's device, so I don't know what the work is. However, judging from the call no. penciled in on the inside, it appears to be from 1534. It is in a regular glass display case (not sealed) with a cheapo display case lock. Doesn't this deserve better treatment? An Aldus Manutius printing is more than just an old book (at least to a typophile). Should I mention this to the library staff?\n\n",

      "content": "If it is in a case open to the printers device, they obviously know what it is. I was similarly astounded to see the exhibit put out for Typecon at the Buffalo Central library with minimal security: A Shakespeare first folio, A Kelmscott Chaucer and a few other gems.\n\n"

      "content": "They know what it is,probably; a first edition of Ginsberg's Howl is sitting nearby. I have to wonder if they simply don't have the proper storage. I am of the opinion that some things are better of being given to an institution that can properly store them. I'm sure this library will disagree, but it should probably be brought up.\n\n"
