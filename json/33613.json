  "content": "hi,  \ni'm working on my first text typeface and after skecthing out the first glyphs I've printed out of fontlab a couple of words to have an intial feel and see the weight of the characters and figure out the needed adjusments and variations. For the same purpose I've generated a font so i could look at it as a paragraph in Indesign and the printout looks totally different: bulky, blurred, much thicker than the fontlab version.  \nThen I generated a pdf file from the indesign file, print it out and get still another result. This time the typeface is closer to what I was expecting but ligther than the fontlab version.\n\nI've attached a file with the scans of the three printouts and a pdf with the actual font imbedded . Printer settings and paper are the same in the three situations.\n\nCan anyone help me understand what's going on?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TEXT\\_v3.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018211724/http:/typophile.com/files/TEXT_v3.pdf) | 10.35 KB |\n| [PrintoutScans2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018211724/http:/typophile.com/files/PrintoutScans2.pdf) | 304.01 KB |\n\n",
