  "content": "Hello,\n\nI want to do something to give back to my hometown, so i've come up with an idea for a pasty cook off. This would be an interface to strengthen and further bond Marquette, Michigan. Through pasties I hope to strengthen, facilitate and connect the community, as well as stimulate the local businesses.\n\nThe National Pasty Cookoff  \n2010 Marquette, Michigan\n\nI want to make a website and a poster series to begin the promotional process.\n\nI am breaking a few \"type rules\" using too many typefaces, but I want this to have a retro/vintage feel.  \nAny feedback about typography or ideation for the event itself would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you,\n\nDerrick\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 4.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417063640/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%204_68.png) | 395.59 KB |\n| [Picture 5.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417063640/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%205_58.png) | 23.66 KB |\n| [Picture 10.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417063640/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2010_18.png) | 28.45 KB |\n| [Picture 11.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417063640/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2011_17.png) | 29.58 KB |\n\n",
