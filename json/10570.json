  "content": "Dear all,   \n   \nI'm a Communication Design student at the University of Portsmouth. Being in the last year of the BA program, I have elected \"City Typography\" to be the subject of my final major project.   \n   \nI plan to create a magazine featuring the typography of a specific city in every issue. The first issue should be about typography in London and - of course - the people behind.   \nIn this context, one article should be about the personal impressions of city typography of designers and typographers in London. (It's really just one article of the hole magazine and I've done much other articles already. Just in case, you don't think that I want you to do my work!)   \n   \nThis topic is the reason for my mail.   \nIf you like my idea and want to help me to get through it, please read the following task:   \n   \nCreate a visual, which displays your own notion of� �The City Typography of London�.   \n   \nIt could be a picture, a few sentences, a drafted font or whatever you can imagine which reflects your own impression of London�s typography in the best way.   \n   \nPlease send me your input including your name/agency and preferably your reason for creating your work the way you did.   \n   \nI would be very grateful if you could help me with this matter.   \n   \nBest regards,   \n   \nInga Lange\n\n",
