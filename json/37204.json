  "content": "This weekend I came across ADDitude, a magazine for individuals with attention deficit disorder and their families. The design was remarkable—it was extremely attractive and attention-getting visually, but had a well-developed—and followed—hierarchy that was clearly designed to make it easy on readers with ADD. This got me wondering—are there more magazines out there _designed_ for readers with visual, reading, or learning disabilities?\n\n [‹ Petition 2: Edits stay in place (need authority figure to participate in discussion)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080207163412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37281 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New Book, \"Designing Typefaces\" ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080207163412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4058 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Chris, you might have more luck out there in Reston where there are a lot of people with kids.\n\nWe should get the designers to speak at Typecon next year. Of course, this all assumes that they actually design the magazine with ADD in mind, and that they don’t just handle hierarchies especially well.\n\n"

      "content": "I’ve got a profound hearing loss and therefore have a disability. I’ve got no issues with the word “disability”. However if people asked me the question, “are you disabled”, I’d simply answer “no” purely for political or social reasons. There are people who equate disability with “crippled” or someone with an inability to achieve anything substantial at all. This is a complete nonsense. A disability is simply an obstacle in life, if you can’t hear, see, taste, feel or walk, you gotta work around the problem like anything else, that’s all. It’s disappointing sometimes how people perceive disabilities but it’s improving all the time with increased understanding and also support for braille, captioning etc.\n\nI’m all for magazines about disabilities.\n\n"

I prefer terms like ’universal design’ as it is more inclusive of all people rather then exclusive.\n\nBut, that’s just me. No biggie either way.\n\n"

My stepson is legally blind and during his time at school, the Lighthouse was fantastic. Getting him schoolbooks in large type, on records (yep in those days it was still record albums) helping where they could. It’s a wonderful organization - and extremely helpful. They were located on 58th or 59th Street - and are probably still there plugging away. It’s been years since I’ve been in touch with them.\n\n"
