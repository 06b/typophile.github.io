  "content": "!Exclamachine Type Foundry releases a new disply font today. A horror/display typeface, **!the troubles** includes the basic ASCII character set, as well a proposed Irony Mark as a standard OpenType ligature. The narrow, deformed, broadly spaced letters adds an eerie vibe to any text. [http://www.exclamachine.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418203414/http:/www.exclamachine.com/ \"http://www.exclamachine.com\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418203414im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tt%20sampler%20small_4504.jpg)\n  \nTo include the Irony Mark at the end of a sentence, simply type a tilde immediately after a period, before a space, in any OpenType aware application. (This mimics the I.M. convention of affixing a tilde to facetious statements.) \n",
