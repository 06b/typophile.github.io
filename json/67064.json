  "content": "Hi, I'm looking for suggestions for a typeface for the header, right now I'm using \"Swift\" for all the text and \"Modern 216\" for the header, they feel like a mis-match. Any suggestions for a replacement for the body text or the header? Maybe a sans serif to counter the Swift and make the piece a little more contemporary?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185554im_/http:/typophile.com/files/textcrit_3980.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Swift was designed by Gerard Unger in 1985, and is more than capable of performing the task to which you have assigned it.\n\nFor the header, another design by Unger would certainly recommend itself. You may want to consult [a list of all his typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185554/http:/www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns01.html).\n\nIf for some reason you desire a Modern face, both [Coranto](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185554/http:/www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-coranto.html) and the earlier [Paradox](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185554/http:/www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Paradox_rdrct.html) are drawn in this style.\n\nCaranto as well as [Capitolium News](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185554/http:/www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-capitolium-news.html) both have specific Headline variants.\n\nFor a sans serif that is meant to be used for headlines, there is always [Big Vesta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185554/http:/www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-bigvesta.html).\n\nThese fonts and others can be [ordered directly from Gerard Unger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185554/http:/www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-howto.html).\n\n"
