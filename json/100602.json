So i tried to find that font again, nut only thing I found is font called KR Rachel's Elephants. It contains this elephant, but it has too low resolution... And the font i used to have, had the same picture of elephant but with much more details and better resolution. The clipart picture is in attachment. I hope anyone could help me find this font or have more detailed picture.... Thx :D\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Olifant.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014211446/http:/typophile.com/files/Olifant.gif) | 2.59 KB |\n\n",
