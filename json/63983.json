  "content": "Hi all,\n\nIt is said many a time that design a logo for one's self can be quiet difficult. Well, it has definitely been the case with me for a long time. I reckon I have had a 1000 different attempts at coming up with something 'clever' and eventually just give up for a few months before giving it another crack.\n\nThough, I am starting to settle my thoughts into having something...let's saying..'not so crazy'.\n\nWell, here it is below. Just a play on my initals. I quiet like this idea and where it is going...but I don't know. Throwing my hands up.\n\nOpen to all thoughts.\n\nThanks,  \nMattBurns\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116070651im_/http:/typophile.com/files/B_Logo_3817.gif)\n\n",
