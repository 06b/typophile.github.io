  "content": "My original inspiration derived from xerox waste sheets that I found interesting imagry on. From this I proceeded to build letterforms out of a specific section comprised of three images.   \n   \nThe conceptual idea was to try to hold on to the destructive quality of xerox duplication and cohesively form a systematic display face that can be used at small and large point sizes.   \n   \nAny input is greatly appreciated,   \nThanks ![xero](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023184854im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7447.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "poor frankie, no posts.   \ni think the overall attitude of this is pretty visceral, but the thickness of the forms makes it more approachable; like it's gritty but not in a scary way. it's surprising how well it holds up at that 12 pt size, which is real nice. i think the 3 needs a clearer middle horizontal stroke (not crossbar, but you know...), the \"xero\" title has the R shifted downward, but it's higher in the sample below. i think the lower position is nicer, and you may try that with a few u.c. and l.c. glyphs for a tiny bit more variety.\n\n"
