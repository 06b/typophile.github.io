I no longer use it for color work, it’s loud as hell, and has no postscript support. Can I get a decent postscript BW laser for less than what it’s going to cost me to refill this thing?\n\n",

I started off with them, switched to a NewGen/Design XP 1200 dpi printer for 4K and promptly went back to the HP when I could no longer afford the refills. Bad investment as the cartridges were 250$. I like the black crispness of the HP’s and they take a licking and keep on ticking!\n\nP.s. could you give me your addie so I can contact you about riding up to Buffalo.
