      "content": "I’ve been researching similar material - and if you want reproductions of the original printed examples rather than existing fonts, I can wholly recommend ’An Atlas of Typeforms’ by James Sutton & Alan Bartram, published 1967 by Lund Humphries (I think). Although it’s old and very large format, this should be available by library interloan, and I believe it carries examples of all three you’re looking for.  \nAdditionally, sample settings of the Caslon and the Figgins are both shown on p.20,21 of the old Baseline ’sans serif’ issue from 1991. The uppercase of the Caslon can be found on p.31 of Justin Howes ’Johnston’s Underground Type’ 2000 by Capital Transport.\n\n"
