But   \nthe tail of the Metro g continues further around the   \ncurve, and so does the top of the a; the Metro s has   \na more closed aperture top and bottom; the Metro w is   \nslightly narrower and quite idiosyncratic, with unequal   \ninterior and exterior angles; and the overall x-height   \nof Metro is proportionately a little larger.   \n   \nThis looks more like an import to me. I'm thinking   \nprobably Erbar. Unfortunately, there are no good online   \nsamples, as there has not yet been a digitization of the   \noriginal Erbar, not that I'm aware of.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

I'm attaching a sample for your consideration. It's my first serious text face and I'm quite fond of it.   \n   \nUpon a critique by Matthew Carter, he insisted there was no reason for this font to exist because Futura already existed :D   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013110106im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12264.gif)\n\n"

Your Metro sample is   \nfrom page 224 of the second volume from the set of   \nTypophile Chapbooks XXXV and XXXVI, _Postscripts on   \nDwiggins_ . This was begun shortly after WAD's death   \nas a commemorative and was published a couple   \nyears later in 1960.   \n   \n-- K.   \n   \nBTW, I'll probably be showing images of some of WAD's   \noriginal ink sketches for Metro as part of my TypeCon   \npresentation.\n\n"

(Look at the ending curves of   \nthe two n's -- each slightly different.) I suspect that it   \nwould have been impossible to space this tight as a   \nfont of individual sorts. Even on an angled body.   \n   \nMiddleton designed Coronet for Ludlow in 1937, so   \nit would have been _au courant._   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

Mac McGrew dates the light and bold weights as being made by Intertype in 1930. Medium and Extrabold coming in later years. Mac's book, American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, is an Oak Knoll publication, still available, case bound and perfect bound. It's a fine thing to have if for no other reason than to be able to satisfy one's self about identifying the naggingly familiar types that show up and drive us crazy.   \n   \nMy guess is that the masthead proper is a piece of good hand-lettering.   \n   \nJim\n\n"
