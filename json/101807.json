For this one, I don't have a match and I doubt there's one as almost all woodmarks from the fashion industry are custom lettering. I can only suggest 2 very (very...) loosely similar, [Kumlien](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223155809/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/kumlien-pro) and [Berling](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223155809/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/berling) and upload a better sample.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223155809im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bv_5252.jpeg)\n\n"
