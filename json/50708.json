      "content": "@James: Thanks for the compliment. I agree that it'd be nice to see this information in print. The website wound up taking the place of a printed catalogue for feasibility's sake. There's been some murmurs of possibilities of reassembling the show for some new venues in other cities - if that happens perhaps a printed catalogue would be possible. I also have thought the information might make for a good special issue of a design journal, but I haven't pursued that so far.\n\n"
