The themes I'm trying to convey are stability, dependability, precision, and harmony. I've reached that point where everything looks the same to me, and I don't really have anyone else to bounce this off of right now. Thanks!\n\n",

I love grids, I love simple geometric shapes, and I love the 1:4:9 proportions of the Clarke monolith, so combining that with print's most interesting (to me) and second most important (to me) color was a no-brainer.\n\nI chose DIN because of its visual similarity to the 4:9 ratio and modified the letterforms slightly to emphasize that. That the word \"MONOLITH\" fits perfectly inside the shape while retaining the 1:4:9 proportions is, I confess, a happy coincidence.\n\n"

At least that was what I had in mind when I designed [Rhodealian](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023125842/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/rhodaelian/). Rhodie's N and M are explicitly architectural, looking just like tall buildings in silhouette.\n\n_...how can you say HUGE without showing me two things?_\n\nHard to do.

Even so most examples still include an acronym with the visual element.\n\nFor a small design shop a graphic logo with no text at all, not even an acronym, might be too obscure. Keeping it simple generally produces good design, but given how minimal this one is, getting rid of the text altogether would make it reductive, and for clients, incomprehensible.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Aside from paying closer attention to letterspacing, I think B rules. As for the comments regarding \"how do you show huge without showing two objects\" and \"try stacking the lines,\" B illustrates the huge scale with the big rectangle vs. small type perfectly, and stacking the type would screw that up. Don't overthink or overdesign this one. It's too perfect. B!\n\n"

I'll take a closer look at it.\n\nLex & Koppa - My first thought was \"just the rectangle; do the simple strong shape you're always begging everyone else to try.\" And then I chickened out at the last minute, just like everyone else does. :) But I have to say that while it's nice to have a one color logo, the text inside the monolith cheapens it a little bit, gives it a weak footing. I really wanted to go with the one-color and stick with it, but after taking a few days off I have to say that I'm not so fond of the text inside and that Koppa's arguments are very persuasive.\n\nSim - I had done a lot of sketches where the object was built using the type, with \"RED\" as the front face and \"MONOLITH\" as the side, all put together at an extreme angle, but I just couldn't make it work.\n\nRobert - could you be more specific?\n\n"

Some observers, however, may reason that if the type is only a few inches high the rectangle, while much taller, must be only a few feet tall and hardly giant-scale. Depends on reproduction size and how philosophical you want to be about this. Adding an element of readily-recognized size, such as a human figure, would make the scale of things indisputable, but that's an intellectual conceit and there's a lot to be said for keeping things simple. It was just a passing thought.\n\nRobert, do you have the Flash 9 plugin installed?

It was a teaching machine that supercharged the apes and made them evolve.\n\nYou're right Red, it does make an interesting visual.

Will he work on business cards, on your site and in your marketing materials? I'm often frustrated when brands or a logo changes through different collateral. That being said, the little guy gives a whole different feeling to the logo in each representation. Go with your gut.\n\nI find many design shops and even large ad firms take a far too simplistic approach to their own brand (think DRAFTFCB). You're showing the fun and creativity behind your work. That's something I really like to see when looking for suppliers, especially in design.\n\nJames\n\n"
