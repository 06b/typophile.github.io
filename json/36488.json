Stephen, the sites you posted were good stuffs too (the kids are gonna love the Zoo site), and clauses, although your post are a bit off-topic, because i made a mistake of not mentioning ’simple objects of nature i.e. animal shapes, ornaments’, but your recommendation got me pondering the most, about a brilliant concept of using ’unfelt’ sense of nature into my design, i’ll look it up. More importantly, you guys showed me the true meaning and the fun of exploring various concepts when trying to come up with innovational but meaningful inventions.\n\np.s. My English is kinda broken, so forgive me...\n\n"

      "content": "the problem with all of these fonts is most of them (except tulip) are actual representation of ornaments or natural things that are inspired of nature. so they are more like photos, than typefaces.\n\nthe thing is, you need to look at pictures of the nature and not copy a flower per-se, but to seek a kind of “graphic language” or “behavior” in the nature. for example, i can take a metal spring. take pictures of it, bend it, stretch it, in order to see how it “behaves” in different poses. then make a design of typeface that emulates that springy behavior, but never forgets the legibility and the graphic nature of the latin type.  \nit’s like a hybrid.\n\n"
