  "content": "Recently I've been playing around with the idea of creating a font, and I decided to create a script font. Anyway, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here is what I've done so far:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423162319im_/http:/typophile.com/files/handwritingfont_4486.png)\n\nThe letter next to the a that looks like a 8 is a g. Anyway, I've been looking at it, and it resembles Comic Sans MS―not a good thing. I could try rewriting it with a smaller pen width; or is it fine as is? Should I go ahead and finish it?\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\n",

      "content": "You're scanning this guy in? I'd go for one of the thin sharpies and try again. Put more of your own natural touch to the letters. (I highly doubt you draw a lower case g like that.)\n\nA good thing to do is open up other fonts in your editing program, or in Illustrator, and look at the details of each letter-form.\n\nBut don't be afraid of the Comic Sans comparison. If you're just getting into designing a font, you could do worse :)\n\n"
