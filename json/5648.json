Anyway.   \n   \nCalliope, I don't think this is racy enough. You need more chaos... or dare I say, fury.   \n   \nAnd here's an idea to promote the \"genderness\": turn the top-left serif of the big \"R\" into a pony tail, maybe one that turns into flames at the tip(s). Too cheesy?   \n   \n--   \n   \nAnd Tiffany, what's \"fast\"?   \n   \n\\> They sit in the inside lane and basically   \n\\> expect you to pass them on the right.   \n   \nThat's when you pass them on the left anyway.   \nIt's easier at night though: get yourself some 100W Hellas with the left one pointed to the left mirror and the other to the rear view, move slghtly to the left, then roast corneas as needed. You'd be surprised at the quick and easy results. Except for the ones who raise _both_ hands to cover their eyes - those you should just go around quickly. After all the only safe car is the one behind you.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Considering the topic: the unusual mix of women and racing cars ... and considering this is a school project (where you should try be as radical in your solutions as you can) ... I don't think you should be satisfied with 'just' a namemark with type that merely hints racing.   \n   \nGo for the visual pun. Well, it could be a pony-tail (in itself a very good choise, connotating swiftness, youth, 'rebellion') replacing a part of the typography ... or something similar.   \n   \nI can see a solution here with a very humorous pun ... something like Luballin or Pentagram ...   \n   \n--   \nSoren O\n\n"

Only, I think these hints are so subtle that you could say: the typography says racing but it doesn't say girls ... on the other hand, it doesn't say anything irrelevant.   \n   \nWhether or not it should be the pun or the subtle solution, would depend on the media and the target audience.   \n   \n--   \nSoren O\n\n"

In the shadowed version: be   \ncareful of gaps that are so tiny they should be either widened or   \nclosed altogether.

If anything I suppose the Cap R in Racers could flip down or curve under but only if it followed form of the rest of the typeface. If it is subtle enough you could do it in all three Rs ... but if it starts to look like decoration I wouldn't do it. Perhaps you could use a fiery hot pink with nice bold black outlines and shadows or something, no pony tails .... unless it looks like a swash first and a ponytail last.   \n   \nI agree with Stephen's comment about spaces/gaps.   \n   \n--   \n   \nhrant ... i hit 115 the other day (not that fast I guess, compared to official race car driving). some punk thought he could out race me. i think he was flirting, but my mind was elsewhere so i was little mean (i suppose). felt good and then i realized how stupid it might have been. i think i need to find a local race track.\n\n"
