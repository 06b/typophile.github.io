      "content": "Quite impressive. My only gripe is with the lowercase /k/, which is historically accurate but rather confusing to someone not familiar with this particular rendering of the letter. The font might be more useful to a wider number of potential buyers if there were an alternate /k/ character, structured somewhat along the lines of the /sz/ ligature...IMHO. Otherwise, great stuff.\n\n"

It can be seen (somewhat hidden) in the fourth line, second word, of the third sample image above. Here's a bigger picture:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414034026im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WKS10_5709.png)\n  \nI don't know whether I got it right or not (I think I did), but I sure didn't like the modern /k/ in Adobe/Linotype's Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch, with its diagonal leg disrupting the darkness and vertical patterning of the lowercase \"textura\".\n\nBest wishes.\n\n"

Great job.\n\nI'm not sure whether it's helpful to the cause of blackletter in this age if you quote Koch's _haarsträubende_ quotation in the marketing materials, though. :P\n\nIs that epic drop-cap {I} also part of the font...?\n\n"

Very nice typeface though.\n\nBut I am curious to know: I like this a lot but could not find any modern application for it beyond perhaps a beer label. Do people use it to render historical texts accurately, so in that sense is it a purely historical reconstruction, or have you seen possible examples of modern usage?\n\n"

For modern uses of blackletter in general, you might have a look, for example, at \" [Slanted Magazin #10 – Heavy Metal. Lovers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414034026/http:/slanted.de/shop/slanted-magazin-10-heavy-metal-lovers).\" As a nice aside, I was gladly surprised a few months ago when I saw a [recent release](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414034026/http:/www.saxon747.com/en/index.php/band/releases/260) by rock veterans Saxon which made use of a somewhat popular version of Wilhelm Klingspor Schrift for some of the text. No hard rules, however: use blackletter at your discretion and see whether it fits your purpose. And finally, I would really like to include Yiddish in the font, but that is well beyond my (limited) knowledege of different languages.\n\nThanks again.\n\n"
