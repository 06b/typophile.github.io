I think it's less of a problem at the smaller sizes, but that it would help the color to be more even.\n\n--Jim K.\n\nedit: Perhaps o should be taller too.  \n2nd edit: Best. Username.

I think it's important that you keep the italic structure; you've done a really elegant job of pairing it with a geometric treatment and to me that's really the promising feature of these letters. Just tilting it slightly back into balance will (hopefully) resolve that issue...\n\n"
