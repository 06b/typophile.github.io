I saw it (badly antialiased in flash) in the website [www.sagmeister.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516104006/http:/www.sagmeister.com/ \"www.sagmeister.com\"). I think titles are set in Gotham, but the body copy has slight differences, that part away from gotham, giving it a little more rectangular angles.  \nCan anyone help?  \nThanx.\n\n",
