They wanted something elegant, that was type based. Now I know it's Trajan (yes I know, burn me at the stake), but they probably don't want to stump up for Requiem.\n\nJust interested to know what you guys think, as it's one of only a few logos I've done which really focus on type forms instead of more \"in yer face\" graphic device based identities.\n\nBe gentle, but firm!\n\nThanks\n\nSteve\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo6.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820121626/http:/typophile.com/files/logo6.jpg) | 30.87 KB |\n\n",

I found that without the rotation, once I had shaved the top off it, it seems to be visually leaning over. It's only a few degrees, so hopefully it hasn't changed the character of the remaining glyph.\n\n"

Perhaps if you were to remove the center diamond from the ornament the lack of alignment would be less noticable.\n\nOverall though, a good solution for the logo.  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_When going from_ A to Z,  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I often end up_ At Oz.\n\n"

As for the lines at the bottom, another face perhaps..too much of Trajan gives me a bad taste in the mouth. Maybe Gotham or something similar at the bottom? Or maybe a slab serif.
