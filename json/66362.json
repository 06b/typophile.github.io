The title of the newsletter is \"The Porch and Breeze,\" and the name lets you know mostly everything they're going for in the look and feel.\n\nI'm leaning towards Garamond for the body text, but I think the headers will really be setting the mood of the piece. I've considered Mrs. Eaves and Feijoa, but I wanted to hear any other suggestion you kind folks might have for a face that harkens \"the good ole days\" without being kitschy.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

Perhaps a bit to narrow for the application here, going to try and be thorough in using various weights. I didn't mention that I'll also likely be setting the paper's title in the same face. (I hesitate to call it a logo.) I'm going to play with it some more though; it's certainly evocative.\n\n@pcarter Very interested in the luxury family. I'd never seen that one from House before; looking deeper into it; thanks so much!\n\n"
