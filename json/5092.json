The two fonts are very similar because they are by the same designer, Hans Reichel, who did Sari after failing to come to an agreement over his earlier design with Berthold Types when they acquired the H. Berthold type library. (I only just learned this today [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224128/http:/www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?4100/37440).)\n\n"

Thank you very much Mr. Simonson.   \nAnd what do you think about a typeface like this being used as newspaper headline?
