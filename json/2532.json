      "content": "Swapping the characters is itself a breeze, it�s the programming of diacritic combinations (e.g., accent aigu and all the vowels) that begins getting a bit taxing. Also, the fact that the Control modifier on all the alphanumeric keys only works in certain programs is bothersome. I guess I�ll keep plugging away. But if anyone uses Windows and wants a keyboard with handy quotes and correct dashes and Mac-esque diacritics, I can upload the layout somewhere (I also believe the Microsoft tool has an packager capability).\n\n"
