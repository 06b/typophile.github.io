If you're switching, it's typically better to switch to something completely different. What do you want your font to convey about your firm?\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Hrant,\n\nI agree with your comment in reference to switching to something different, although my intension is to first see what else is out there (that I might not be aware of)  \nI may or may not make a switch, but I do think it is good to scope out some other options.\n\nIn terms of what the font should convey about my work I'd like something that says \"modern, elegant, simple, clean, smart\" with a subtle touch of femininity.\n\nOn that same note, if you visit my website you'll see that I have a somewhat feminine logomark, which is the most prominent part of my identity. So, the typeface should mainly accommodate this mark both on my website and the stationery materials that carry it.\n\nHope this explains what I'm looking for a bit better..\n\nLet me know if you have any thoughts/feedback!\n\nThanks!\n\n.A\n\n"

      "content": "Ayda, although your logo has some feminine traits (it's \"wispy\", and  \nmysterious) it also has some masculine ones (symmetry, rigidity of line).  \nSo the first thing that popped into my mind was Kursivschrift:  \n [http://www.identifont.com/samples/linotype/KursivschriftStehend.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201054315/http:/www.identifont.com/samples/linotype/KursivschriftStehend.gif \"http://www.identifont.com/samples/linotype/KursivschriftStehend.gif\")\n\nI like some of Jonathan's suggestions too (although I couldn't find Effra).\n\nBTW, concerning what Stefan said, of course for any text on your site that  \nis actual text, you should choose a font that matches your identity. But  \nusing a web font for all parts of your identity is unnecessarily restrictive.\n\nhhp\n\n"
