Have you created fonts for English or some other Latin language?  \nPeople spend years creating a font.  \nThere are lots of free fonts for Hebrew.\n\n"

The Hebrew range in the Linux Libertine font also is a Vilna style font.\n\nYou'll find both of them in the [Open Siddur open source and Unicode Hebrew font pack](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114315/http:/opensiddur.org/tools/fonts/).\n\nNote there are some issues with diacritic placement with this font which needs fixing.\n\n"
