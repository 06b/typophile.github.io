Particularly with rough-ish edges so it has a hand drawn look?\n\nThanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [fonts.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20091128134847/http:/typophile.com/files/fonts.gif) | 328.36 KB |\n\n",

Use Part 6 for sans lettering styles (maybe Part 5 has some too), and Part 7 for the connected script styles. Grungier, bouncier fonts are in Part 14.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
