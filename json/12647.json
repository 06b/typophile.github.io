  "content": "Was playing around today instead of getting ready for a pitch.\n\nCame up with a few type treatments, based on exisiting or heavily modified fonts -- not sure what to do with them, maybe tshirts? I am seriously getting tired with clip-art and faux naive illustration art tshirts.\n\nNeed more, solid, type treatments on t-shirts in the future, mayhaps?\n\nI dunno.\n\nDo tell me what you think!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [brain.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021054702/http:/typophile.com/files/brain.gif) | 13.39 KB |\n| [dialahawkts.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021054702/http:/typophile.com/files/dialahawkts.gif) | 9.91 KB |\n| [poet\\_laureate.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021054702/http:/typophile.com/files/poet_laureate.gif) | 5.01 KB |\n\n",

But, there is a question of balance that needs to be addressed.\n\nI think the kerning in the 70s was so tight, partly because of the jeans. There was a subconsious need to keep everything 'packed in' due in part to the tightening in their crotches!\n\n"
