  "content": "Hi everyone.\n\nI’ve been looking for this font for a while now. I’ve tried WhatTheFont.com’s services as well as Identifont but obviously without any luck.\n\nSo far I’ve found some similar ones like Alien League, Steelfish, Univers Condensed etc. However, as close as they may seem, none of them are the exact font. The reason I know is because the ’3’ has a straight line (as you can see in the photo) and all these other fonts have the double curves.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.  \nThank you!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [help.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907171738/http:/typophile.com/files/help_0.jpg) | 241.76 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Xepto logo condensed grotesque - Helvetica Cd {Matt S}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907171738/http:/typophile.com/node/18303 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Health Services\" similar to ITC Officina Sans - MS Trebuchet {Tiff} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907171738/http:/typophile.com/node/18297 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

What suggests this possibility to me is the A without the crossbar; the slash O with the slash going in the wrong direction; and the 3, which is really a 5, slightly modified (actually, it’s a combination of a 5 and a 7).\n\n"
