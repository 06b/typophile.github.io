In fact, there were a large variety of Grotesques/Gothics with numbers which seem to include many that are at least similar. Each foundry had their own ’flavors’ of these sans serif workhorses, and film types had a spectrum of widths and weights and stylistic variations, which could be further varied by using lenses. I think this may be very hard to pin down exactly.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I’ve never actually seen it, but the timing makes sense and the influences of the design too. They didn’t actually name it, but I’ve seen sources where people refer to it as Airport.\n\nIf I’m not mistaken, it was never produced as a usable font, not even then... I remember reading it was pasted up on the signage from Photostats, although I don’t even really know what those are.\n\nruD\n\n"
