What’s going on?</cite>\n\nNothing special :-)\n\nBoth 'cmap' and 'name' tables have more than a single data entry. To discern between entries, each one is prefixed with salient details. Platform is important because the default character maps differ significantly between Mac and Windows. Additionally, traditionally, Mac char maps were 8 bits -- so for different languages, it had different mappings (entirely similar to ye olde DOS/Windows code pages). So a font just has loads of mappings, each one prepended with a system and a language code.\n\nNames is sort of the same story. What if you have an accented character in a name string -- say, the designer's name? Should you use Mac standard encoding, Windows standard encoding, or Unicode? The canonical solution was: put it all in. Even though the 21st century solution is to use Unicode for everything, Macs historically expect a Macintosh version.\n\nI deliberately say \"historically\", because I'm pretty much convinced with OSX it's no longer an issue. Those in the know may correct and/or amend to this, but I think both cmaps and names are chosen purely by 'best fit' (transcending encoding and platform), instead of insisting on a Norwegian style name encoded in a Windows Norwegian 8 bit code page for a Norwegian OS.\n\nSo, what's going on? \"Better safe than sorry\" applies--as well as \"Standards are good--let's have lots of them\". A not-too-bad-coded font may be useable on any modern system (Win XP, Vista, OSX, or one of the more advanced linux desktops), but a font with all bells and whistles in every table is usable on your old Mac SE.\n\n"

However there is no reason to do that manually, as FontForge just automatically adds the first 3 glyphs (if they are missing) when outputting a TTF font. Of course, one would normally design the .notdef glyph manually and allow FontForge to create other two.\n\nThus fonts generated with FontForge perfectly comply the recommendation at this point. You can check this by opening a TTF font file you have just generated and switching the encoding to \"Glyph Order\".\n\n"
