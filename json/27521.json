  "content": "I'm working on a website design, and I'm currently looking with my client for a font for headings graphics throughout the site.\n\nOne of the fonts we considered is Bannikova from Paratype, but in my eye something is wrong with the digitization. It's a beautiful and very unique Soviet typeface designed by Galina Bannikova in the 1950s.\n\nI'll let you guys judge whether the quality is good enough for use in a design (with a little manual kerning). Once again, it's only for some headings to be read on screen. I'd also like to hear suggestion for similar typefaces.\n\nHere are a couple images:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414095818im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bannikova2_6636.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414095818im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bannikova_4625.png)\n  \n&nbsp;  \nThe corresponding Identifont page: [Link](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414095818/http:/www.identifont.com/show?GG)  \n&nbsp;  \nI'm especially drawn by the beautiful serifs and \"organic\" letterforms. \n",

I don't only need to tweak the kerning, I even have to position some of the letters vertically. Like, consider the uppercase \"B\" [in this example](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414095818/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=PG.109426.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Bay+City&sampleSize=48).\n\nBy the way, here's how Bannikova was probably supposed to look before digitization: [Link](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414095818/http:/babich.spb.ru/pics/lj_pix/Bannikova/Baikonur1b.jpg) (I only need the western alphabet, though).\n\n"

Screen typography is so easy because of the low resolution, it's mostly only a question of style. Don't have to worry that much about legibility problems, eye flow or stuff like that.\n\n"
