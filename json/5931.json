I was gonna use Nick's Team Spirit font, but I used that last year and it's a bit too cute for what i was going for this time around. Anyhow, I've tried to incorporate your suggestions. If you could take a look again and lemme know whatcha think, I'd appreciate it. thnx again!   \n   \nOh and BTW, the official Little League logo (as far as I know) is the logo on the banner that the girls are holding.   \n   \n<!--attachment: LLtab-42165.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*1572.8*Tab+Cover*LLtab%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20051109095117im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">Tab Cover<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20051109095117/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/LLtab-42165.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>LLtab.pdf</b></a> (1572.8 k)</td></tr></table>\n</center><!--/attachment-->\n"
