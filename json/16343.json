I had this weird thought: If, in some bizarre alternate history, chatspeak abbreviations like \"LOL\" had become popular long before there were computers and character sets, they might have, over time, become new symbols, like \"et\" became \"&\" and \"at\" became \"@\". What might they look like?\n\n",

The at sign has that hairline loop in the early model which leads to varying solutions when type designers try to adapt it to other styles. In some cases, like adapting the Euro to older face, you get to rewrite history in a sense, and try to imagine how it would have been done had it existed. The ampersand is a good example of the range of solutions which are possible, not all of which are fully embraced by type users (e.g., the original and later Univers ampersand).\n\nJust for fun, here's a Jenson-like variation:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316235441im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wtf-os.png)\n\n"

If some hot rapper comes up named \"Ωman\", I'm sure that we'll start to see the Omega everywhere.\n\nIn a general purpose font - read: created for graphic designers doing general design work, not specialists setting math textbooks, which require far more specialised glyphs than those listed above - it seemed perfectly reasonable to fill those slots with something fun and potentially useful. And the design of the \"w\" lent itself to this treatment.\n\nA couple of the Thirstype fonts from this same period featured the glyph then being used by Prince as his name.\n\n"
