      "content": "This is indeed nice.   \n   \nI like all the detail you have put into it with the traps and attention to consistency. I agree with eduardo.   \n   \nI addition, I might focus my attention of the figures. Generally the color should fit somewhere between the caps and lower case.   \n   \n2: Modulation is wierd.   \n3: Modulation issues coming out of the waist (too thick too quick)   \n5: Modulation also odd. More horizontal emphaisis in the waist?   \n7: Light. Add some more to the taper at the bottom.   \n0: Dark.   \n1: Also, maybe a hair dark.   \n   \nfi: The terminal on the f is too much like a circle and doesn't flow naturally from the stem.   \n   \nWell done!\n\n"

      "content": "Pretty nice! And complex.   \n   \nYou have a lot of variety in the serifs. Keep that divergence, but I think it needs a little bit of taming, like in the \"j\" I'd use the round/flat style (like in the \"f\") instead. The only glyphs that really don't work for me are the \"k\" (you need to terminate the leg much stronger) and the \"y\" (new tail). The \"g\" is great!   \n   \nThe caps are really classy - nice going. The \"3\" needs weight. Your \"fi\"/\"fl\" ligs seem forced.   \n   \nTrapping is great, but it needs to be made consistent. Use Flower Power!   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_trapping1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417143020/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html)   \n   \nBTW, your weight is slightly heavy for typical text. But your vertical proportions are great.   \n   \nSpacing: needs work, and is a hair loose overall (at least at that weight).   \n   \nThis is a very promising design - I hope you take it all the way!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Rodrigo   \n   \nI like this serif!   \n   \nHere my critique   \nMany of this is a question of flaver ;-)   \n   \nlc 'a': Downstrok-serif is very heavy   \n   \nThe angel of the dick/thin contrast seams to be very different. I like it in lc 'e' and 'c' but i.e. lc 'o' or lc 'g' has another angel. Also the Uppercase... but maybe u have to fix the lc 'e' and lc 'c'. But as i just said I like the e and c more ;-)   \n   \nlc 'y': like eduardo said to weak and I also agree to the to heavy dieresis   \n   \nAlso you should check the horizental lines. It seams that there are many diffrences.   \n   \nAlso check the lc 'g'. The h-lines seams also different weight.   \n   \nThe Tail of the Q should end like the upstroke serif of the lc 'g'   \n   \nGreetings to you and go on!   \nJens\n\n"
