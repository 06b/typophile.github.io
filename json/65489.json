Register using your .edu email address and we'll keep you up to date about specials.\" This suggested to me that as a student I am privy _only_ to special promotions, not to a general discount. I now see that \"special discounts\" could mean \"a set of great low prices,\" but at the time I read it as \"only those fonts we let you know about are available at lower prices.\"\n\nDid the education site not once explicitly state the 10% discount? Though I understand if you don't want to put out an unqualified discount like this.\n\n"
