  "content": "I'm building a product showcase with Flash that is translated into multiple languages. The translations are handled with Text files. e.g., we send the files to Poland, and all the dealer needs to do is open up a text file, translate the text and voila, they have a Polish version of the showcase. Easy-peasy.   \n   \nThe problem we're running into is that the showcase uses our corporate font (Frutiger). We embed the font's outlines in the Flash file, but when someone needs language-specific characters, some of the content comes up missing. If we switch the font to Verdana (or any basic system font), most everything seems to show up (from the small amount of testing we've done).   \n   \nNow my question, is it possible to embed an OpenType version of Frutiger and expect it work in multiple languages? Is there a better way to support multiple languages?\n\n",

      "content": "Not knowing much about Flash, an obvious question is, \"Does an embedded version Verdana (with the real Verdana removed from the machine) display correcty?\"   \n   \nIf so the problem would most likely be with Frutiger. Maybe use Font Validator to see if all the codepage and Unicode range bits are set correctly, or if the font has other errors.   \n   \nIf the embedded Verdana fails then the problem is likley with Flash itself - either in it's Unicode support or in it's subsetting of the font (removing the Polish characters).   \n   \nSi\n\n"
