      "content": "The bowls of the b, d, p, and q seem a little uneven and perhaps unbalanced in spots. In the q it seems to be sagging to the bottom a little. The descender of the g seems to have a sharper curve in the upper left than it does anywhere else, and flattens out along the right. My eyes also want to see the stem not flow directly into the arches on the top of the m and n (also ear of r, bottom of u), but raise up like where p, q and d attach to the bowls. In these same instances, it seems as if those curves a re a little unbalanced, and the arches/ears/bowls become too gradual as they approach the stems.\n\nIt's hard to judge the typesetting without caps to reference the proportions.\n\n"
