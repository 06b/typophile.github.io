We'll keep looking!   \n   \nOn a side note, I was just telling another fellow searcher that when you post on the type ID section, it helps if you give the thread a more descriptive name. Otherwise, particular searches get difficult to locate among the many threads.   \n   \nGood luck with this one.\n\n"
