I am convinced that working in the black rather than Notan is what 99% of practitioners do. But I also think that what 99% of all ’makers of letters’ in all techniques/process’ do. Going to Notan is an very expert shift not easily done. While I am open to hearing more about the ’rhythmic bond of the white forms’ I have to admit to remaining skeptical of that as well. It isn’t that I don’t see that there is something to what GN is saying. It’s just that I think it’s a very incomplete way of looking at it.\n\nAlso re: the actual topic of the thread. I think that it is reasonable to show your image as long as you don’t make great claims to precise historical accuracy simply because lots of scribes used multiple styles and the style they used was related to content and the desire of their patron. The problem with writing about calligraphic styles over time is that the actual complexity is extremely hard to wrap your head around and harder still to explain so less than accurate generalizations are made. The tendency to write in authoritative modern style ’ This is how it was ’ vs a postmodern more scientific ’These are my observations - these are my sources’ further compounds the problem. But as I say. There is no reason to present the thing as a modernist.\n\n"

That is, did the ‘evolution’ Steven illustrated compromise or damage bouma divergence. And if so, how can we now thread our way effectively—typographically—through the countervailing pressures flanking writing.

      "content": "Peter,\n\nWould you elaborate on what you mean by ’consolidation’? The more common or superficially obvious sense especially for lay-person is I assume the incorrect interpretation. That is simply that the horizontal space required gets smaller with the movement to blackletter ( Fractur, Textura, Shwabacker etc) because the letters become narrow.\n\nWhat I am guessing he might mean instead is that the forms being used become more regular and the picket fence effect that results creates a greater regularity or rhythm than we see in the carolingian minuscule. Maybe he means more than this.\n\nYou (I think) push things further to say that this regularity might have an additional benefit - that the regularity forms a background against which differences between letterforms may be highlighted more effectively resulting in enhanced cue value and faster recognition.\n\nI suspect I have made a mess of this but it’s my understanding of what you might mean as of today. Please correct me where I have misunderstood or mischaracterized either of you or GN.\n\nPersonally I don’t think that regularity of form -at least at the level of blackletter- is needed. The reason I think this has to do with Andre Gurtler’s work. The exercises he did with his students suggest to me that there are potentially many kinds of regularity in latin forms beyond those we see in blackletter. And also that these kinds are not less than the ones used by blackletter.\n\nHis examples also suggested to me that Blackletter which is hyper regular like a Textura is sub-ideal where cue value is concerned. And maybe blacletter is too regular in general to be ideal.\n\nHowever, for me, successful Notan requires no regularity whatsoever. The way I look at it it’s the latin forms that need a degree of regularity in order to be Latin. And so getting successful Notan going with that regularity doesn’t require a particular degree of regularity. It might be that there is some kind of ideal range of regularity for Latin though. And that’s a different issue.\n\nI am of course curious about what each of you has to say about these ideas.\n\n"

      "content": "_The Random House dictionary of the English Language_: To consolidate is “ **1.** to bring together (separate parts) into a single whole; unite; combine. **2.** to make firm or secure, to strengthen.”\n\nAccenting the rhythmic bond of the whites unites or makes strong or secures the word image. Another way of saying this is that it enhances the object-like integrity (for perceptual processing) of the word image. One could say it is an ingredient in acheiving typographic notan.\n\nTextura does this by making the word image more compact, the interior and between-letter shapes more comparable to themselves and eachother, and the black / white balance more equal.\n\nConsolidation is important in a perspective which considers reading to be, what we have been calling, ’bouma-based.’ It’s perceptual processing importance is more difficult to see if one adopts a parallel letter recognition model of word recognition.\n\nTo my sense of it the ’danger’ in textura is the loss of independant cue value in many areas. The regularity of textura limits bouma divergence.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>fairly tight packing (as shown in fourier transforms) around a phasal mean\n\nPeter, doesn’t that ’tight packing around a phasal mean’ in fact indicate regularity?\n\nMy own view is that regularity is essential to good readability—as is variety. A large degree of regularity is needed to provide a framework the eye can latch on to, and know where to look for variety. The diversity of forms within that regular framework is the ’signal’ that we read, and the regularity provides the necessary framework to detect the variations, the signal—such as the difference between a b and an h.\n\nIf there is a lot of variation in the design that does not convey key information, then that excess variation becomes ’noise’ that interferes with readability. For example, if some characters are much darker than others, like mixing bold and light in the same word, it interferes with readability. Or, like University Roman, where the mn are very narrow, and the bdo very wide. If there is evenness of color, and the counters and letter spaces are all in balance, I think readability is greatly enhanced.\n\nOne of the great challenges in designing a text type with superb readability is to get the balance of regularity and variety right.\n\n"

      "content": "The best place to look at what I am thinking about is in Andre Gurtler’s book ’Experiments With Letterform and Calligraphy’.\n\nIt’s expensive but maybe a Library can get you a copy. I could also scan some stuff to cite examples. Let me know how it goes.\n\nISBN-10: 3721203208  \nISBN-13: 978-3721203202\n\nAlso, thanks for the definition. ( Really! ) Your comments make more sense now.\n\nI am still unclear how the regularity/rhythmic bond/consolidation enhances the integrity of the word. It makes the word more compact but surely it is the spaces between the words that make the word into an object. That and line spacing. Below that level you have letter relationships. I do see that some degree of regularity is desirable. What I suspect we probably differ over is how tight is ideal. So maybe it isn’t that I don’t see what regularity has to do with it. Maybe it’s that I am not sure why we need ’fairly tight’ or why you think that’s the sweet spot. And really I am not sure how tight fairly tight is. It is possible we already agree without a sample to refer to it’s hard to know.\n\nBut here is my point again and if I am preaching to the choir please forgive me: Notan isn’t a just balance of black & white in the sense that a 50-50 evenness is achieved. Thus regularity per se may mean almost nothing in itself in terms of making Successful Notan in type. I say ’just’ because even a 50/50 balance could be an element in successful Notan. But for most letters successful Notan has to be a pleasing optical balance of the asymmetric. And we know that litteral symetry isn’t tollerated by the eye all that well. We need subtle asymmetry & illusions to make the eye happy with what is meant to be seen as symmetric.\n\nFurther I think 90% of Cue Value in Latin lives there in the obvious asymmetries. This is why I think Notan & Cue Value are far more deeply related than consolidation or regularity are to either Cue Value or Notan.\n\nAlso, would you expand on what ’fairly tight packing’ is like. Reading & reading what you wrote just keeps bringing to mind glyph variations where the core shapes are very similar but not the same - and I have no way of knowing if that’s the kind of thing you mean.\n\nWhat would be lovely is if you could show an example of type or calligraphy that demonstrated this fairly tight packing and could also be contrasted with literal regularity.\n\n"

I should have said, absolute, salient, on-phase periodicity is probably anatgonistic to readability.\n\nEben, I wonder if [these two slides](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007183414/http:/www.enneson.com/public_downloads/typophile/tightpacking_slides.pdf) from my UQAM talk help in elucidating what I mean by fairly tight packing. They show that in readable, well-spaced types, information from the vertical components of the letters in the words falls at intervals close to a phasal mean. Notice that the highlights on the horizontal axis are not thin vertical stripes, but fuzzy verticle elipses. I take this clustering around a phasal mean to be one of the key signatures of readable Latin type. I would expect the fourier transforms of non-latin scripts to reveal a rather different picture. In the transforms shown, there are no competing phasal peaks on the x, or horizontal, axis, and the information is not mechanistically on-phase. I would expect that a fourier transform of textura will show much more ‘on-phase-ness’ in the horizontal direction of writing.\n\nBut the rhythmic cohesion set up by this phasal structure binds the cluster of glyphs into an objext-like entity resistant to what I have been calling ’slot-processing.’ That is, the rhythmic cohesion promotes the consolidation of the word.\n\n"

If the shapes are fairly consistent then you have a tight phasal mean? If so, a Textura that has ’lapsed into uniformity’ would be the extreme example. Futura’s lower case would fit nicely too but the Upper Case would not. Something with a lot of width variation in the Lower Case might not. A Monospace might adhere fairly closely to the ’phasal mean’as well . Is this right?\n\nThe odd thing about this idea is that it seems to be working against the idea - not absolutely; you have made that clear, that glyph divergence or distinctiveness is a good idea.
