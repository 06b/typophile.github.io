(Heck, what would this mean for typophile.com?)\n\nHow about motion graphics on the web? Or is this a VCR / Betamax situation—answerable simply by asking which does the porn industry support? There's an excerpt (the \"they\" refers to Adobe):\n\n\"They are lazy, Jobs says. They have all this potential to do interesting things but they just refuse to do it. They don’t do anything with the approaches that Apple is taking, like Carbon. Apple does not support Flash because it is so buggy, he says. Whenever a Mac crashes more often than not it’s because of Flash.\n\nNo one will be using Flash, he says. The world is moving to HTML5.\"\n\n",

Even if every Mac user buys an iPhone/iPad tomorrow Apple’s Flashless devices will still have a smaller user base than Opera or Chrome, neither of which is relevant commercially. And the iPad could very well be the next Apple TV, which, like the iPad, was great, awesome, amazing, and totally going to destroy a bunch of stuff, and has turned out to be little more than a hacking platform for basement dwellers who lack the social skills required to play WoW.\n\nBut I do think that all this speculation is a sign that Flash is on its way out. A few years ago Flash/Flex seemed to have a brilliant future ahead and now we’re all salivating at the thought of a web with no Flash at all. If this is an omen of how we can expect feelings about Flash to trend it seems like the Adobe/Macromedia buyout will be right up there with AOL buying Time Warner in the history of corporate takovers gone horribly wrong.\n\n"

Does that also apply to people who jailbreak their iPhones, or other forms of hacking that improve a device?\n\nSteve Jobs and Apple will have little or nothing to do with the acceptance of HTML5 nor the killing of Flash on the web. Like any web standard, it takes years for adoption rates to catch up. IE6 was \\*just\\* bumped by IE8 in most-used browser in the world. HTML5 does not work in IE6, but it does play Flash. If a web browser nearly a decade old is still being used by this many people, it's going to take a very long time for HTML5 to completely replace Flash as a go-to source for video on the web. Flash is still a great platform for online games, as well, something you won't see replaced by HTML5 anytime soon. So while the battle lines may have been drawn by the outspoken Apple leader, it represents very little more than the frustrations of one man lashing out at a company he wishes would develop software that worked better on his OS. That gripe, of course, is a two way street.\n\nHTML5 is here, it's great, and it simplifies a lot of things. But it's going to have to share the spotlight with Flash at best, and that's not going to change anytime soon.\n\n"

Now Flash has become omnipresent, it requires at least a technologically equal alternative to displace it, even by a monopolistic platform provider. The problem is that HTML5, JavaScript and SVG are still no match for Flash in the visual department (vector animation, advance typography etc.), so there's no immediately available replacement in sight.\n\nTo summarize, the death of Flash by the hand of Apple would require (1) Apple becoming a monopolistic mobile provider (which isn't happening with Google joining the game), and (2) mobile becoming a deciding factor for the web (which will happen eventually, but not in the next few years), and (3) Apple starting to embrace competing technologies (which it hasn't so far -- in fact, Apple was a major blocker of the recently failed HTML5 Video standardization attempt), and (4) the alternatives out-innovating Flash (which is extremely difficult given the snail pace at which W3C and co. move compared to Adobe) .

However, I don't think that's a huge amount of content one would be missing.\n\nFor the typical use of flash...gaming, I'm not sure a touch-based mobile device would even work for that.

Fortunately, for that there are solutions now that help migrate a flash app into an iPhone app and, I'm guessing, other mobile OS apps soon.

I'm rather glad Apple decided to acknowledge this.\n\nI really do hope that Flash dies as a format, but as a program, may it live on.\n\nAlso, regarding more accurately the actual topic and attempting to steer my wild tangent, the death of flash on the web means little to typography. Viva la CSS3!\n\n"
