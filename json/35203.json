Tiffany also commisioned Pantone to come up with a special Pantone Tiffany Blue (PMS 1837 as in the year the company was founded) for their boxes, bags and other collateral (Print March/April 2004).\n\nIt just bugs me that Tiffany keeps mixing Sterling with Helvetica in their ads. It's like commisioning a custom Ferrari and then buying floor mats at Costco.\n\n"
