  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am trying to generate clean SVG fonts.  \nI was using the batik font converter ( [http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/font-converter.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824061313/http:/xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/font-converter.html \"http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/font-converter.html\"))…  \nBut for some reason it seems to skip some glyphs. Can't manage to get the euro sign for example.\n\nTried with FontForge as well, no success at all.  \nWhat are you guys using? At best not fontsquirrel… ?\n\nAgain, it seems our favorite tools are lacking quite important functions.  \nNot really happy about relying on some command line found through browsing the internet.\n\n",

      "content": "I don’t use SVG fonts myself (it is a very limited font format when it comes to fonts for complex scripts. which is what I generally work on), but FontForge can be scripted and called from regular Python scripts (unlike FontLab which I’m told you have to run the scripts inside its GUI), which is almost certainly how Font Squirrel is calling it. There is also a “native” FontForge scripting language that I often use for quick stuff, so to convert any font format that FontForge can read to SVG from command line, I’d use something like this `fontforge -lang=ff -c 'Open($1); Generate($1:r+\".svg\")' fontname.ttf`, which should create a `fontname.svg` file in the current directory.\n\n"
