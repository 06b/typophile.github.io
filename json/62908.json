      "content": "You can do pretty useful things with re-ordering glyphs. One might think the Unicode order would be most useful, but since InDesign (for example) can order glyphs by Unicode order _or_ by Glyph ID (which would be your custom order), you can group \"similar\" glpyhs together. Minion Pro uses that; in Unicode order, Greek and Latin Extended characters are scattered all along the glyphs window, whereas in GID/CID order they are nicely grouped together.\n\nI used this trick in my own phonetic font to group all variants of a's, all b's, etc. together. I'm not ashamed to confess I put the open o 'ɔ' next to the c, the sybilant l 'ʎ' next to 'y', and the short a 'ʌ' next to 'v' -- that's where _I_ would look for these! (As I am not a trained linguist; I see rotated characters instead.)\n\n"
