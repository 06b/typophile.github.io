  "content": "I'm in the initial process of developing a logo for a friend's business, My PC Handyman. I'm looking for some concepts to work up. It's a little bit of a clunky name, but I think there's potential as well. I have considered using a toolbox theme, a more digital theme, as well as his idea of a figure carrying a computer.   \n   \nMy concern is the name and if I add a graphic that it might be distracting to the name. I'm also conerned about the 'PC' part. I don't want it to get lost and hopefully PC is interpretted properly.   \n   \nAny thoughts?   \n   \nThanks,   \nAdam\n\n",
