  "content": "After dropping off my son at daycare on Monday morning, I took a big gulp of coffee, did that interlocking-finger-knuckle-cracking-thing, and sat down at my computer, ready to get some work done. Instead, I checked Twitter. Of course, my feed was immediately confronted with the week’s latest distraction (NSFW), a Tumblr entitled [Fonts & Boobs](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042359/http:/fonts-n-boobs.tumblr.com/).\n\nThe concept is pretty simple. Combine a ‘high-quality’ typeface with a picture of a ‘cute chick’. Oh yeah, and she’s basically naked and positioned in a variety of provocative poses. All of this is described by the Tumblr’s author, as a ‘useful tool for graphic designers’. Right.\n\nMy initial desire to punch someone in the face was quickly replaced with a quasi-rational thought: Is there a more nuanced relationship between fonts and boobs than this misogynist type nerd’s wet dream?\n\nFonts and boobs. They’re both beautiful. And functional. Both have lustful value beyond their intended purpose. A well-designed type specimen, like a manufactured image of a naked female model’s breasts, is an ideal, an erotic fantasy. The type designer _hopes_ their typeface will be as meticulously treated as it is in the type specimen, replete with OpenType goodies, multiple weights and well-spaced justified alignment. In the hands of a typographic aficionado, the typeface is respected, revered, and handled with love.\n\nMaybe the world does need more type specimens with boobs, real boobs. Here's my contribution: [Fonts & Breastfeeding](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042359/http:/fonts-n-breastfeeding.tumblr.com/). Type is beautiful, functional and worthy of respect. So are breasts.\n\n",
