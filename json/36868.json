  "content": "Hi,\n\ni'm looking for a deco serif similar to the style of Artifex/Kimera Type Foundry.  \n [http://www.kimeratype.com/pdf/specimenArtifex.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414205032/http:/www.kimeratype.com/pdf/specimenArtifex.pdf \"http://www.kimeratype.com/pdf/specimenArtifex.pdf\")  \nArtifex is cool (and maybe would match on a \"fashion\"-project which is in the pipeline), but it is missing lining figures and has only one style (regular), no italics\\*, no thicker weights.  \nCan you suggest me s.th. similar? Keywords: Deco, hybrid, playful, sharp, \"feminine\", but not totally \"over the top\"…\n\n\\*this is not so important\n\n",
