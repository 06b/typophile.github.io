  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am wondering about the possibilities to modify the alias.dat file to match the encoding file I’m using. It seems rather obvious what to do, but it doesnt work.  \nFor example:\n\nIn the encoding file these exists:\n\nO  \no.small  \nhungarumlaut  \nohungarumlaut.small\n\nIn the alias.dat, I added these values:\n\no.small O  \nohungarumlaut.small o.small+hungarumlaut\n\nShouldnt it work? I’ve restarted FontLab 5.02, but not the computer but it does not work as I want to.\n\nIs there something else I need to “adjust”?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n [‹ Adobe OT PS Standard Names (CFF)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505022849/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31406 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [fontlab: kerning doesn't work ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505022849/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31923 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Btw, I got this encoding file from Peter at Fountain for a upcoming font there, so if I’m not wrong – it’s the one you created :) Just wanted to say, it’s a really great encoding file, Filip. It makes things a whole lot easier when building.\n\n"
