Fonts that are part of FB’s Studio library won’t necessarily show up or even be mentioned on their website, but might be available for license to publications (as long as the original commissioning party did not pay for exclusivity or the term has run out).\n\nThink of it as more like haute couture than prêt-à-porter.\n\n— K.\n\n"
