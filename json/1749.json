      "content": "I like it Wanda, but don't forget other printing techniques, like stamping or embossing. Maybe if your wr was smaller it could be so cool blind embossed or heat stamped into a textured paper so the logo was shiny and smooth to contrast with the textured paper. I see alot of cards using black and a PMS ink and after awhile you kind of yawn. I once had a folding card with a diecut on the cover and when you opened it, it listed our agencies services and on the inside i had a list of companies we did work for. Very elegant. Just some ideas, Dan\n\n"
