That works for all types of font formats, as long as the font includes a full character set, that it.   \n   \nOther ligatures are not typically found in the standard character set, which is what makes unicode and opentype so appealing for the user.   \n   \nMany larger, older font families had alternate, or expert fonts that you could buy extra(like Adobe Minion, for instance). This special font had 30 characters or so, many of which were cool ligatures. OpenType allows these to built into standard, single fonts.\n\n"
