Boston.\n\nFont Bureau, Inc. is proud to present two new script families for summer, whether you’re celebrating a friend’s wedding or baseball season:\n\nCASEY - a fat-bottomed script in 3 weights\n\nCasey, Leslie Cabarga’s latest script, recalls “Casey at the Bat,” Ernest Lawrence Thayer’s vivid old baseball poem. Once, fat-bottomed scripts like Casey were everywhere. Today they barely survive as logos for Campbell’s soup, Ford, Coca Cola, and, of course, the Dodgers, yet no recent baseball jersey has been complete without lettering embroidered in this classic form. Cabarga restores the swinging style to current typographic usage; FB 2003–07\n\n[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/casey](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306010452/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/casey \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/casey\")\n\nBISCOTTI - an informal script in 2 weights\n\nBiscotti was commissioned in 2004 by Gretchen Smelter and Donna Adjerian for Brides magazine. “We want a typeface that makes the reader feel pretty; it should capture the voice of this happy occasion.” Cyrus Highsmith has prepared a radically simple descendant of the flourished engraved scripts traditionally deemed suitable for such formal occasions, a 21st century typeface that captures the smiling spirit of these classical forms; FB 2007\n\nBiscotti is available exclusively in OpenType format.\n\n[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/biscotti](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306010452/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/biscotti \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/biscotti\")\n\n==================== NEWS ======================\n\nTYPE 101\n\nFont Bureau founders David Berlow and Roger Black are noted early adopters, sometimes to a punishing extent if a new technology flops. However, after much review, it seems this blog thing has caught on. Welcome to Type 101, Font Bureau’s corner of the web to feature the extracurricular typography discussed, taught, and pondered by our staff. Perhaps we will even offer some sneak previews of upcoming fonts as the blog progresses. Lecture transcripts and views upon the future of screen type legibility have already been archived. Come join the discussion.\n\n[http://type101.fontbureau.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306010452/http:/type101.fontbureau.com/ \"http://type101.fontbureau.com/\")\n\nType 101 RSS feed: feed://type101.fontbureau.com/feed/\n\n——\n\nELMHURST EXPANSION\n\nChristopher Slye’s Elmhurst gains two new styles. Bold Italic and Black Italic were drawn for Rolling Stone and are now available for relicense.\n\n[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Elmhurst/styles](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306010452/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Elmhurst/styles \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Elmhurst/styles\")\n\n——\n\nMORE CUSTOM TYPE UNVEILED\n\nOur Custom section grows with the addition of Vonness, commissioned by Neville Brody for Macromedia.\n\n——\n\nCYRUS HIGHSMITH BACK FROM HOW CONFERENCE\n\nCyrus Highsmith just got back from the HOW conference in Atlanta where he gave his “Thousands of Tiny Drawings” lecture to scores of designers of all stripes. For those of you who could not make it, keep an eye on Type 101 for more of those Tiny Drawings.\n\n================================================\n\nFor more information or to request a press kit, please email [info@fontbureau.com](mailto:info@fontbureau.com) or call Harry Parker or Robb Ogle at 617 423 8770.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nHarry, Samantha & Robb  \n [typesales@fontbureau.com](mailto:typesales@fontbureau.com)  \nThe Font Bureau, Inc.  \n50 Melcher Street, Suite #2  \nBoston, MA 02210\n\n617 423 8770 (voice)  \n617 423 8771 (fax)\n\n[http://www.fontbureau.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306010452/http:/www.fontbureau.com/ \"http://www.fontbureau.com\")\n\n",
