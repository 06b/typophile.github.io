The g is more squiggly than the other characters and that is not required to tell it from the other letters.\n\n2. The top story and bottom story look like they were drawn by different methods.\n\n3. If someone cares about 1 and 2, then they can use the other g.\n\nQuestion: what problem is the double-story g solving?\n\n"
