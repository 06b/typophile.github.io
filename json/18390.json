I suppose it's no different from Mohawk Paper, or Shiite Paper, or Maori Paper, but it seems either completely un-PC, or just flat-out culturally-ignorant to name one's company Inuit Paper. (I'm guessing the company isn't based in Iqaluit.)\n\nAnd it's sad to see the Inuktitut syllabics writing system used by the Inuit - although designed in the 1870s by a kablunak, Edmund Peck - repurposed as the latin alphabet. Maybe I'm a genuine party-pooping stick-in-the-mud, but I find this kind of appropriation of another writing system for kicks and kitsch to be disrespectful. Other examples are provided by FSI, who published [FF Bagel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123141705/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/view_singles_main.ep?id=127652) and [FF Falafel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123141705/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/view_singles_main.ep?id=127654) which are meant to look, respectively, like Hebrew and Arabic scripts. (Nor am I crazy about mock-Gaelic, mock-Cyrillic, or mock-Greek fonts, or any other fonts aping the look of other fonts.)\n\nI'm sure that I'm going to catch a hot pile for saying this, but in my opinion Inuit Paper and its faux-Inuit alphabet isn't clever; it's disrespectful. I'm a fan of Jeremy's, which makes my disappointment doubly keen.\n\n"

I was so appalled by the condescending tone and purple prose - almost certainly nothing to do with Jeremy - that I had to transcribe it:\n\n///\n\nThis is where it all began - the Inuktitut alphabet. These strangely alien shapes and squiggles provided the raw material for our new typeface.\n\nIt's a surprisingly modern collection of characters, as the Inuit people only developed a written language in 1890s, in an effort to preserve their history and identity.\n\nExamples of work in progress - these early sketches by typographer Jeremy Tankard drew heavily on the character and composition of the Inuktitut alphabet.\n\nIdeas and variations were explored before a set of guiding principles for the Inuit typeface emerged.\n\nWhile some letters took their shape directly from the Inuktitut alphabet, others are based on more familiar Roman letterforms.\n\nThis helped create an overall sense of balance, harmony and legibility.\n\nInuit is a highly versatile typeface. It was originally designed as a display font for headlines and big text.\n\nBut, because of the way the traditional and ethnic shapes work together, it's just as legible and engaging in smaller sizes.\n\nUltimately, Inuit's eye-catching appearance is redolent of its origins.\n\nJagged edges counterpoint sleek curves, suggesting the Arctic landscape and indigenous way of life.\n\nSome of the original Inuit shapes seemed a little too extreme, so we developed various alternative characters.\n\nThis means you can always add a bit of variety to your text setting, or choose the version that best suits a particular design.\n\nAlso included are several pairs of letters which flow together - technically known as 'ligatures' - to add texture and rhythm to typeset text.\n\nGenerally fonts only include fl and fi, but Inuit has several more, emphasising its fluency and organic form.\n\n///\n\nThere is plenty of fodder there for my upset. The text is condescending AND inaccurate, which is a heady mix. Any copywriter with an internet connection could have dialed up [this WIKIpedia entry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123141705/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_aboriginal_syllabic_writing) to get some background on the Inutitut Syllabics writing system, which was developed not by Inuit \"to preserve their history and identity\", but by missionaries to spread the word of their god to the animist peoples of the arctic.\n\nIf Arjo Wiggins means to say that their new range of paper is snow-white, they don't need to do so in such a culturally-insensitive and imperialist way. The name is bad enough, and the appropriation of Inuktitut syllabary and its \"strangely alien shapes and squiggles\" is adding insult to injury.\n\n"

Often, additional scripts are just that: additional. They have been designed after the Latin script, and so are beholden to the Latin.

Armenian is conceived of as the \"Caption\" element in the triumvirate.

Furthermore, it's important to realize that the sociocultural reality and needs of users for whose script you're making a font for can be -and usually are- different depending on the script. An Armenian person who might be interested in N&P is quite likely to have different priorities than let's say a Brit who's interested. Different cultures need their fonts to do different things for them. And taking this sort of thing into account is Good Design.\n\nHere's a good overview of the system:  \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/N&Psys.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123141705/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/N&Psys.gif \"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/N&Psys.gif\")\n\n\\> I just wonder whether the users of the system are using it as is intended.\n\nAh, the ever-elusive Intent. :-) You probably know even better than me that the original intent of a type designer is the first thing to go when the font hits the road. Which is OK, really - I'm a pragmatist too, and I simply can't angry over things I can't affect.\n\nThat said, I certainly do have an intent for the thing. But it's also way too early to know if most users will \"get it\", since Nour has only really been used once so far (in Emily Artinian's book that I mentioned in the CR awards thread). One thing that helps though is that for somebody (especially an Armenian person) to go looking for something like this, to find it, and pay good money for it, it's quite likely that the intent will not only get through, but resonate strongly with the customer. N&P isn't something most people would buy just for its looks (it doesn't even look that impressive formally I don't think - although Patria customers have in fact told me that they like its somewhat rigid but sensitive forms - which is actually the intent). This is fortunately exactly what happened with Emily: she looked for 2-3 months, paid the relatively high price pronto, and her tesimonials are the juiciest things a type designer could ever want! :-)\n\n\\> should all be designed to hold together æsthetically.\n\nAgreed. But of course, and as you probably agree, there are other  \nfactors besides aethetics that needs to be balanced in as well.\n\nWhat's encouraging to me is that you seem to think that N&P does  \nin fact enjoy this stylistic cohesiveness. I'm very grateful for  \nthat because that half of the coin is difficult for me to gauge,  \nand the other half (functional authenticity) I already think is  \nworking to satisfaction. So thanks!\n\n\\> I believe that this was the approach in developing the  \n\\> new typefaces for Microsoft’s Longhorn/Vista OS.\n\nAnd this sort of sensitivity is indeed highly welcome, and a recent phenomenon (thankfully gradually overpowering the heady cultural chauvinism of \"70s-style\" non-Latin design). Nonetheless, the one-font-per-script approach is a damaging over-simplification.\n\nNick, the bulk of your questions are in fact addressed fully in my article. Which is not to say you're likely to appreciate the answers! :-) Just FYI though: Spatium #4 is sold out; but Hyphen there's plenty of, and your interest in Greek type might provide extra motivation. Basically, if you're asking these questions because you're interested in the answers (or at least some answers) then my article should help.\n\nBut since the article is not (yet) available publicly,  \nI will try to briefly address some of your points here.\n\n\\> what this typeface system does is offer stylistic alternates of the “other” script.\n\nStyle is exacly what I've tried too look beyond,  \nnot to ignore it certainly, but to balance it in  \na way that users need.\n\n\\> doesn’t offer Armenian typographers as much  \n\\> to work with as their Latin counterparts\n\nCertainly there's room for expansion (there always is). But pointing to the lack of an italic for Nour ignores a basic fact of Armenian typesetting: thanks to our floating emphasis mark, we don't need italics at all the same way that Latin users do. So sure, it would be nice to have (and I don't think it's Latinization) but sort of like smallcaps is to Latin. Before I make italics for Nour, I would make different optical sizes.\n\nAsmik? The inclusion of an italic doesn't make up for its hopelessly Latinized vertical proportions. I know, because that's exactly the type of Armenian fonts I used to make. :-/\n\n\\> Constantia (John Hudson) does a good job of being “doubly bi-lateral”\n\nNo, that's not what it means.\n\n\\> a puzzling inconsistency between scripts: different x-heights.\n\nThat is, of course, exactly a feature, not a bug. Imposing strictly uniform vertical proportions across scripts is nothing short of cultural and functional suicide. The variation of vertical proportions certainly can't go unchecked; but neither should it be shunned. And it is in fact partly for reasons of immersive readability than vertical proportions usually cannot be imposed across scripts.\n\nTake for example Georgian. Would you make its vertical proportions match Latin, even though only 4 out of its 33 letters are confined to the x-height? And if you don't impose vertical proportions in a Georgian/Latin system, where's the threshold? Do you impose it for Armenian/Latin or not? Or what about the big two: Cyrillic (with is extender-starved lc) and Greek? Actually, the determintion of a threshold is moot; the important thing is that a threshold does exist.\n\nIn fact I would suggest (and actually already have) that even within the Latin script different languages ideally need different proportions - at least in terms of the Em space: Polish for example, with its heavy dose of diacritics, is probably better served set at a slightly smaller point size (but with the same line-to-line leading) when set parallel to English text.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Especially in something like Armenian, with its rich extender space (or even Polish, with its rich diacritics) the x-height is certainly the most important, but you can't simply ignore the rest. Even in English the ascenders with their frequency and the descenders with their heft do make a difference. And this is where the notably subtle x-height changes in N&P come from.\n\n\\> although perhaps not in Georgian — but that’s the exception\n\nException? No such thing. It's just a pushier case. Armenian is just like Georgian in that way, simply less extreme. So any anti-Regularity decisions that apply to Georgian also apply -to a lesser extent- to Armenian (and everything else).

So it might be seen as one half of what Hrant advocates: a typeface in which one script is clearly dominant in determining the style and the other subservient to it. The Nyala Latin was designed for the specific purpose of setting some Latin words within Ethiopic text, based on examples of such documents I had examined which typically used e.g. Times or similarly ill-matched design for the Latin. If I were intending to set just a few words of an Ethiopic language in the midst of Latin text, I would not use Nyala for the Latin because I don't think it is an appropriate Latin text face (Gary Munch remarks that it has some merit as a Latin display face independent of the Ethiopic). So it isn't really a bi-matched system in the same way that Ross' Euphemia is, but the Canadian syllabics lend themselves very easily to matching a Latin sans serif.\n\nNyala is something of an unusual approach for me, because the Ethiopic script so obviously has dominance over the Latin. More often, I try to maintain stylistic independence between the two scripts, and address harmony in terms of weight and proportion, aiming for matching typographic colour as far as possible without compromising either script. The reason for this is pragmatic: clients who want to pay for a multiscript typeface don't want to pay for a separate multiscript typeface for each script, as required by Hrant's Nour/Patria system. So I try to treat neither script as stylistically dominant (except, sometimes, where this decision has been taken independently of my design, e.g. 300 years ago by Peter the Great).\n\n"
