  "content": "Hi all,\n\nAbout four months ago, I asked for some help with a [new project](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317052420/http:/www.typophile.com/node/120859). Progress has been slower than I would have liked, but I'm back asking for your thoughts on my initial ideas for the italic version of the same font.\n\nHere's what I have so far.\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/node/120859](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317052420/http:/www.typophile.com/node/120859 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/120859\")\n\nAnd, for the purposes of comparison, here's where I'm at with the original project.\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/91e209e0cb.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317052420/http:/freepdfhosting.com/91e209e0cb.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/91e209e0cb.pdf\")\n\nThe italics share the same core design principles of the original, but are not simply skewed clones. Most letterforms have been redrawn, for example, and the 'pinched' angles are more pronounced.\n\nAll feedback would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\n",

Because italic letters are sloped they are narrower, and the counters consequently smaller, so the interlettering space needs to be too. But looking at the small sizes in a printout now, I'd only tighten them a hair--it's pretty close to good. Overall, though loose and stiff when big, I think this works really well at text sizes.  \nThe /p/ seems to me the most daring character. My eye gets hung up on it a bit, but I'm not sure how to advise you to rein it in. Would it be crazy to keep the bowl and the ascending stem but snip off the little bit on the left side?\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Andreas,\n\nMy aim for the italic is to create a sort of half-brother to the roman, if that makes sense. I want them to appear clearly related but, at the same time, clearly different. This is the reason for the alternate style /p/. In fact, only the /v/, /w/, /x/, /y/ and /z/ are simple skewed versions of their roman counterparts. Every other letter has been redrawn.\n\nI shaved a little more off the /p/ stem, mainly to avoid confusion with the /þ/. The first draft of the caps has been added, but no numerals yet.\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/8c955fc39b.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317052420/http:/freepdfhosting.com/8c955fc39b.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/8c955fc39b.pdf\")\n\n"

I take your point about the /z/; I tried straightening it and also making the kink 'harder', but preferred the original. I may return to it again, but my focus has been on creating a set of italic Greek characters.\n\nHere's the latest version, showing pangrams in various languages, each in italic and then roman for comparison.\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/162b20fa48.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317052420/http:/freepdfhosting.com/162b20fa48.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/162b20fa48.pdf\")\n\nWhilst I've included Latin scripts, I'm most interested in feed back on the Greek at this time.\n\nYou'll notice the Greek italic at the top is not simply a skew, but a redraw, with some characters (alpha, beta, theta, kappa, rho and phi) taking completely different forms. Firstly, any issues with the way the characters are drawn? Secondly, are these different letterforms a bit _too_ 'different' to be standard?\n\nAs always, all thoughts on any aspect is most welcome.\n\nEdit to add: please ignore spacing; I'm focussing primarily on the shapes.\n\n"
