Is the font used in the masthead a custom font or is it available?  \nI know Shepard Fairey uses it on his agency Studio number one site, and he is part founder of Swindle Magazine.\n\nthanks for your help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140604101805im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Swindle_5104.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Well, if this is custom, and it seems likely that it is, it would not be too hard to put this together from pieces of letters, and/or letters with lines drawn through them. Do they use this 'font' for more than the masthead and 'STUDIO NUMBER ONE'? If not, these may be the only letters that exist. (Notice there are two different N's, between the two logos).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
