  "content": "Good day!\n\nI am a designer/technical writer at a software company and am having a difficult time determining whether or not we can develop a documents package that includes Myriad Pro. The end user would receive this typeface a part of our software installation process; I just can't seem to figure out how to find accurate information on this subject. Someone at typophile should be able to tell me!:\n\n**What do I need to do to determine--WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE--the legality of distributing this font?**\n\nPut another way: we are considering incorporating Myriad Pro into an installation that would affect 40,000 (yes, 40k) computers.\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks to you both. I sent my inquiry to Adobe and received just the information I needed in a response from Typekit staff. This definitely put the kibosh on using Myriad Pro for our development effort, hehe (As it turns out, this would have probably gone on 50k+ systems). Here's the email, in the off chance that it may help someone else!\n\n**\"At this time, we don't offer licenses for inclusion in apps. We hope to in the future, but don't have such a program at this time. In the meantime, I recommend that you use the App+ program from FontShop. [www.fontshop.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132951/http:/www.fontshop.com/ \"www.fontshop.com\") They won't be able to offer you Myriad, but they have a nice selection of fonts at reasonable prices.\"**\n\nCheers!\n\n"
