  "content": "Hi,  \ni'm a bit new in font building (second one) and i have a problem. The first one was really simple, one stroke, one fill.  \nI would like to make a 3D font, so i have started with my old one (black stroke, white fill) added the same (stroke/fill black) in background but slighlty shifted down-left and hold filled with triangle. That doesn't work when i copy/paste in fontlab or glyph.\n\nThanks  \nAlex\n\nIllustrator:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809091017im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202013-03-27%20%C3%A0%2013_4411.10.58.png)\n\nglyph paste:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809091017im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202013-03-27%20%C3%A0%2013_5259.12.06.png)\n\nglyph results:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809091017im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202013-03-27%20%C3%A0%2013_6577.12.18.png)\n\n",
