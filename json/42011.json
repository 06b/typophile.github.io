  "content": "Hi folks, I wanted to know what your thoughts are on using Helvetica Rounded for headings, Eurostile Bold for sub headings and Eurostile Standard for body text. Does this sound like a reasonable combination to you? I personally think they are definetly 2 contrasting styles, but any suggestions would be nice!\n\nThanks Craig\n\nEDIT - erm 1st post, just read forum suggestions - so to add this is for a website, my flash portfolio website. Thanks again for any help.\n\n",

I haven't yet used the rounded, but as for normal Helvetica, on screen it tends to jump from it's baseline a little. Unless it's maybe 18pt or above, I'd agree with Haley, and say to use Arial (probably the only time i would advocate it's use).\n\n"

You have to see it.  \nThere are also many ways to \"process\" a type for screen display.\n\nSo \"use Arial/Georgia\" is safe, but I'd say, try your idea and see if it works for your readership on their preferred browsers/OS.\n\n[update]\n\nOK, there is some correlation!  \nLooks fine to me.\n\n"

And is that a pattern in the background? Down goes the legibility another few notches.\n\nFinally, while I am a fan of Flash, it is only for its correct use. Now that sample may not represent the entire site, but there is nothing there that cannot be done better in HTML. If there is no reason to use Flash, don't use it. (And I don't consider things moving around mindlessly to be a reason.) Work hard to achieve your goals with HTML and CSS, and then, only if needed, move to Flash.\n\nReasons not to use Flash include the impossibilty of someone bookmarking a portion of your site, and the probability that your site will be completely ignored by search engines.\n\n"

      "content": "\"What is it about young designers that makes them want to have black/dark backgrounds?\"\n\nOn screen, i find it's almost the opposite of print. the darker the screen, the less light your eyes are bombarded with. This is especially true when it's projected (although a rarer occurrence) A lot of times, flash sites are designed with this in mind. I find using black just as legible in this case, maybe not the pattern.\n\nAs to the Helvetica rounded, it seems to be okay on-screen in this instance, although its not my favorite typeface, it doesn't appear to be doing anything visually weird. I would definitely get rid of the euorstile\n\n"

I can't really do anything about it as I am located near a strong radio interference source, and any monitor would be doing the same thing here, and moving is impractical. Oddly enough, orange text on a dark gray background suppresses the appearance of these distortions.\n\nBut that's just my special case. In general, if you _must_ use reversed out text, it's a good idea so step up the weight a notch, i.e.: change your text weight from Regular to Medium and Bold to Heavy (if you're using the [URW++ version of Eurostile](http://web.archive.org/web/20121128032927/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile/)).\n\n"

I've tried to keep it nice, simple and intuitive.\n\n"
