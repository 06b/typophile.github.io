  "content": "Hi, I’m new here and i’ve got a problem I hope you can help me with.  \nI’m running Indesign CS2 on my mac and were using Smartconnection to communicate our layouts with our clients.  \nRecently the font Unit is giving us some headache.  \nWe’re using linotype fontexplorer X for fontmanagement.  \nI’ve been using Unit for this specific client in this configuration for quite some time now. This morning when opening a file in it’s final stage of development Unit regular was reported missing while it was active in Fontexplorer.  \nSo I cleaned out fontexplorer completely and removed al trace of the fonts on my local disc. Then I restart the machine and copied the fonts from the server and installed the fonts into fontexplorer again. This time Unit medium, bold and black didn’t show.  \nDid the thing a few times and every time different styles of Unit went missing.\n\nPlease help Deadline is closing in and we need every workstation available to complete this issue.\n\nThanks, Steven\n\n [‹ Implementing contextual mark positioning](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203203828/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41658 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [How do I break text threading across Indesign frames ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203203828/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41775 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Or do it by hand (instructions can be Googled I guess).\n\nBTW To make sure that the problem lies in this area you could try this: define a new user account and log in to that. Test the behaviour of ID and the problematic font(s). If everything is ok you could either troubleshoot the userlibrary in the original account or migrate everything that you need over to the new one and delete the old one.\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

This only works if you are working solely with InDesign or Adobe products\n\n"
