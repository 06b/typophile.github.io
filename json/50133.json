  "content": "Here's a weird problem (of many weird problems since moving over to windows vista). I've set up an ornament feature in my latest script font. It works fine on a Windows XP machine with Illustrator CS but on a Windows Vista machine using Illustrator CS2 here is what happens.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019105043im_/http:/typophile.com/files/orna_4416.jpg)\n\nas you can see from the picture, when the first sequence is typed out (from the glyph menu in illustrator) what I get is not what I typed. The last ornament turns into the next ornament typed. This is a very basic and simple ornm feature:\n\nfeature ornm {  \n sub bullet from @ornaments;  \n} ornm;\n\n@ornaments = [orn.01 orn.02 orn.03 orn.07 orn.05 orn.06 orn.04 orn.08 orn.09 orn.10 orn.11 orn.12 orn.13 orn.14 orn.15];\n\nfeature ornm; is also placed in the aalt feature at the very bottom.\n\nIs this a bug in Vista? Illustrator CS2? or the two combined? Would updating Illustrator help? Anyone have similar problems when testing OT fonts in Vista?\n\n",
