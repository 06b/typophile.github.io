You'd have to fabricate the elaborate **F** and **Y** and the numerals, unless you can find matches in other fonts.\n\n"

      "content": "This is a wonderful reminder of an era when architects, at least in Paris, had the pride to sign their buildings. One of the things I remember fondly from walks in streets in the XVI arrondisment is buildings of the pre WWI era with these inscriptions. No two were identical. As for the inscription, this is lettering not a font. The capital F is a nice Tuscan style. Something similar to it is found in [Frisco Antique Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019065014/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/frisco-antique-display-sg/), although the font lacks the art nouveau flowing lines of the inscription.  \nDon\n\n"
