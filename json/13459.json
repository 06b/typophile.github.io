Add hundreds of authors, and it should not be a problem, right? Right?\n\nWell, we want to offer an incentive. The top five (5) wiki authors will receive our new Typophile t-shirt, originally designed by [Christopher Simmons](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014052858/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Christopher%20Simmons). The rest of you will be able to get this tee with your membership(s).\n\nImportant Note! Make your entries QUALITY. Creating a swarm of one-line entries will only work AGAINST you. While all input is welcome, only entries with at least **20 words** will be factored toward a position in the top 5.\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014052858im_/http:/typophile.com/content/images/new_tee.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "OK, about the “access denied” thing, this is what I have figured out so far. It appears that the Wiki is making up incorrect addresses for some of the links, and the addresses are case sensitive. For example, when you click on the “Indices” link, it uses this address - [http://typophile.com/wiki/indices](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014052858/http:/typophile.com/wiki/indices \"http://typophile.com/wiki/indices\"). But it should be this - [http://typophile.com/wiki/Indices](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014052858/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Indices \"http://typophile.com/wiki/Indices\"). The difference is the cap “I” on “Indices” in the address.\n\nAnother example: This link to Blackletter - [http://typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014052858/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter \"http://typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter\"), should have a lower case “b”. So there doesen’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to the link names case.\n\nI have also found this kind of link - [http://typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014052858/http:/typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif \"http://typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif\"), which dosen’t work. the “%20” part of that address represents a “space”, so that is OK. But if I change the first “s” to a “S” then it works. Hmmm.\n\nI have also found this oddity. In a Wiki link to a string like ” Barnhart Brothers & Spindler”, it will truncate it to “Barnhart Brothers”, ignoring everthing after the “&”... sometimes... not all the time.\n\nI think I understand the -Title Link|Title Displayed- syntax, but I don’t think everyone gets this. Not everyone is going to type -American Type Founders|ATM-. And since there is not a real search yet, it is sometimes hard to tell if a Wiki link does not have an entry or if it is not linking properlly to an existing entry. I guess we just have to police this as best we can to try to avoid multiple entrys.\n\n"
