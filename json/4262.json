      "content": "I flipped all the way through the serifed type families in the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" and didn't spot this face. There were a number of Czech type designers, such as Menhardt, Ruzicka, Kapr and Preissig, but nothing showed a style as distinctive as this.   \n   \nThis raises an issue that has bugged me for a long time. At least in the U.S., other than Jaspert's excellent book, there is very little that shows European typefaces that have not become digital fonts. We see a fair amount about English type, predictably, but almost nothing about Continental European metal typefaces.   \n   \nDoes anyone know of any good references for that subject? Odds are they won't be in English, but type speaks for itself. This may be a question for Luc Devroye.\n\n"

But these specimens are rarely to be find in the antique book stores. And if I find one, it is very expensive. But this typeface isn't listed in my specimens.   \n   \nYou can try [http://www.symposionbooks.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124555/http:/www.symposionbooks.com/), they offer several type specimens of Czech printers. The store could send you the book abroad.\n\n"

I see two books that say 'Type Specimens' but that's all I can understand when the description isn't English (a few are).   \n   \nMaybe if you have time, we can write by e-mail, and you can explain a few of them to me. Today is not a good time for me though. Thank you.\n\n"
