Anywhere. It's listed on myFonts, but as no longer available. Poking around Berthold's site, it's not there at all. All references to it that I can find on the web point to myFonts.\n\nIt's not a new font (1974), so I can't imagine any copyright issues that would explain it's disappearance.\n\nAnyone know the story?\n\n",
