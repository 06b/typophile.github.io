And when change the text, it's size or style the space around the black selection does not change/update. Very annoying. What could be wrong?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203105014im_/http:/typophile.com/files/error_4719.jpg)\n\nThanks,  \nClaus\n\n",

I'm assuming that you're generating the PFA file from FontLab Studio (v5.0.4), yes?\n\nWhen the font's UPM value is different from 1000, FontLab Studio generates the PFA file with incorrect FontBBox values. The FontBBox values are correctly displayed in the \"Key dimensions\" pane of the Font Info dialog; but the values in the generated font will be different.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203105014im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PFA_FBBox_3442.png)\n\nFor quick workaround, just open the PFA file in a text editor and edit the FontBBox values to match what's displayed by the Font Info.\n\nBTW, CompareFamily quickly pointed me to the reason of the problem. **Single Face Test 15** (Warn if Font BBox x/y coordinates are improbable, or differ between head table and CFF) output the following message:  \n**The font bounding box in the hhea table '(-322, -512, 2306, 1798)' differs from that in the CFF table '[-157, -250, 1126, 878]'.**\n\n"

The only thing is that the selection still looks like before â€“ that is only colouring from the x-height and down to somewhere below the baseline. This is a minor issue, so let's not waste time on pursuing that.\n\nClaus\n\n"
