  "content": "Dear Typophile,\n\nI have never posted here before and offer this thread to you as a plea for help. I admire the level of expertise visible on this board.\n\nI am working on a personal logo and, although I have gotten it where I am suitably happy, areas of the script and swashes I have drawn feel clearly off for reasons I do not have the capacity to articulate. It is posted below in the hopes that I can be guided in the general direction to resolve this (as it is totally bugging the hell out of me).\n\nBelow is an image and attached is a PDF, for anyone who cares to look at it. Thanks!\n\nAny comments on the logo generally are completely welcome, it’s for my own portfolio / business cards etc.\n\nYours forever,  \nNelson\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202063806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/omb_logo_5383.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [omb\\_logo.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202063806/http:/typophile.com/files/omb_logo_0.pdf) | 202.13 KB |\n\n [‹ Job Agency Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202063806/http:/typophile.com/node/49436 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Alex Parrott ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202063806/http:/typophile.com/node/50116 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I know that it is an “e” in context the word it is used in, however it looks more like an “o” than an “e.” That said, the logo is very well done.\n\n———————————-  \nMichael Browers  \n [www.michaelbrowers.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202063806/http:/www.michaelbrowers.com/ \"www.michaelbrowers.com\")\n\n"

It’s almost spot on but there’s just something small that bothers me a bit. Or is it the lower swoosh that’s a positioned badly? Not sure. Try this: try flip the graphic horizontally so you’re “looking at it in the mirror” and see if it still holds together well. You might find this technique reveals to you some useful hint on how to finish it off perfectly.\n\nLooks like a whiskey or old fashioned beer label. nice.\n\n"

Right now it raises and underscores “The,” neither of which is necessary.\n\nI’m getting a bit of “Jhe” instead of “The.”\n\nMaybe a hair more space between One and Man - unless you intended an interCaps look.\n\nKerning in BRAND - BR is too close, maybe a bit too much space around the A, too.\n\nThis is very appealing.\n\n"

Many logos lack that.\n\nAbout eliason’s comment of seeing Jhe, I wonder if this might be a solution:  \nLook at the top “serif” of the J, see how it points to the right. What would happen if you slightly had it extend to the left? I’m not a type expert so it’s just a guess, but could work.\n\nPity CocaCola doesn’t have a T in it because that would be your answer!\n\n"

So it’s still not touching the cross bar of the t but is close to kissing it? Also I tend to want to nudge the underscore a tiny bit to the left, just a tiny bit.\n\n"

I get so caught up in microscopic changes I have a tendency to ignore the bigger relationships.\n\nI think there is some truth to the claim that the first is more appealing, in my efforts to stabilize it I have effectively neutralized some of the embellishment and indeed verticality I initially had. I am working on a medium between the two, using a more restrained stem for the capital T.\n\nAgain, thanks for all the help.\n\n"

      "content": "No one else has mentioned this so perhaps it’s only me, but I think there are kerning problems with the words “ONE MAN”. Specifically, the spacing on both sides of the A is more open than the rest of the line. There are three possible ways to fix (or at least improve on this):\n\n1) Tighten up the spacing on each side of the A. To make the spacing exactly visually equal it would probably be necessary to let the bottom serifs of MAN touch each other, which you may or may not like depending on your personal preferences.\n\n2) Open up the spacing of the rest of the line to match the spacing around the A. Again, you may or may not like this option.\n\n3) The third option would be to fudge between the two previous options: Close up the spaces on each side of the A until the lower serifs are almost, but not quite touching. Then open up the spacing of the rest of the line a little — again not quite enough to exactly match the visual spacing around the A. The result will be a line that, although not exactly spaced equally, is close to equal without resorting to the extremes of the first two options.\n\n"

It looks to me like those two letters are leaning forward while the “e” is almost upright if not leaning back.\n\nI’m not saying to pull back the angle of the “T” & “h”. I think its best to match their “oblique-ness” with your “e”.\n\nBesides that the symbol/script quality of “The” compliments your main type choice well. I enjoy the extra space in “brand” and the tightness of “One Man”. Though maybe those 2 words need a hair more space between them (sorry to nit pick).\n\nGood job.\n\n"

All the criticism of the letter “E” (either it is leaning to the wrong side, hurting legibility, or looks like an “o”) led me to the realization that it kind of looks like a flat tire. I redrew it as more of an italic than a script.\n\nStill needs work on integration with the rest of the word.\n\nIt may seem like I am extending this project out to levels of preposterous detail, but I am only doing so because I am learning so much throughout the process.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202063806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/omb_the_compare_5952.gif)\n\n"
