I've been looking for the font of both \"Structura\" and the information below. Have tried Identifont and WhatTheFont, but no luck.\n\nThe font above looks very much like Pritchard or URW Oklahoma or Adobe ITC Anna, but differs slightly, especially the \"R\".\n\nHelp would be, ofcourse, greatly appreciated.  \nKind regards,  \nTom Swinnen\n\n",
