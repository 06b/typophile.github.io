Start here:  \n [http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.31.italic.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824111148/http:/briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.31.italic.htm \"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.31.italic.htm\")\n\nand note also the three sub-links in this section. His bit on curves is great.\n\nI've already started writing up some of my own observations on italics and obliques, stemming from my work on Hypatia Sans italics. Mostly aimed at the practical issues of making modified obliques or italics from an upright face. Might be helpful to somebody out there, I hope.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Is Hypatia Sans italics available yet? I'm currently using the font family offered with CS3 and it rocks. Let me know when and where I can get my hands on the italics. Thanks\n\n"
