Maybe they just look so much cooler, because they are in chrome and not in black and white? ;-)\n\nWhen it comes to those script-like car logos, it makes a big difference to make ONE word look good or to make a typeface, because of the problem of all the letter ligatures. I am just in the process of making a font inspired by car logos, and I can tell you it's not easy. Without the relatively new OpenType technology it would be impossible at all. So I learned pretty quick, why there are not much fonts in this style.\n\nRalf\n\n"

With a font you might have to change the shape of one letter to provide visual consistency with others.\n\nBasically, there is a big difference between creating a logo and creating a font.\n\n"

Last year they switched their body copy to a font that is sold in England, and well, I couldn't see spending the money they were asking. (I've put it in Eurostile, and Y&R have been okay with the results -- because we are getting paid.)\n\nMany of the cars have fonts that look original, but they have been modified to get the \"logo type look.\"\n\nIt remind me of publishing -- during the days when every titled was handlettered.
