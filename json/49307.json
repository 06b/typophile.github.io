      "content": "James, I recently did a project with MS specifying a glyph set for a pan-African UI font (much of the work based on research I originally did for them in 1998). I've got reasonably good data for about 200 African languages (mostly in paper form); from this research and from discussions on software Africanisation forums I've long since come to the conclusion that trying to target specific language coverage is a bad idea unless the number of languages is small. OpenType GPOS mark positioning makes it relatively easy to target the majority of African languages without needing to compile data about individual languages, which is difficult to come by.\n\nNote that some diacritic letters needed for African alphabets are not individually encoded in Unicode: they rely on combining mark characters. These can be handled using GSUB in the ccmp feature, but it is much more flexible to handle them with GPOS mark positioning.\n\nI gave a presentation on Latin glyphs for African fonts as part of a workshop with MS and Diane Collier at TypeCon in Buffalo (other presentations dealt with indigenous African writing systems). I've uploaded my slides to\n\n[http://www.tiro.com/John/African%20Presentation.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017220718/http:/www.tiro.com/John/African%20Presentation.pdf \"http://www.tiro.com/John/African%20Presentation.pdf\")\n\nI don't know how useful they are without commentary, but feel free to contact me if you have questions.\n\n"

      "content": "I think some of the orthographies are still in flux. I remember back in the early 1990s when a book designer needed some Pan-Nigerian characters. Zapf had made a font for Pan Nigerian, but the designer want to use something different.\n\nSomebody with some official connections got involved in all this, and I was told that when a unified Pan Nigerian character set was first proposed, some people wanted a dot under characters (e,i,o, & s, I believe); others wanted a bar below. A compromise was reached, whereby a bar with rounded corners was used -- it could also be thought of as an extended dot. Anyway, I made the characters up with that mark.\n\nLast year we set a book which had some Pan Nigerian, and at first, the author wanted those old marks, but in proof changed to wanting the dots, as shown at\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Nigerian\\_Alphabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017220718/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Nigerian_Alphabet \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Nigerian\\_Alphabet\")\n\nFWIW\n\n"

I noticed that from the Wiki page on the African Reference Alphabet, there are two letters each with the same Icelandic capital form, but with different minuscules. In the table you have, there are two different capital forms. Is this from lack of distinction in modern fonts, or that no one language uses both letters so no need to distinguish, or lack of support by the language users?\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

      "content": "The Niamey African Reference Alphabet has a number of problems, and so far as I can tell it was never widely adopted. In particular, I've not seen the lowercase eth form used in any African texts, so I think this introduction -- and the innovative uppercase form to distinguish it from the barred D -- was a non-starter. The display in the chart on the Wikipedia page shows a Croatian-style barred lowercase d instead of an eth as in the original Niamey document, adding to the confusion. In all the African orthographies I researched, the Ɖ was the uppercase of ɖ.\n\nIf you look at [Don Osborne's page on the Niamey alphabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017220718/http:/www.bisharat.net/Documents/Niamey78annex.htm), you'll see that the French language version of the report did not show any uppercase letters. One of the books I consulted in my research in 1998 was _A thesaurus of African languages_ by Mann and Dalby, the (English language) text of which is set in all lowercase letters. It presents a revised African Reference Alphabet that incorporates new letters proposed by the authors, including the inverted v as an a vowel variant.\n\n"
