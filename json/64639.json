Search for the phrase \" [DEWAG](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018061209/http:/images.google.ch/images?hl=de&um=1&q=DEWAG+-GmbH+-KG+-AG&sa=N&start=20&ndsp=20)\" on google & co., this was the name of the \"creative\" department/organisation in the GDR. I think were was nothing that we should call \"corporate design\" in the GDR. This thin folder for the 750 Berlin anniversary is a very late sample of a major national advertising project and can't be used as representative for design in the GDR at all.\n\nBTW. I don't know of many samples for the usage of Maxima in ordinary live.\n\n-- [astype.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018061209/http:/www.astype.de/)--\n\n"
