  "content": "Hi, I want to purchase a font from myfonts.com for a client. I think that they generally sell licenses that allow a font to be used on 5 computers.\n\nMy client should be able to use the font on a limited number of machines as well as I on one machine. Can I buy a license over my myfonts.com account, so that the client can use it on 4 machines and I can use it on mine, or do I have to buy 2 licenses, which seems a bit of a waste of money to me.\n\nIf I didn’t use the font, could I still buy a license for my client? Or should they buy it themselves?\n\nMany thanks for answers.\n\n",

Technically, you are one user (locations) and your client another.\n\nYou can buy a license for your client, but for the sake of keeping an ordered paper trail, I would suggest your client licenses it themselves.\n\n"

      "content": "i know some eulas dont allow this, but - given its allowed by the eula - you could buy one license, design the whole stuff, delete the fontfiles from your computer (including backups) and then the client could install the font - right?\n\nof course problems will come up if you have to design something for them again, and they have to delete all the fonts on their computer, give you the license, you do it, and the whole thing starts again… but i work for many startups and getting them to pay for ANY font is hard - this could help (“lets just take arial”, erm).\n\n"

      "content": "Transferring is allowed by some EULAs. So, technically, yes, you could do the work and when you are finished transfer the rights of use to your client. Because I’m paranoid I would always call the foundry before licensing and let them know what I’m planning to do. Let them answer that it is ok. Cover all bets so to speak. Then when you are going to transfer the fonts, get back in touch with the foundry again and ask them how they require you to do it.\n\n"
