The last one has gotten way too busy. You should be able to say what you are wanting to say with out adding all the little drawings. It may have gotten much to bold too.

It said that 'the meaning of an image do not express their designers ideas. The designer's message serves the expressed needs of the client who is paying for it'. In your case, you are the client. Ok, here is what I'm going to do if I'm in your position, I know it's a bit hard playing as designer who own the firm. But first, I can't find the right or perfect logo if I don't have the main idea of what kind a firm I'm leading for. It's going to change and change every time I find a bunch of idea for the logo. So I think it is important to find the perfect idea before the excecution phase.   \n   \n+ep+\n\n"
