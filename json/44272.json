  "content": "I'm trying to make use of FontLab's ability to run a Python script when a font is opened, the open.py that's located in the \"System\" Macros folder but I'm unable to get things working.\n\nAs a test, in the \"System\" Macros folder I have an open.py that contains:  \n`print 'font opened'`\n\n...and a save.py that contains  \n`print 'font saved'`\n\n...but only the save.py is working. I've tried opening fonts from the file menu and by double clicking a VFB but I get nothing. Is there something else I need to do? I've tried this on two computers, with both FontLab 5.0.2 and 5.0.4 for the Mac.\n\nThanks!  \nAndy\n\n",
