      "content": "TTF hints won’t work for OTF. They are completely different outline formats.\n\nTTF uses TrueType quadratic Bézier curves, OTF (also known as CFF for Compact Font Format) uses PostScript cubic Bézier curves. They are related, but not the same, so the hints are not compatible or transferable.\n\nThat said, you can autohint an OTF font using the autohint tool that comes with the AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType) or the autohint command in FontLab. (You can also run the Adobe autohinter from within FontLab using a script that comes with the AFDKO.) The results won’t be the same as a hinted TTF font because the format and the way hinting works is different.\n\n"

The OpenType format is actually a _unification_ of Microsoft/Apple's TrueType, and Adobe's Type 1 (CFF) format. The file header indicates what sort of outlines the font contains - it can be either one.\n\nWith that in mind, \"OTF without hinting, and TTF for web\" makes no sense without specifying what kind of OTF it is.\n\n"

So Mark’s comment just reflects what people understand when these terms and abbreviations are used. Also note that Mark actually said “OTF” (referring to the file suffix) — it was you who then talked about “OpenType format”. Those things belong together, but there effectively not the same thing.\n\n<cite>A client asked me if I could send the OTF , with the TTF hinting for web.</cite>\n\nI would ask them what he is trying to achieve. I am pretty sure he is himself confused about those technical details and therefore makes this rather strange request.\n\n"

      "content": "No, for several reasons.\n\nFirst, I don't think \"most\" printers use PostScript natively. There is a thick layer of driver software between the font file and the printer.\n\nSecond: font formats may be changed by the OS, by user-end software, or by printer drivers to suit the destination device.\n\nThird: native support for TrueType fonts has actually been added to PostScript, years ago :P\n\nFor everyday practical purposes there really is no difference between TrueType and PostScript flavour fonts -- especially when both are wrapped inside an OTF. A designer may have a preference (me, I can't wrap my head around quadratic curves) and some older tools such as MS Volt work on a TTF format only -- but even that can be worked around.\n\n"

But the results depend on your setting on the font and character level.\n\n<cite>But OTF PostScript curves are better for printing …</cite>\n\nI wouldn’t know why. There were a RIPs in the early 1990s which couldn’t handle TrueType, but that was a long time ago.  \nThe only argument against TrueType outlines is that the designer has probably done the design in PostScript and the automatic conversion could lead to outlines which are not identical to the original. But that isn’t even a limitation of TrueType, but only a problem of the conversion process.\n\n"

It’s the PS-OTs which regularly cause trouble outside of the DTP apps, e.g. font embedding in office apps, not printing or wrong glyph scaling in recent versions of Mac OS X.  \nTTF is still the standard format for companies such as Apple and Microsoft and it’s much better tested in software of these companies than PS-OTs.\n\n"
