  "content": "I have a friend that arbitrarily uses extended and condensed fonts all the time.\n\nWhat is the difference between condensed and compressed? Are there rules to when and where to use these versions of a font? I don't believe I've ever had the inclination to use these versions, but when I see my friend's work I know it's out of place. I can't really make a good argument for or against his use of these styles.\n\nCan someone enlighten me?\n\n",

      "content": "Every face is different, but I've used helve condensed for setting warnings and other dense info on the back of packages. In this case condensed is still legible. Compressed usually means you've got some extra weight as well and probably need to use this for display work. So maybe you could generalize that condensed should be legible at smaller sizes, but not compressed.\n\n"

And Extended and Compressed fonts are capable of being used as display fonts at much larger sizes?\n\nWhat would make me want to choose an extended or compressed style over a standard one? Would it only be based on size limitations, like a newspaper column then? Is that why extended and compressed fonts were designed, for justified copy?\n\n"

Apparently stars will have the typeface their names must appear on the credits and billing materials specified, but only for height. Result, letters 72 points high and 3 points wide (I exaggerate, but not much).\n\n"

      "content": "I don't think you can make grand generalizations, but condensed fonts almost all look like a compromise to me. There are times when they are handy though, like setting in a narrow column or on the front of a can or other cylindrical object. I usually look for a face that is somewhat narrow to start with, rather than using a condensed version. Compressed versions will often close up at smaller sizes. But then I'm just a regular freelance designer as well.\n\n"

To name one grand master of designing compressed and condensed fonts. Christian Schwartz, Jonathan Hoefler, Tobias Frere-Jones, and Cyrus Highsmith. Just a short list of people who have designed companion widths for their fonts.\n\nGood point about compressed being good for display. I've used compressed in display and then condensed for smaller text before and I find that to work well if I want to maintain some sort of continuity of style.\n\n"

      "content": "I find that the relative character proportions of the normal need to be modified for the other scalings. So characters that are relatively narrow in the normal need to be widened, relatively, in the extended, because one doesn't want narrow-looking characters in an extended style. And vice versa for the condensed.\n\nYou can see this principal in Futura:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141116092649im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CE_6697.jpg)\n\nSo in general, condensed and extended styles have a greater homogeneity of glyph width than the normal proportion of type.\n\nWith the popularity of semi-condensed sans faces, we're seeing more typography with even-width letterforms.\n\n"

The classic example is the headline that was being left open for a one-column story in a newspaper, on the result of a motor race. The winner was \"Rickenbacker in a Duesenburg\" (or something like like that), hence the need for ultra-squished fonts.\n\n"

They save space and can be really eyecatching, especially those quirky old condensed gothic and grotesque designs. Condensed type can also be a lifeline when designing for writers who simply do not understand concepts like brevity or understatement. For example, Today I used Pill Gothic 300mg to deal with a postcard and a half-page magazine ad that could not contain the text in the 600mg width.\n\n"
