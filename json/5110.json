  "content": "I would appreciate any help locating the font used in the weber logo. It can be found in the upper left corner on [www.weber.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321005252/http:/www.weber.com/). I have searched relentlessly and have had no success, I have found similiarities in the font Modula Regular. The spurs are somewhat similiar but the e is a little different.   \n   \nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n",

      "content": "This is almost definetely a custom designed logo which may have started life as something like [compacta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321005252/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/compacta/ef-light/testdrive.html?s=weber&p=72) or swiss 911 with modifications to the w and b. You may also want to check out [aurora condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321005252/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aurora/condensed/testdrive.html?s=weber&p=72) for something similar. Or they may simply have drawn it from scratch. Either way, I think they've modified their earlier logo and simply added little serifs.   \n   \nHere's their original and modified logos. These larger images may also help someone else suggest something. I hope this helps ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321005252im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321005252im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37669.jpg) ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321005252im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37670.jpg)\n\n"
