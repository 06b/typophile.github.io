Imagine the stability and speed of Quark with the wonderful (hehe) blurry dropshadow of InDesign! ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419225955im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nSeriously, InDesign is beginning to compete with Quark on a more serious basis now, it's faster than before and I really like the workflow. To bad my printshop hates it.   \n   \nAs for opentype, it's indeed a promising format, but as I find the current slots available in a typeface hard to fill up, opentype will not exactly give me less work ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419225955im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Joe, you've asked some really key questions. I think that an argument could be made that until Quark supports OpenType features, you won't see widespread adoption -- at least, not in the publishing industry.   \n   \nPublishers are pretty much wedded to Quark. InDesign has some attractive features, but nothing compelling enough to overcome the inertia. Converting even a small shop over to InDesign is a serious proposition and investment, let alone a large established design department.   \n   \nThat said, Quark may have some serious challenges if it doesn't get carbonized soon. As OS X stabilizes and gets more established, the fact that Indy runs native may become compelling enough for some operations to make the switch, especially if Adobe offers cross-grade pricing comparable to a Quark upgrade.   \n   \nIf Indy makes inroads, then OpenType will make inroads, and Adobe's gamble will have paid off. Until then, it looks like a crap shoot to me.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

      "content": "Stuart, good question. I'm not all that OpenType aware myself yet. ;-) But I think there are two levels of OT awareness. I think you're right, the first -- just being able to use OT fonts -- is accomplished by the very nature of OS X. In earlier OSes, it can be accomplished with the latest versions of ATM.   \n   \nBut I think the second, more interesting level of OT awareness -- accessing the typographic features: automatic ligatures, optical versions, auto true small caps, etc. -- requires that the application be written to utilize these features. Maybe that's just Carbon apps, though. It may be that the OS X font panel, which I think is used by all Cocoa apps, includes access to all OT features. I'm not sure.   \n   \nBut Quark going straight to Cocoa? -- yeah, right. I'm not holding my breath.   \n   \nToo bad you won't be able to come to TypeCon this year. I think that Tom Phinney is giving a presentation on OT that should prove quite enlightening.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

A part of   \nthis equation is that once a face is in OT format,   \nseperate cross platform development is no longer   \nan issue.   \n   \nYou can see how these go hand in hand. If type   \nfoundries/resellers are pushing the benefits of   \nOpenType and making the fonts available, the   \nadoption will potentially move faster.   \n   \nYou can see how Adobe is pushing the technology   \nin this way, having already ported their   \nentire font library to OT.

      "content": "The biggest barrier to widespread adoption of InDesign is not any real advantages Quark might have. It's all the scaffolding put in place over the last decade to make Quark work. I would encourage anyone with a newer machine (e.g. capable of running OS 10.2 and with at least 512MB of RAM) to grab one copy of InDesign (buy it with the Adobe Design Collection for your next new machine) and start doing one-machine projects on it, and see how fast it sells itself.   \n   \nQuark adopting OpenType? Ha, Quark can't even handle freakin' UNICODE. Not even in their hyper-expensive Passport version. ID does multilingual typesetting out of the box, but Quark can't even make use of the simple CE characters already found in every Microsoft TT and Apple AAT font.   \n   \nDo ease into ID slowly, but do prepare to abandon the Quark ship eventually. They're continuously dismissive of any questions regarding intelligent fonts.   \n   \n(nota bene: I have a financial interest in OpenType font sales.)\n\n"

Plus, the font files are cross-platform.   \n   \nDown side: Apps that don't go out of their way to do so don't get the cool typographic features. Apps that don't know Unicode will still only be able to access platform-specific encodings and generally be hobbles as much as they have always been.   \n   \nSideways side: Although it's nice to make an OpenType font in that you've got one font file for both platforms, that really only simplifies sales (single downloadable instead of two). At Adobe we've found that due to platform-specific issues, we still have to test on both platforms just as extensively as before. Although, we do have better automated testing utilities now (such as CompareFamily, part of the OpenType FDK from Adobe).   \n   \nI'm doing some pretty in-depth stuff on OpenType library conversion at ATypI this year. The techie stuff (the \"how\") is in the Font Technology Forum, and a more general presentation (the \"what\") in the main conference.   \n   \nT\n\n"

Sure, I won't have access to the cool typographic features like auto ligatures, swashes, and stuff; but my fear is that since the SC, for instance, is bundled in to the OT font and is accessed through OT style swapping, I won't be able to actually access it through the font menu as before.

I suspect Quark's codebase makes some pretty deep-rooted assumptions about text handling, and they don't expose nearly as much of the app to plug-in developers as InDesign does, yet doing this in InDesign proved to be quite a bit of work. In all likelihood, Quark will need to make some underlying architectural changes first.   \n   \nIf it were feasible, then Adobe probably still wouldn't do it. I mean, why would we put immense work into making our competitor's product better? If we were going to make a plug-in, we'd sooner do something that would help an Adobe product.
