That particular nameplate actually dates from the very early 1900s and was used for decades.\n\nAmerican Type Founders did release a typeface called Curtis Post in 1902. It was based on Post Oldstyle Roman No. 2, which was the model for hand-lettered headings in the magazine at the time:  \n [http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-71374.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317155353/http:/luc.devroye.org/fonts-71374.html \"http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-71374.html\")  \n [http://luc.devroye.org/EJKitson-or-GuernseyMoore-or-HermannIhlenburg--Po...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317155353/http:/luc.devroye.org/EJKitson-or-GuernseyMoore-or-HermannIhlenburg--PostOldstyleRomanNo2--1901.png \"http://luc.devroye.org/EJKitson-or-GuernseyMoore-or-HermannIhlenburg--PostOldstyleRomanNo2--1901.png\")\n\nThere are a few digital “tribute” typefaces:  \n [https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317155353/https:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/ \"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/\")  \n [https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/lamp-post/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317155353/https:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/lamp-post/ \"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/lamp-post/\")\n\nAnother typeface from that era that is very similar is Windsor:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/windsor-mt/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317155353/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/windsor-mt/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/windsor-mt/\")\n\n"
