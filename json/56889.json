      "content": "Great question :)\n\nI guess no one ever get to question this, cos smileys aren't really used in what you might call formal texts, so book typographers are probably never confronted with this question. And I wonder how many people design their emails and blog posts (If you'll find them anywhere, it's probably here...) Anyway, as smileys are made of punctuation, it's unavoidable that there are some conflicts there. I just try to integrate them somehow (like this :) ) Just try to have fun with it and make up your own rules, cos there is no rulebook yet (though there might be one someday, image that: A corporate identity manual regarding the use of smileys in documents) LOL\n\n=:~P\n\ncheerio Queneau\n\n"
