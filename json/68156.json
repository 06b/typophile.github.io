  "content": "Another in my series of eccentric White Center (Seattle) signs made by merchants whose first language most likely isn't English. This made me laugh.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150108113800im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sig-nails_4728.JPG)\n  \nFunny how the first 4 letters in NAILS (left sign) are razor-sharp, but the writer went free-form with the S after presumably giving up on a ruler-based letter. \n\nThe rest of the text is wildly mixed cases, sizes and spacing.\n\nThen the artist added hand-drawn palm trees, flower and butterfly to complete its beauty and fill in the disturbing white spaces. Maybe his wife told him it wasn't pretty enough to appeal to women customers.\n\nObviously the sign on the right was composed by a different designer, who used an actual font (of questionable suitability), margins, a border and illustration, again with an eccentric result.\n\nthe two signs together - well how could any passer-by in need of nail attention resist?\n\n",

Which haven't been up-dated since 1972.  \nThat would explain why I've seen that blue and pink sign so many times before.\n\nThe decoration on the hand-made sign is kind of out of the \"white space must die\" school of art.\n\nThere's a shop near where my office used to be called, \"Good Hair Day Salon\". I'll always got a kick out of the name.\n\n"

Where would the artist have even seen such a typographical oddity?\n\nI guess I shouldn't waste any more time trying to make sense of it.\n\n"
