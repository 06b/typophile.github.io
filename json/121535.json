It's called T o m o r r o w's Memoirs.\n\nWanted to capture the message that a story is being told through my work when I shoot weddings or other celebrations and I also want to incorporate film. Hence the Quill pen made of film strip. I'm not the best Drawer. I have someone inking my sketches now so I can see what it looks like.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [IMG\\_0951.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203757/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0951.JPG) | 319.96 KB |\n| [IMG\\_0952.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203757/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0952.JPG) | 305.24 KB |\n| [IMG\\_0953.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203757/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0953.JPG) | 381.66 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "You need to be careful that people don't see the quill pen and think you're an illustrator or calligrapher. The film strip look (sprocket holes and visible frames) is clever but video doesn't have those.\n\nMaybe I'll change my mind when I see the finished art, but currently I don't think it's working. But keep working on it.\n\nVideo is a difficult concept for icons. People used to use VCR cassettes as icons, but those are rapidly disappearing. I know that film strips are still used sometimes as icons, but they really don't fit video. Maybe a video camera shape or a clapboard?\n\n\\> T o m o r r o w's Memoirs.\n\nNormally you don't space out characters when writing a company's name in plain text, even if it's widely spaced in the logo. It looks odd and if it's at the end of the line it could be broken into 2 lines with no hyphen.\n\n"

      "content": "Logos often need to be reproduced in a small size (business card, small web ad, etc), but in a small size the ink bottle becomes way too light and the sprocket holes disappear:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203757im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo3_6408.jpg)\n\nI would increase the line weight and make the sprocket holes fewer and larger. Remember this is an icon, not a literal representation.\n\nAlso the type spacing needs some tweaking. At the very least I'd move the T closer to the O and center the apostrophe between W and S. Also the type might be too light in small sizes, print it in small sizes as a test.\n\nAnd you might consider putting the name in 2 lines — at least when it's printed in small sizes —&nbsp;as in narrow-width situations the drawing will become small to accommodate the type's width.\n\n"
