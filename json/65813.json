This collection will be designed to go with most extra bold or black weight fonts, not just OverKill. I've researched other dingbat fonts and there is a lot of stuff that is useless (in my opinion). I wanted ask what dingbat glyphs other folks find useful and how they might be used. For instance, I saw a cool one the other day. On the side of a service van, there was a computer mouse at the front of the web address. I'm certain that it isn't new, I just hadn't noticed it.\n\nThanks  \nJames\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[_...from the Fontry_](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202002913/http:/www.thefontry.com/)\n\n",
