      "content": "Brandee,   \nIt's definitely a font, but as we ought to have in a FAQ, hand-printed fonts are very easy and cheap to make. This means an advertiser can use anyones printing to have a font made, and no one else would be able to duplicate it.   \n   \nThere are probably thousands of freeware fonts like this, for the same reason -- anyone can make them, or have them made for less than $10.   \n   \nClickArt has a set of 300 Handwritten (HW) fonts (now sold by Broderbund), and most foundries have a small scattering of hand-printed styles. [Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054932/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html) shows all the HW fonts, and many of the other commercial ones, with a sampling of some of the freeware ones. You can probably find something that is at least similar to this, if you are willing to wade through about 24 web pages. It's probably the most complete collection you can see in one place, if I say so myself.   \n   \nUnless you get very lucky, picking something similar is your best bet to avoid spending a lot of time.\n\n"
