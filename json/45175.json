I’ve found several typefaces which include Hebrew letters in their glyphs and have research a few classic typefaces to see if they offer Hebrew letters. Can anyone recommend a classic Hebrew typeface and where to buy it?

Hebrew is the reverse.\n\nSo your design will be as important as choice of typeface.\n\n"
