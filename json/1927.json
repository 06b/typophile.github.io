I'm looking to acquire some new designs for our SPOT product line ( [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/spot/default2.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526221230/http:/www.microsoft.com/resources/spot/default2.mspx)) which currently uses a bitmap font derived from Matthew Carter's Nina design.   \n   \nIf you're interested in working on this project please drop me a line, or if you have any recommendations as to those who are doing the best work in this field please pass on their details.   \n   \nCheers, Si   \n [simonda@microsoft.com](mailto:simonda@microsoft.com)\n\n",
