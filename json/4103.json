  "content": "I Find myself here, 1:57am unable to sleep -- nothing new really -- browsing through the latest issue of 'print' (magazine). Now it has been some time since I have read print -- and by read I actually mean 'reading' -- or any other 'design' magazine. I have recently started taking home these periodicals that have been piling up at the studio for the past few years. Tonight been one of the previously mentioned 'sleepless nights', I decide to pull out the latest issue and give it the once through. The issue contains a few good articles, one notably on clearview (the font)and its designers. But back to my original rant, has anyone seen the art direction of this magazine? More clearly the type setting? You would think a magazine of design -- printed design -- and one expressing 'opinions' on type and type design would in the least be set half way decent? I would provide scans, but as previously noted, Im in bed ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145321im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif). Im not even asking for anything great, like using type that does not come bundled with Adobe apps, but maybe something as simple as hanging punctuation. Is this too much to ask? I can't remember exactly what print looked like a year or so ago, but I don't rmemeber anyhting this lifeless, and dare I tout 'unprofessionally set'?   \n   \nCurious if I'm the only one with these thoughts.   \n   \nHildebrant.\n\n [‹ Fonts for social / political book cover?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145321/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4086 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#34;Snap to&#34; function for type objects in Illustrator CS ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145321/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4083 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In this past issue, it seems like they are trying **way** too hard to be hip. Even [Mirko Ilic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145321/http:/www.mirkoilic.com/)'s illustations (school 101 article) came out crappy. They need a redesign pronto if they want to keep up with HOW or Step.\n\n"
