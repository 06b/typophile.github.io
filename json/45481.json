  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m working on a new identity for a group of old serious people.  \nThe council discusses about socio-economic questions and submits it’s suggestions to the county.  \nAt the moment, they use the county’s id, but they would like to have their own identity.  \nThey want something that reflects what theay are, and that is also fresh, new and modern !  \nObviously, fresh, new and modern is miles away from what they are.\n\nI don’t feel like giving them a pictogram, so I was thinking about fresh colour and a logo of letters, but I already can hear them say “we could have done this by ourselves” (Yes that’s the kind of guys I’ve got to struggle with...)\n\nWell, I’m now after letters that would _look like a logo_.\n\nI thought at first of [reykjavik](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905211617/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/psyops/reykjavik_two_d_gauge_oblique_ot/) but the uppercase E was of a bit too much, I decided then on FF Sanuk Bold italic,\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905211617im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/sanuk_3994.jpg)\n\nI feel this might be not enough, any help or advice would be really appreciated\n\n [‹ Wire bindings: smart or cheap?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905211617/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45034 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Old punches, new fonts, Fry's Baskerville ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905211617/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45357 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This free article, with dozens of letter-linking concepts I hadn’t thought of, made me decide to subscribe to the magazine awhile back.\n\nYour particular group of letters might be easier to work into a design with lower case. All four letters would then contain curves.\n\nI think jupiterboy’s is being facetious with the cane idea...\n\n"

B¬)\n\nSeriously, I think it is often possible, with a bit of gentle education, C/W diagrams with circles and arrows, of what has been done elsewhere and what’s behind other successful designs to explain to them how visual communication works. If it were explained on the same simple level the stock market would need to explained to me, it should be possible to convince your clients of the merits of your concepts. Most people have absolutely no reason to have any understanding of what a designer does or what makes you an expert at it. What they think they want is something that’s flashy and cool when what they really want is something that talks to people on levels they don’t know exist. And why should they? Other people’s areas of expertise can be black boxes too. Perhaps you just need to give them a peek inside yours. They might get it. :o)\n\nOr, as was explained to me years ago, “Clients don’t know what they want. It’s your job to tell them.”\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

This article from B&A is really interesting, thanks.\n\n_it should be possible to convince your clients of the merits of your concepts_  \nRusselim, you’re right, but I am not sur myself of the merits of my concepts !\n\n+\n\n"
