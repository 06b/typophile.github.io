You do it once and the pairs stay kerned both throughout the document and whenever you use the font (in Quark). InDesign has no such feature, so that you have to manually kern the same pairs every time you use them. Obviously this is not a problem in fonts that are well kerned, but unfortunately they are not all so. I had hoped Adobe would put this feature into this upgrade. As Thomas explained it, the reason the feature hasn't been incorporated yet is that they want to make sure it works across all the CS applications. I argue that Illustrator and P-shop are not typesetting/layout programs to begin with, and that this feature would matter most to users of InDesign.\n\nTo me, while overall I prefer InDesign, this is really a glaring oversight.

I just hate rewarding the CS Suite division for ignoring long needed improvements in typography. No glyph palette in Photoshop is pathetically inexcusable. Why should I pay them for ignoring us? I know I am whizzing into the wind by thinking my non-upgrade will make a bit of difference to the MBAs who make the decisions. They see us as small potatoes. Adobe has gone from a company who were passionate about their products and customers to being just another big corporate bureaucracy just lost in boardroom humdrum and out of touch with what made them successful to begin with. Warnock actually gave a damn and gave Adobe a soul. Now, all it has is a balance sheet.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

The attributes come in with MS Word files, either via \"place\" or pasting from the clipboard: so long as I don't have ID strip text attributes, Word's language attributes are among those that survive transfer. Thus ID5 may not \"provide\" the Chinese attribute, but I didn't notice. I can use CJK attributes in English-language ID, and that's what matters to me.\n\nCome to think of it, perhaps it's just as well Adobe doesn't provide the attributes.
