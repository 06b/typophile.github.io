I'm getting so used to FontLab so it almost hurts when I have to draw in Illustrator.\n\nI have some memory that there is somekind of plugin that does this? Is it true? Anyone knows?\n\n",

Big trackballs are good for sore wrists, you do not hold anything down, just flick the cursor or handles around and click or let go again to set. Saved my carpal tunnel.\n\n"

      "content": "I actually started out with Photoshop and Illustrator long before I ever got into type design. When I finally started working with Fontlab, I found the vector tool really weird, and for a while I insisted on drawing in Illustrator. As I've worked more and more with Fontlab, I've grown used to its tools, and often find them better than Illustrator. They're definitely better for doing certain kinds of precision work...but for some jobs Illustrator is better. They're both based on different philosophies about how vectors should work. Going back to illustrator doesn't bother me. I think in part that's because I use it for different sorts of work.\n\n—Noam\n\n"

(It's like getting bad 'free' coffee at work) ;-)  \nI've had that experience with programs and types of computer all my career.(Macs & Pcs)\n\nGreat Graphic art and programs were around before Illustrator.  \nGreat Fonts were around before FontLab.  \nWhat is boring, is evangelism.  \n(I've rid myself of that with Computers, still struggling with Apps)\n\nJust curious Goran...Chicken or the Egg?  \nWhy not a Plug-In that makes FontLab act like Illustrator?  \nOr CorelDraw?  \nOr FreeHand?  \nOr has FontLab after all these other Apps supposedly failed, achieved bezier drawing nirvana?  \nHmmm...\n\n"

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of things Adobe can do to improve Illustrator, but drawing the basic drawing tools work great for me. This topic comes up from time to time, and I've been curious to know what the actual problems are that make people hate it.\n\n"

Since I started using FontLab a few years ago, it's become harder for me to work in Illustrator. It's mainly because of FontLab's keyboard shortcuts for moving Bézier control handles and nodes, being able to slide nodes along a curve, being able to enter values for the length of control handles, and other little things that come in especially handy for drawing glyphs.\n\n"

      "content": "There's an excellent article in the March issue of Creative Review (UK) regarding Freehand users. There are still a surprising number of designers still using this sadly obsolete software. I have always preferred Freehand to Illustrator for drawing letters as it is just so much easier to use. Switching to FontLab was an easy transition as its' drawing behaviour is almost exactly the same as Freehand. I hate so many things about drawing with Illustrator - the way that you can't constrain angles when pulling a handle being the main gripe, selecting handles, having to use different pointers (why?), not being able to manipulate a section of a glyph, etc. It's a shame that when Adobe acquired Freehand they didn't incorporate Freehand's ease of drawing into Illustrator instead of just burying it. I still draw all logos in Freehand and then export the file to Illustrator and resave.\n\nI hope Freehand never becomes incompatible with the latest operating system otherwise Im buggered. Or maybe I'll have to use FontLab and copy and paste to Illustrator.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

A friend of mine mentioned in passing the other day that there is a plug-in that lets you hold handle angles like Freehand does. I believe the plug-in he mentioned is the same one that is linked to above. I'm downloading it as I type to see for sure.\n\nHopefully this will be a non-issue in the next version of Illustrator.\n\n"
