It should be something that isn’t overly masculine - no heavy sans faces - and distressed faces are out too.\n\nIt’s not a newstand title as such so there isn’t that need to punch out from the shelf and perhaps this allows me leeway to pick something with a little more personality.\n\nHave looked at what seems like a million typefaces and so far I’m stumped so any suggestions would be gladly received!\n\n [‹ Why is it so common for typefaces to include small caps in only one weight, such as regular/medium?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122847/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39913 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [help needed- which typeface would pair well with Clarendon? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122847/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39855 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
