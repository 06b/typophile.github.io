  "content": "Hi,\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions for a body text typeface to use in a music-related book project in combination with FF Din Round Pro in lowercase for headlines. So far I've tried Transat Text, Trade Gothic, Gotham and Chattype but none have been the one yet.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
