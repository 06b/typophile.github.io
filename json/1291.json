I will use this type in the actual mark, as well as for the body text of all printed materials -- so it needs to be somewhat flexible. Cobalt data is a database and programming/development software company. Not selling software, but strictly development for clients, mostly server side applications.   \n   \nLooking for something to reflect this, something with a touch of a technical feel, but something that could be flexible enough to set body text in, for example NOT a titling face. Preferably 3 or so weights, small caps and ligatures are always a plus, especially considering the amount of acronyms in an IT field such as this.   \n   \nSo, suggestions? Also the customer is looking to stay in the $150 ceiling price range.   \n   \nthanks!   \n   \nhildebrant.\n\n",

Remember most people using this site won't get it anyway, they are more concerned with content than the shapes of the letters, especially in text size formats.
