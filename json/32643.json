  "content": "I have just begun work on this. As you can see, there are a lot of issues. Some of the character widths are incorrect, stem widths are inconsistant, and there are notches in strange areas.\n\nI am looking for just general comments. Does the face have potential? Any thoughts on the notches? I think I will use them throughout the face, but I will have to see how they work out.\n\nAlthough this face is inspired by Clarendon, I frequently deviate quite a bit from my intentions. I am aware this concept has been done before( [http://www.typography.com/catalog/leviathan/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/leviathan/index.html \"http://www.typography.com/catalog/leviathan/index.html\")), but I think I can bring something new to it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705im_/http:/typophile.com/files/clarendon-sans_6309.gif)\n\nMore to come tommorrow.\n\nJeremy Dooley  \n [http://www.insignedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705/http:/www.insignedesign.com/ \"http://www.insignedesign.com\")\n\n",

I like whats going on with the K, R, etc. I need to incorporate that in the rest of the uppercase, and generally make it more organic. The lower is somewhat reminiscent of Frutiger, surprisingly. I've tenatively entitled it Kinshasa.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Khartoumn_4403.gif)\n\n"

I would have liked to have done something with them, but they weren't working with the rest of the glyphs. I did keep them as alternates, however.\n\nI've attached a .pdf, in addition to the image below, if anyone wants to take a closer look at the letterforms. Ignore the temporary spacing for now.

      "content": "Your 's' and 'S' look like they have been turned upside down. Also, the thickest part of the s should be the spine.  \nUsually, the crossbar of the 'F' is a little bit lower then that of the 'E', to fill up the lower gap (but not necessarily so).  \nThe 'g' doesn't work yet, for the most part it lacks the contrast between thick/thins. Maybe you can look into 'bdpq', and design some of them individually, instead of flipping b and d. :) I think your 'L' arm should be shortened a bit.  \nAside from that, there are the general bezier-inconsistencies.\n\nKeep working on it!  \nOn a sidenote; I just read 'Designing Type', by Karen Cheng, a while ago, which is a very good book that discusses every character of an alphabet in detail. Maybe you can use it for designing this typeface. :) I know it helped me design mine.\n\n"

I may need to go back to these characters again. There may be an issue with these characters falling over. I shortened the L slightly.\n\nYou mentioned \"general bezier-inconsisencies.\" Can you be more specific?\n\nI actually own 'Designing Type' and agree that it is a very fine resource. Thank you very much for your input.\n\nI am still not really happy with the k right now, and I need to do a few more rounds of revisions.\n\nCurrent status:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kishasatypo_4449.jpg)\n\nPDF version: [http://www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/kinshasa2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705/http:/www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/kinshasa2.pdf \"http://www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/kinshasa2.pdf\")\n\nJeremy Dooley  \n [www.insignedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705/http:/www.insignedesign.com/ \"www.insignedesign.com\")\n\n"

A longer lower-left terminal might help.\n\nThe 'g' is better, with the contrast, but I find the connection between of the tail a bit abrupt. Now it is more a tail with a circle attached, but I think it would be nicer if it would flow, so to speak, into the lower shape, like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705im_/http:/typophile.com/files/g-glyph_6672.gif)\n\nBut then again, that is just my opinion. :)\n\n"

Thank you for pointing out the issues with s and a.\n\nDan,\n\nI have also updated the k. This works quite a bit better.\n\nAlthough I am using the Clarendon as inspiration, I don't feel I need to stay with it exactly. I like to use the use of a face as an inspiration, rather than the actual face itself. I would say, however, that this has come closer to \"Clarendon Sans\" that I would have imagined.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but it has a very \"British\" feel to it. It reminded me of walking through Gatwick airport, for some reason. Because of this, I have renamed the typeface to \"Stratham.\"\n\nLatest PDF: [http://www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/stratham.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705/http:/www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/stratham.pdf \"http://www.insignedesign.com/pdfs/stratham.pdf\")\n\nThanks to all that have commented so far.\n\nJeremy Dooley  \nwww.insignedesign.com\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021705im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Stratham_4952.jpg)\n\n"
