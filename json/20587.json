I could set this up myself, but since I am rather novice in FOG maybe I will forget about some classes.\n\nI’m about to all by myself produce my first commercial font that is going to be distributed, so I want to make sure I make everything correct and don’t forget about something.\n\nSo I was thinking there perhaps could be some resources out there? Template-files and such for this kind of matters?\n\nThanks, and kind regards from Sweden!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201030913im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/assistancemetrics_5808.png)\n\n [‹ Another optical trick?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201030913/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20466 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Converting Fonts from Mac to Win ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201030913/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19246 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "The problem with using already built sets of classes is that one set will not work with all fonts. It’s not that hard to build a set from scratch and you are guaranteed that it will be optimized for the font you are working on.\n\nI don’t use Fontographer anymore, but the principle is the same for any font editor. I start out by analyzing all my glyphs, sorting them into groups with similar right or left sides. This becomes the basis for my kerning classes. Keep in mind that you don’t necessarily want to group accented glyphs with their unaccented counterparts. Also keep in mind that some character combinations may never come up in normal use.\n\nYes, it can be a bit tedious, but there isn’t really any short cut that works better than thorough planning and methodical follow-through. With some people, it helps to have music on. I like to listen to audio books or talk radio.\n\n"
