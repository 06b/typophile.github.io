  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI was looking at using Garamond for a project, but then I got so confused by the sheer amount of garamonds out there that I don't know which is the best one to use. I'm looking for a versatile version, that could also work when used in small sizes. What are the pros and cons of the different versions?\n\nAnother question related to this one is: which sans-serif font works well next to garamond? I'm doing a map related project, so possibly a font that can take a beating; by being used in small sizes and still be legible.\n\nI hope you can help me with this one!\n\nThanks, Jeffrey  \n [infraordinaire](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306211234/http:/http/www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress)\n\n",

      "content": "Jeffrey, this matter has been raised before in this forum - you can see a few links to Garamond related threads here: [http://typophile.com/node/12481](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306211234/http:/typophile.com/node/12481 \"http://typophile.com/node/12481\") (see bottom of page) - keep in mind that there have been dozens of different interpretations of Garamond typefaces.\n\nAs a personal taste, I'd go with Adobe Garamond Pro or Sabon Next, both well done and working digital typefaces.\n\nBut there can also be some interesting alternatives, like Epic [http://www.typetrust.com/font/epic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306211234/http:/www.typetrust.com/font/epic \"http://www.typetrust.com/font/epic\") or Augereau [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/abramslegacy/augereau/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306211234/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/abramslegacy/augereau/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/abramslegacy/augereau/\")\n\nBy the way, lists of Garamond-ish typefaces can be found here:\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/search/garamond/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306211234/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/garamond/fonts/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/search/garamond/fonts/\")\n\n[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=garamond&q=Go](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306211234/http:/www.identifont.com/find?font=garamond&q=Go \"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=garamond&q=Go\")\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=garamond&x=0&y=0](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306211234/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=garamond&x=0&y=0 \"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=garamond&x=0&y=0\")\n\nA sans compatible with Garamond should be a Humanist Sans, I guess. Syntax is the first that comes to mind.\n\n"

      "content": "I have mixed feelings about Garamond Premier Pro. Yes, it has optical sizes, and yes, it is historically more accurate than Slimbach's previous Garamond (Premier also has a wide range of glyphs and languages). But I find it too delicate, with its very detailed strokes; Garamond Pro seems more \"strong\" on the page, if you know what I mean (pardon my lack of technical competence). What I like in Premier, instead, is its economy - compare Premier (abobe) with Pro (below), and see how the text block looks more tight in the first paragraph.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306211234im_/http:/typophile.com/files/garamond_adobe_5704.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "That's pretty impressive. But I guess I'm quite confused now; I like Premier being economincal, but it needs to be pretty sturdy as well. As Pro seems more strong on a page, this is a bit of a dilemma.

What I find \"too delicate\" in Premier may be a quality for someone else. And my avatar speaks for itself.\n\n"
