  "content": "Hi there  \nI have always wanted to make an ambigram.  \nJust for fun, but never came around to it.  \nBeside that I did't like the blackletter-style, medieaval-styl ambigrams. So I never started on it. No idea what else they should look like.\n\nBut finaly I did and am very surprised by the outcome.\n\nI think I made an ambigram that is perfectly readible upside down, but even on its sides! Well, I think it does.\n\nPlease share your thoughts.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ambigram.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419114536/http:/typophile.com/files/ambigram_0.pdf) | 217.9 KB |\n\n",

What do you think?\n\nA few days later - by the way - I realized that it didn't matter from which angle you look at our yellow spot in the sky. It remains circular.\n\nA revelation.\n\nWow.\n\n"
