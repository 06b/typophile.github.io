I dont like the bottom curve...   \nlc 'w' and 'v': maybe to gemetrical   \nlc 'x': Great! But will it work in small size?   \nI like the curves of the round glyphes!   \nThe tail of lc'y' maybe needs a point at the end (maybe also for 'j' 'f' and 'c')   \n   \nGreetings to you!   \n   \nJens\n\n"

Currently it looks like that the downstroke goes in a little curve...   \n   \nThe Uppercase is a first sketch i see so you improve anyway... Horizontal lines are very diffrent Compare lc 'E' and 'L'   \n   \nHappy fonting!\n\n"
