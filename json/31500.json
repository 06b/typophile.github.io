  "content": "Hey I am looking for a font similar to the one in the picture, or ways to recreate a similar feel to the typography. I need to make about 7 names for the doors inside of a day spa, the rooms are labeled \"Roma\" or \"Capri\" etc. So i need to recreate these names in the look of the attached picture.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101123093303im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMGP1081_4924.JPG)\n\nWe have a sign painter to paint the names on the door however he apparantly needs us to create the type exactly as he will paint them and can't for some reason do it himself.\n\nIf i can find a type face that matches close enough, or a good substitute with the same feel, that will be fine. Otherwise I might look into hiring a lettering artist to do it for me.\n\nThanks!  \n-Jesse\n\n",
