I probably can find something similar on the sans, but it’s the serif font I am most desparate for.\n\nIt has details of many serif fonts, but nothing that I have come across matches this. I have tried “whatthefont” - nothing.\n\nIs this available in a digital format? Can anyone ID either font?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [File](http://web.archive.org/web/20060604042224/http:/typophile.com/files/drupal_17) | 16.25 KB |\n\n",
