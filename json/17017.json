The face was discontinued for quality and consistency reasons in 1998 when Image Club was still part of [Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20090925023630/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Adobe).\n\nSince it was discontinued and Agfa not longer distributes the family as part of [the current Image Club library](http://web.archive.org/web/20090925023630/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/searchresults.htm?st=5&cid=Image+Club), the only place that Andrich Minerva is still available is on an old copy of the Image Club LetterPress disc. I believe I still have a couple of lightly-used copies of this disc, if you are interested in obtaining one.\n\nHere are a couple of samples set in Image Club’s Andrich Minerva using the text from your image.
