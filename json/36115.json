Look for the Nadine Chahine cameo as they work on Arabic Palatino.\n\n[http://stream.qtv.apple.com/qtv/plexifilm/zapfextra\\_ref.mov](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907033154/http:/stream.qtv.apple.com/qtv/plexifilm/zapfextra_ref.mov \"http://stream.qtv.apple.com/qtv/plexifilm/zapfextra\\_ref.mov\")\n\nCheers,\n\n-Gary\n\n [‹ What are good external HDD's to preserve data](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907033154/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36183 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Favicon for Typophile ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907033154/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36164 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

When we showed up, they told us, “Hermann Zapf happens to be here today.” And we were like, “Does he want to talk about Helvetica?” And they said, “Not really. But he’ll talk to you for 15 minutes, after lunch.” So we didn’t have that much time with him. The interview was actually shot on the patio of the lunch room at Linotype. It looks so lush and tropical! All the Linotype staff have gotten a good laugh out of that.\n\n"

But you can also read some elements from his biography online, particularly these two links –\n\n[http://www.linotype.com/1494-12706/fromnuremberg.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907033154/http:/www.linotype.com/1494-12706/fromnuremberg.html \"http://www.linotype.com/1494-12706/fromnuremberg.html\")  \n [http://www.linotype.com/1494-12707/atthecartographicunit.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907033154/http:/www.linotype.com/1494-12707/atthecartographicunit.html \"http://www.linotype.com/1494-12707/atthecartographicunit.html\")\n\n"
