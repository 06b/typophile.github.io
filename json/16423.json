Unless you absolutely need to match this sample I think you’d do better to use an existing font like Bodoni Open.\n\n"

From this I made an upper case typeface with the logo built-in as 2 keystrokes.\n\nI know the peak of the A extends up way too far, I couldn’t see the logic of it myself, but the client knows best.
