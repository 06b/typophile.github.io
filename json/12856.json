The 'y' is about the only oddball letter I can see here. T-26 Flux matches the general shapes, but the details are not the same.\n\nAnyone recognize this one?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font-id2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20101126153603/http:/typophile.com/files/font-id2.gif) | 37.93 KB |\n\n",
