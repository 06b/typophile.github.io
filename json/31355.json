If you just have the .PFB and .AFM, then you probably have these fonts configured for Linux/Unix.\n\nAssuming you have Windows 2000, XP or Vista, and the right bits, you can look up instructions all over - e.g. [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/fixfonts/ht/psfonts\\_winxp.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20070403074821/http:/desktoppub.about.com/cs/fixfonts/ht/psfonts_winxp.htm)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
