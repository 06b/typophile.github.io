      "content": "LOL - I have never known myself. Just about every font that was given such a number is a rip-off of a well-known font.  \nI don't know if you are familiar with: [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/findafont/a/fontaliases\\_f.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20111216181425/http:/desktoppub.about.com/cs/findafont/a/fontaliases_f.htm \"http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/findafont/a/fontaliases\\_f.htm\") -- it is a handy reference and lets you know all the \"real\" names for Bitstream fonts. I've started you off in the \"F\" section....\n\n"
