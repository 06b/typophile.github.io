The whole spread is given an antique-like feel. It's hard to tell in the scan, but the image used is scanned (or seems to be scanned it) in and used as a background texture for the layout. There is more than one spread like this in the book, and I found it very fitting that this particular type of image (texture) be in a literary magazine.. \n",
