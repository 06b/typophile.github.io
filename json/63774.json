  "content": "Hey all,\n\nI'm doing my thesis on the role of the serif in Latin and non-Latin writing systems.\n\nI would like to start with the Latin writing system.  \n1. Origin of the Serif  \n2. Different shapes of Serifs  \n3. It's role in readability/legibility  \n4. It's role as a decorative element\n\nThen it was my plan to apply that scheme to other writing systems, such as Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, Arabic, Devenagari, Cyrillic, Greek...(These are the possible candidates. I won't discuss them all. )\n\nI would work as following:  \nIs there a serif/equivalent to a serif?  \nDoes it have a name? What's its origin?  \nDoes it improve readability/legibility?  \nOr does it merely exist for esthetical reasons?\n\nI have some questions I would like to ask you:  \n1. Is this a good idea all together? Should I just stick with Latin?  \n2. Do you know any good books on any of these writing systems?\n\n",

      "content": "This sounds very interesting.\n\nYou should also discuss and compare the notion of readability as it has changed over time, such as from print to screen. While serif designs are generally considered to be the most readable in print, when it comes to mobile devices, sans serif is generally better, perhaps due to the more uniform stem widths. In fact, some sans serif designs actually have small serif-like thingies at the terminals, or the stroke terminals are flared. The serifs and flares are actually detrimental when it comes to mobile device use.\n\nBTW, I cover CJK writing systems in [_CJKV Information Processing_, Second Edition](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131131447/http:/oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514471/), though I don't cover the topic of readability per se.\n\nDr. Ken Lunde  \nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV Type Development  \nAdobe Systems Incorporated  \n [lunde@adobe.com](mailto:lunde@adobe.com)\n\n"

      "content": "To me the most interesting angle in this topic is the role of serifs in the relationships in multi-script systems. Let me give an example from my own experience. When making a text face with Latin and Armenian components, the Latin (Roman) can be upright and can possess the conventional serif scheme without problems\\*, but if one follows the (flawed) tradition of making the Armenian based very closely on the Latin one ends up with upright forms and... too many serifs! Because the Armenian \"x-height\" is choc full of vertical stems. One alternative is to give the Armenian a slanted semi-serif form; one reason this works well is Armenian needs Italics far less than Latin (since it has a floating emphasis mark that can be placed on any vowel). Now, if one makes the Armenian upright, semi-serifs cause the letteforms to appear slightly backslanted\\*\\*. I have an article about all this entitled \"Latinization: Prevention and Cure\" in back issues of both Spatium and Hyphen - it might be useful to read it.\n\n\\* Not that there's no room for massive innovation in this area!\n\n\\*\\* Although Bloemsma showed an interesting solution to this in his Avance.\n\nHere's one view of the type system in question:  \n [http://themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131131447/http:/themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf \"http://themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf\")\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks everyone for the help.\n\n@hartmannsgruber: I will certainly try to get a hold of Huda Smitshuijzen Abifares' book\n\n@Ken Lunde: I will discuss readability in relation to different types of media/circumstances. E.g.: Low resolution screens and highway signs demand a simpler letterform; a sans...\n\n@Hrant: thanks for the very interesting examples. I love the solution of a slightly slanted, semi-serif roman as a companion to the armenian font. Very nice to see the latin being moddeled after the Armenian, instead of the (usual) other way around.\n\nThe role of serifs in relation to multi-script systems is indeed the interessanting angle. Unfortunatly I don't speak/read any language in a non-Latin script. So I won't be able to do extensive research and I will have to rely on other people since I can't tell wether a certain script has been latinized and if the result looks odd\n\nThanks again  \nWouter\n\n"
