Such as (Theh with Khah ثخ (.\n\nWhen I created a pdf file with Adobe Acrobat and open it in Adobe Reader or in Acrobat itself and try to search to theh with Khah ثخ, I didn’t find it.  \nAcrobat and some program can't find any glyph or a ligature didn't have a Unicode codepage.  \nHow could I solve that?  \nIf I give this glyph (ligature) a Unicode code from unicode private area, could I find it. Did Acrobat or other program support Private Area (UPA)?  \nTo whom had Mac computer, shall we face the same problems.\n\nIf we used non Unicode fonts to create the pdf file and try to use search to any glyph, it didn't find anything. (It didn't find the base glyph such Jeem, beh … etc)\n\nBest~\n\nHasan Abu Afash  \n [www.hibastudio.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725111844/http:/www.hibastudio.com/ \"www.hibastudio.com\")  \n [hasan@hibastudio.com](mailto:hasan@hibastudio.com)\n\n",

      "content": "If glyphs in a font are named according to Adobe's \"uniXXXXYYYY....\" [Glyph Naming Convention](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725111844/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html) then you can search in PDF files and cut and paste text from PDF to other applications since Acrobat can re-construct the Unicode characters of the original text by parsing the glyph names. This works even for ligatures which do not correspond to a single Unicode code point and have no Unicode index in the font.\n\nIf glyphs in a complex script font are named in any other manner this doesn't work - so results will differ from font to font.\n\nI also don't know which non-Adobe PDF viewers support this.\n\n- Chris\n\n"
