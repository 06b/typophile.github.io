Thanks for adding the link picard102 :)\n\nI'll have a think about the issue with small sizes.\n\nHowever, i've tried to use the \"tagline\" with farnham regular, but it gives no contrast to the wordtype and they are both very stable, so  \ni think it added an intresting contrast having the tagline in italic and swash.\n\n"

The A and V stand out to me right away as having stroke weights that are too thin in comparison to, say, the R and the L.\n\n"
