Nick's are the same as the ones shown for Parsons in McGrew's book on \"American Metal Typefaces..\", so this tells me the P in the sample was a customization, and not from the original design. In fact the swash initials were not in the original design — Sidney Gaunt designed them, and Ransom did not approve them all, yet McGrew says they were cast by BB&S.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
