  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am in the process of developing a logotype. I started off with an uppercase B set in Foundry Wilson and combined it with part of a serif of an uppercase ‘B’ set in French script. I then chopped off the serif from the top left corner of the Foundry Wilson ‘B’ and rounded it off. I quite like the quirky shape that comes out of it.\n\nMy Logotype will have three words. I thought it might be easier to use a san serif font instead of the Foundry Wilson, as it is easier to add to a character than subtract.\n\nFor this project I am looking for a sans serif with varying stroke thicknesses, similar to that of Foundry Wilson. Any ideas?\n\nClient restrictions mean that I cannot post the B on the Internet. Sorry!\n\n",
