Each game kicks off on Monday with a new challenge, and closes at midnight PST on Friday. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May the best designer win.\n\nLink directly to this thread: [http://www.typophile.com/battle15](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021121656/http:/www.typophile.com/battle15)\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Size: 600 width x 400 height. 72 dpi  \n- Color: Black and white only  \n- Format: Please save your graphics as PNG  \n- Only respond with the characters posted in the challenge.\n\n// THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE:  \n// Create an italic lower case for a serif typeface. The characters should have high stroke contrast and be tuned for display at 72pt. The strokes should be based on a pointed nib pen. For bonus points: add a swash ff ligature.\n\n",

When you say 72pt, is that measured by the cap height? ie x height would then be ~36-40 pt? (I figured I would design it at that size)\n\n"

You could also have a look at Bodoni italic for an example of the style that is asked for.\n\n"

As Sebastian mentioned, what is important is that you upload the design as a PNG.\n\nI'd guess most people are working in Illustrator (or an equivalent), or maybe a combination of AI and Fontlab (that is, if you are like Christian, master battler, and building functional fonts every time). Drawing entirely by hand and using a scanner is also an acceptable method.\n\n"
