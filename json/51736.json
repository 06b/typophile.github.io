  "content": "Hey people,\n\nI'm currently designing and typesetting a poetrybook. It's an anthology concerning the master piece or masterwork (which an apprentice had to make to be allowed in to a guild), and I want to give it a bit of a 1400's feel. I would like to have some suggestions for typefaces that breathe that era. I'm thinking Jenson / Aldus / Elzevir books here.\n\nThere are some great typefaces in that style, like Jannon from StormType and also Dos Santos' new Capsa. But I would like to have a few alternatives. It's not really important that it is a true revival. Types that are inspired by them are also welcome.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

He bases a lot of his work on old type designs, or handwriting, and some of them would certainly give an antique air to poetry settings.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Both Requiem and Augustin are excellent suggestions. I think they could both work, especially Requiem (and it's cheap?!). I think we might have Requiem at work, so I can hopefully make a few test settings tomorrow.\n\nThe Sherwood types look nice, but I think a bit too quirky for this book.\n\nIf someone has more suggestions, they are certainly welcome.\n\n"
