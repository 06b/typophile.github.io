  "content": "Hi all\n\nThe Christianity Explored logo is established and has been in use for some years now, so that’s not changing any time soon (to my knowledge).  \nHowever, the strapline ‘Time to Discover’ is a new addition.\n\nIn order to bring some 'relational' warmth to the CXP logo, we've attempted to go down the handwritten route. What do you think of these three routes?\n\n- First option is using a font, 'SF Scribbled Sans' - a free download from 1001fonts.com.\n\n- Second and Third options are (digitally) handdrawn with Wacom and Illustrator CS3\n\nYour feedback (positive or negative), would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you,\n\nCarl\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023141542im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cxp_ttd_example_3584.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Message to 'elms':\n\nThanks for your feedback re. the second option.\n\nIn response to your question, ‘why are you disrepecting the very thing you are trying to promote?’\n\nFirstly as Sharon pointed out, I didn't design the Christianity Explored logo, and it is not currently up for change, as I mentioned in my original post. But even if I had designed it, I would have no problem with representing the cross like that. I think most Christians would agree it does not disrepect the Lord Jesus to show the cross at an angle, or even 'falling down'. The Lord Jesus himself fell down whilst carrying his cross to be crucified. We Christians believe it was the most amazing act of courage and self-sacrificial love this world has ever seen. And according to Jesus' own words in the Bible (John chapter 3 verse 16 to 36, for example), the way to disrespect him is not by how we visually represent his cross, rather it is to continue in unbelief, refusing to turn from our sin and accept him as Lord and follow him. I did that for many years myself, until 3.5 years ago he saved me by his amazing grace.

May he bless you too, in his name, Carl.\n\n"
