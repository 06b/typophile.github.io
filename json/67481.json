But I’ve never heared of this typeface before ... The look is very close to [Umbra](http://web.archive.org/web/20120507000509/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/umbra/regular/characters.html), but it’s not the same (see especially M and J). I couldn’t find a digital Plastica nor much information about the Designer Herbert Post. I just wonder if anyone has some deeper information about it ... Where does the Pentagram people find it?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120507000509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/plastica_5144.jpg)\n Best, Viktor \n",

      "content": "While Gill Sans Light Shadowed is indeed very similar, it’s not identical – see especially J, R, Z.  \nMaybe Pentagram has made this typeface up? To me, it looks like they modified Umbra (Futura Shadowed) and/or Gill, made it look like a kind of Neuzeit Grotesk Shadowed and gave it the name of the stylistically related – and forgotten – Berthold face that Indra has shown. While it is not out of the question that Herbert Post has designed such a typeface, it would surprise me – in consideration of his work as far as I know it.\n\n"

BTW, I see no R in Viktor's photo.\n\nPS: Just looked up my copy of Umbra BT which looks more like Viktor's sample than what kupfers posted. Only J and M are different (smaller details in other letters aside).  \nAndreas\n\n"

Those two are not attribute to a special designer in Berthold’s records.\n\n((Hei Henning, can you have a look in your Berthold Hauptproben?))\n\n"
