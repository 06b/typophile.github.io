  "content": "Both Word and PowerPoint 2008 for Mac are displaying some Postscript fonts incorrectly. There are 3 different menus which list fonts in Word 2008, and the fonts in question are sometimes missing certain styles in one menu, and missing others in a different menu. We are most concerned about a Bitstream font called Geometric 415. I have tried to tweak the font menu names in TransType Pro, with some success, but cannot get the problem to completely go away. I have contacted Microsoft, Bitstream, and the place we bought the fonts from, but with no luck yet.\n\nAny Ideas would be most appreciated.\n\n [‹ Windows Font Managers (vista 64 bit)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013084406/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45288 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [ITC's Lame-o promotion ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013084406/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45400 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
