When people see my identity, I want them to come up with an image of “modern” and a somewhat image of elegance. So I came up with putting my own font into a circle and it looked great. As for the text “Aussté Design”. I chose the font Britanica. I especially loved the shape of the “A” and “g”. I just couldn’t get my eye off it.\n\nSo please tell me what you think.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090505173703/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_47.jpg) | 19.93 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hmm ... when I look at your website, I see even more flaws with your design. The problem is your application of Britanica: just because it’s not Helvetica doesn’t mean it doesn’t carry the same issues of blandness and lack of originality that the poor use of Helvetica carries.\n\nAnd yes, the touching letters isn’t working for you. Again, it lends a derivative sense to the whole design.\n\nThe ’A’ is much more interesting, if not in need of tweaking. If you’ve designed the ’A’ from scratch, why not match it by creating a complementary font for the name?\n\n—  \nNick Hladek\n\n"
