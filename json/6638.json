I tried to read through the Microsoft OpenType spec but it was like eating a box of rocks, a little hard to swallow. All I want to do is code the font so that \"ss\" and other dual characters that I set up will automatically be replaced with \"s s.Alt\" etc.   \n   \nCan someone point me to an easy guide to the programming side of OTFs, or let me know which code sequence I should be using?\n\n",

If we know what tools you are using, we can provide more precise advice.   \n   \nBasically, though, you want to create a set of substitution lookups for the Contextual Alternates \\<calt\\> layout feature. I use VOLT for OpenType, so in VOLT syntax I would express your example in this way:   \n   \n s -\\> s.alt   \n s |   \n   \nThe bar in the second line indicates the context, so this substitution would occur whenever preceded by s.   \n   \nSomeone else can probably explain the FontLab / Adobe FDK syntax better than I can. I always have to go and read the manual again whenever I do any OT work directly in FontLab.\n\n"

For example, if you have an ss ligature with a glyph name of \"s\\_s\" (not to be confused with the German eszett), you could do:   \n   \nfeature liga {   \nsub s s by s\\_s;   \n} liga;   \n   \nOr for a contextual substitution where you get a different ss ligature when ss comes after the letter \"e\"   \n   \nfeature clig {   \nsub e s' s' by s\\_s.alt;   \n} clig;   \n   \nNote that you would want to put the clig feature ahead of the liga feature to make that work. Otherwise you'd already have the s\\_s ligature and that substitution wouldn't fire.

      "content": "_Scripts - typefaces? or programming issue?_   \n   \nHeh, sorry, neither. The term 'complex script' is used to refer to a writing system in which there is not a simple sequential rendering of glyphs relative to character codes. So Latin is typically considered a simple or non-complex script, because there is a one-to-one relationship between the characters that you type and the glyphs that appear on your screen, which are simply laid out in a line. Of course, once you start including ligatures, variant letters, dynamic accent positioning, etc. Latin ceases to be so simple, but it remains differentiated from complex scripts in the sense of writing systems that require complex processing simply in order to be readable. So, for example, Arabic is a complex script because individual letters may take different forms depending on where they occur in a word or what the adjacent letters are, and this is normative behaviour for the writing system.   \n   \n   \n_you design Indian and Arabic fonts?_   \n   \nI have not designed any Indian typefaces yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I've done Thai (with Fiona Ross and Tim Holloway), which is related to the Indic writing systems. I've collaborated (again, with Fiona and Tim) on Arabic font development, although Tim does most of the actual design and I have the fun job of making the complex script stuff work with OpenType lookups. The most complex thing I've had to both design and build was the SBL Hebrew font for Biblical Hebrew.\n\n"

      "content": "I don't speak most of the languages for which I design type. Even if I spoke one language for each of the scripts for which I design, that would still be only a tiny percentage of the actual languages written in those scripts. Speaking or reading knowledge of a language is not necessary to design for 'foreign' scripts. It is important to have a good understanding of the history and development of the script, or to work closely with people who do. I try to understand scripts as systems, in terms of construction, relationship to language and grammar, etc. Most often, I arrange to have my work reviewed by an experienced typographer who is a native user of the script, unless I'm particularly confident in my knowledge of a script or can't find someone with the appropriate skills and experience.   \n   \nI started designing for non-Latin scripts in 1997, when I tried my first Cyrillic design. At the time, I was mainly looking for a way to expand the number of shapes I got to draw: I was getting bored of Latin letters. Later I realised that I'd accidentally stumbled into one of the few growth areas in this business, and also one in which few of my colleagues were working.   \n   \n   \nYou can make plenty of non-Latin typefaces without VOLT. You only need VOLT if the script requires OpenType Layout features that are not supported in FontLab yet, e.g. anchor attachment positioning. Since VOLT is a Windows tool, you need to either be running a Windows machine or VirtualPC to make complex script OT fonts. You can, of course, make AAT format complex script fonts using free tools from Apple, but the tools are ludicrously difficult and the format has only minimal application support and is not cross-platform compatible.   \n   \nA lot of people who start out in Latin script type design come to it from a North American or European graphic design background, in which the Mac is still the most common tool. But for non-Latin font development and _use_ Windows is a much more common platform. Personally, when I look at the range of font development applications and tools that are available on Windows, many of them free, I really can't see any point in using a Mac. Windows is simply a better font development environment. This is not to say that typical Latin font makers are missing out on anything by using a Mac: if everything you need to do can be done in FontLab, then it doesn't matter what platform you are on. But I have upwards of 20 font development and testing applications on my system, which perform a variety of functions including things that cannot be done in FontLab and which have no parallel on the Mac. Now, I should also point out that most of my clients are major software developers, who have very strict technical quality assurance requirements, so the kind of non-critical bug that might pass unnoticed in the average Latin retail font is not acceptable in my work. And if, for example, my client says they want a TT font to have a version 3 OS/2 table and a format 3 post table, I need to be able to deliver that, even if FontLab doesn't have these options yet.   \n   \n   \nSBL is the Society of Biblical Literature, a scholarly organisation that is one of my clients.\n\n"

Virtually all Latinized non-Latin fonts reduce readability through blind fealty to formalism (eg matching x-heights), and pretty much every single Latin face that's made to look like some non-Latin script or other can only ever be a cute, naive display face.
