(for that the posts from Miguel and Fredo are perfect)\n\nI feel a bit intimidated by the typography studios, (i don’t know that much about type) i think i rather start in a graphic design studio where the expectations about my knowledge of type won’t be as high... Besides, i don’t know if i have that much to offer back in a studio where they strictly design type!!!\n\nI’ll be waiting for your recommendations  \nThanks!\n\n"
