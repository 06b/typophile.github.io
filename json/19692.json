  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m in my first year graphic & typographic design at KABK, and I’m working on a project which is to develop my own logo.\n\nI want it to have a very actual look, yet with a good sense of tradition. Nimble yet sturdy.\n\nI found the Silom a quite appropriate typeface, very ’electronic’ but quite round.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811070235im_/http:/typophile.com/files/medwarsig_5481.jpg)\n\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [medwarsig.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811070235/http:/typophile.com/files/medwarsig.jpg) | 106.87 KB |\n\n [‹ children's theater](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811070235/http:/typophile.com/node/19722 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Victorian(?) style logo for small web/dtp business ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811070235/http:/typophile.com/node/19648 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I don’t understand the significance of the rz in merz but the rotation/reflection falls down because the r won’t let you do that. I don’t know if you could find a better typeface, but I suspect a simple monoline would perform better something like [Variable](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811070235/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/variable/). As it stands I am not getting any sturdy tradition, let alone nimbleness.  \nTim\n\n"
