  "content": "/ THE CHALLENGE\n\nFood is great. Fonts are great. Together they could be really really tasty. Craft the name of any food out of the food itself.\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May the best designer win.\n\n// REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Image size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi\\*  \n- Color: Black and White or color  \n- Format: JPG or PNG (make sure there are no spaces in the name)\n\n**\\*Please try to keep your file sizes to a minimum! 50k per file max.**\n\n// ABOUT TYPOPHILE [TYPE BATTLES](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127043440/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles)\n\nThis is your chance to stretch your type muscles on a weekly basis. You have one week to create and submit your entry. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nAs with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize — only the ability to call yourself the best on the block.\n\nLink directly to this battle: **[http://www.typophile.com/battle37](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127043440/http:/www.typophile.com/battle36)**  \nLink to the battle directory: [http://www.typophile.com/typebattles](http://web.archive.org/web/20150127043440/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles \"http://www.typophile.com/typebattles\")\n\n",
