  "content": "Grotext still needs some time. In the meantime have fun with Tiptoe Toy, our uppercase-only demo font. It includes four weights, and some Stylistic Set features to play with them. Free download at [http://www.kltf.de/tiptoetoy.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20141016053632/http:/www.kltf.de/tiptoetoy.htm \"http://www.kltf.de/tiptoetoy.htm\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141016053632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kltf_tiptoetoy_6282.gif)\n  \nKLTF decided to produce OpenType fonts only. However, alongside each full-featured OpenType font, there is a Basic version. This is OpenType too and covers the same CE accented letters as the full-featured version, but omits alternate glyph forms and OpenType features.\n\nThe full-featured Tiptoe family can be licensed at US$180, a single weight at US$60. The Tiptoe Basic family can be licensed at US$120, a single weight at US$40.\n\nThe full-featured Litteratra -- including italics, titling uppercase and a bunch of ligatures -- can be licensed at US$120. Litteratra Basic can be licensed at US$40.Read more about our typefaces or download manuals at [http://www.kltf.de/news.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20141016053632/http:/www.kltf.de/news.htm \"http://www.kltf.de/news.htm\")\n\nFull-featured versions can be licensed from Village at [http://vllg.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20141016053632/http:/vllg.com/ \"http://vllg.com\")\n\nType designers only: Visit our new little download area! It offers a few PDF documents like the updated OpenType Resources link collection, and some more or less useful FontLab Studio 5 scripts.
