  "content": "Hi people,  \nI was wondering if there is a website or book or guide of any kind that highlights specific details of a typeface which clearly identifies it. Such as... the leg of the capital R helps to identify Gill Sans, or whatever.  \nI feel like I'm slowly getting better at doing this, but a guide would great to have.\n\nThanks.  \nbrian\n\n",

Here is the interactive beta version of the [Sans Serif ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013173942/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php).\n\nIt has been brought up to date through the most recent FontShop FontBook (2006), but relatively few updates since then. Images are still missing for many of the newer fonts, and designer information is still missing in many cases. Jan has generously volunteered to help bring it up to date, and eventually it will replace the static Sans Guide now on my site.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "BTW Brian, the old book \"Rookledge's International Typefinder\" has a diagnostic visual key scheme to use attributes of letters to identify typefaces with those features. It's excellent, but it was published in 1983, so the typefaces are truly 'classic', and many have not made it into digital form. The collection of Serif fonts in my edition reaches 240 typefaces. I think these is a later edition of the book, but still with fewer than 300 serif families shown. There are only 50 Sans Serif families in the next section of the book, although more are found under Display headings.\n\nIdentifont does try to use a similar scheme allowing you to select attributes for a subset of letters, but I have found it very unreliable about using the information you give it, as if some of the algorithm code is messed up. Many times the selections are not even close to your choices.\n\nMy Serif and Sans Guides use a limited set of Key letters for you to select structural attributes, and tries to show you all the catalogued fonts that have those attributes for the letters you specified. You use the visual comparisons to pick the right font from the choices shown.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
