If someone tried to make this font more conventional, it would have been more like the sample.\n\nIt also reminds me of [Britannia](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032831/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atbritannia-bold/) in some ways.\n\nI am finding that the ability to search for ’semiserif’ or ’semisans’ is rather poor at the usual font sites.\n\nThe fact we have not found this yet means either that Angel is away from his computer, and/or this is from a pretty obscure source, possibly a freebie font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
