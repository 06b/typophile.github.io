The designer of this incarnation might have thought that this would look unique and nobody would connect it with Bernhard Bold Condensed. BTW, I don't know whether Lucien Bernhard was involved in making Bernhard Bold Condensed by Monotype Design Studio, aka Bernhard Antiqua Schmalfette, when published by Bauer Type Foundry.  \nDon\n\n"
