The new font is very modern but the image of the doctor looks dated.\n\nThe icon and the type are too disjointed items with no real relationship. A first obvious step would be to put Berkeley in the same color as the oval, however I think this may need a little more work than just that. Also on your second posting the colors are too close in tone/value. It’s fine to keep them in the same blue-green family but at first glance they look the same. Or perhaps it’s just my screen, on your earlier posting they had more contrast.\n\n"

This is the contrast between an organic form (the doctor) and the futuristic typeface.\n\nSee [http://www.berkeley.com.br/companyinfo/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081206012954/http:/www.berkeley.com.br/companyinfo/)\n\n"

Like circle?\n\nIf you’re goging to use a circle you may consider slanting your type for about 5° to make some dynamism. I think your type may be appropriate but I’d shorten extenders. Maybe not on the L, but definitely on Y.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

      "content": "The unicase/lower case mix of the new typeface is peculiar, some of the glyphs don’t appear to be designed to be together. The B sits well with the e and r but not with the K, l or y. I share the same misgivings about the “techno”-quality of the type, for the reasons that it is already dated by some standards and will not age well. The relationship between icon and type isn’t working yet, they just aren’t tied together whether this can be sorted is a tricky problem since you have two strong directions – horizontal and diagonal, this is especially evident in the centred versions. The next area to look at is the sub, you have a long line to work with and used at a small size (business card for example) it might be just too small to read easily, but as noted the lines in the icon will also need consideration if they aren’t going to fill in at small size – so, given that it cannot be altered, that minimum safe size is going to dictate, to some extent, the form of the logo.\n\nThe website has that web 2.0 emboss, highlight effect that some web designers feel free to throw at every carefully designed (or not) logo – not pertinent to your project, just something that really annoys me, especially when I am forced to comply with poorly constructed guidelines.\n\nI don’t see the sexism in the icon, it doesn’t seem to have a specific gender, maybe that’s just me.\n\nTim\n\n"

It is DEFINITELY sexist. Anyone who argues otherwise may not be worth working for.\n\n"

Careful design can be used to make an image like this truly gender-neutral, but in this case, it might still need a little bit of tweaking. If it solicited this strong of a reaction in me, it might do the same for others.\n\nIn any case, all I was saying that it was one other thing to consider besides the type.\n\n"

I don’t mind this typeface since you it does an effective job at making the point that this is a medical technology company, but there is that huge white space under that r, specifically in the first logo, that is just making my eye not want to look at it anymore.\n\nI think tying the oval doctor logo (which is also awful, but since you can’t change it I’ll skip my rant) in more with the Tagline or the company name would definitely give this logo a much tighter and precise looking quality. Maybe try something other than a completely linear looking logo, make the oval work for you, rather work for it.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
