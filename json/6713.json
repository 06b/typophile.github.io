It comes in 5 weights (the heavy is most like this) and many characters have 2 or 3 variations. It is all uppercase, but creating a lower case 'i' and a few smaller-size latters would be easy enough using a heavier weight (Mostra Black) at a smaller size. It is also based on type styles of the 20's and 30's.\n\n",
