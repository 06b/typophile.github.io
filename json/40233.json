  "content": "Hi all,\n\nHere’s an excerpt of a typeface which I can’t identify. Sometimes I think it’s a kind of Garamond, but the j’s are too different. Does anyone recognize this font?\n\nIt’s a scan from a Dutch translation of Dante’s Divine Comedy, by Primavera Pers, Leiden, published in three parts around 2000.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nMarcel\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [scan\\_dante.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071225133155/http:/typophile.com/files/scan_dante.gif) | 89.11 KB |\n\n [‹ \"design your board\" classic serif face](http://web.archive.org/web/20071225133155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40282 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [AdiHaus ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071225133155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40285 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
