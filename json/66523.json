Paste into the comment box.\n\nOh, you wanted something simpler?\n\nI prefer this system, as the easier ways result in over-quoting. People will tend to just quote the bits that are relevant. Worst case systems automatically quote everything, and after five or six messages you wind up with 100s of line of quotes message, and then get down to a one line answer.\n\n"

It's as good as we have right now.\n\nThere are pros and cons to a more automated, feature rich quotation system as already noted. I'm hesitant to go around requesting new features after the madness of the last upgrade (which has thankfully died down). I am partial to the way Fark.com handles the situation, though it requires vigilance on the part of the writer to keep it from getting muddled.\n\n"
