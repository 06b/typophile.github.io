  "content": "Hey guys,\n\nSo, somebody on Wikipedia has been fairly successfully propagating the label \"virtual typefaces\" for what I would call digital typefaces or digital fonts. That category has been getting applied to many typefaces, apparently the distinction being that they are \\*only\\* available in digital form, and were not phototype or metal typefaces.\n\nSo, two related questions:\n\n1) I might argue that every typeface that is available in digital form should also get the same label (whatever that label is). Agree or disagree?\n\n2) I think the label \"virtual typeface\" is silly. Nobody uses that term that I am aware of, except this one person. The actual link redirects to \"computer font.\" Some possible labels:\n\n- Computer typeface\n- Digital typeface\n- Virtual typeface\n\nFor the category label, \"font\" does not work so well because we are indeed talking about \"typefaces\" (the entire family).\n\nWhat do you prefer?\n\nPersonally, I prefer \"digital\" over \"computer\" because these fonts are used on many devices that are not thought of as computers, even if they do have computer chips inside them.\n\n",

A typeface is an individual design style, so that would be not an entire family but the individual roman, italic, bold, etc. designs. A font is a functional implementation of a typeface _or some part of a typeface_ for a given technology. Hence, a font of metal foundry type would be a tray of sorts in a particular style/weight combination, its functionality determined by the set of languages it can cover. So a single typeface, e.g. Fubar Roman, might be spread across multiple fonts if it happened to support more characters than a single composing tray could hold and had extensions for 'exotics'. You are right that a font, in the context of metal type, would be a specific size, but it is a specific size of a specific style design: a font is not a specific size of an entire family. A family is either a typeface family or a font family, depending whether you are talking about a set of related designs or a collection of fonts.\n\nWhat I like about this use of the terminology is that it is technologically independent. The notion of a typeface as described and the notion of a font map neatly to various typesetting technologies and attendant font formats, even though the referants for the word 'font' change and the elements of a typeface that can be captured by an individual font varies for different technologies.\n\n"

Scotch Modern. Even though this is a digital revival, it is not a virtual typeface, because the outlines do not look like metal type—rather they look like typography done with metal type, including the artefact of press gain. So, although the fonts are not virtual, they can be used to create virtual facsimiles of old letterpress documents. The distinction is between type and typography, which this “virtual is a digital revival” concept does not address. ITC Bodoni, virtual; digital Bauer Bodoni, certainly not.\n\n2. Handsome Pro. An original design, and hence not “virtual”? Surely, if any category of digital fonts deserves to be termed virtual, it is those OpenType scripts, with ligatures and ﬂourishes, the express purpose of which is to imitate handwriting and/or hand lettering.\n\n3. Brown Gothic. As an original design, this would not be considered a virtual font or typeface. Nonetheless, it has been designed speciﬁcally to imitate, when printed by offset lithography, the effect of letterpress printing. I would say that’s highly virtual.\n\n"

Unless one makes a digital outline font that can only function at one size, (a bitmap is a virtual font), all others are virtual typefaces. Typefaces before, were a font style at all available sizes. Typeface families before, were several font styles at all available sizes.\n\nTypefaces now are a style able to represent all font sizes, (a virtual typeface).  \nTypefaces families now are one digital file, that can generate all the styles and sizes of those styles, like a superpolator file, (a virtual typeface family), or a group of typeface styles, coming in all sizes, like a normal family of otfs, (and a family of virtual typefaces).\n\nSimple as pi.\n\nHrant: \"..the worst genocide in history was carried out by a democratic country... \"\n\nYou need a history lesson. Between 70 and 90% of the native population of north and south america was destroyed by deceases brought to the western hemisphere by monarchy-funded voyages of discovery, before 1783.\n\n"

The democratic United States carried out a program of mass extermination to establish a more expansive country. They only stopped because they hit the Pacific. You need to fess up, individually, as a people and as a country. Most of the world knows that, but everybody has their own causes to fight.\n\nAnd please answer my question, so people don't have to wonder why you left out Armenians (who lost the most) and how you think the organizers of ISType having to warn the speakers not to bring up the Armenian Genocide qualifies as \"cleaning up the mess\".\n\nhhp\n\n"
