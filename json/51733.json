With the furtive patach, you can encode it (if people actually want it is another question), but I still don’t see how you are going to even encode the kamatz katan. Even with our siddur we have made editorial decisions as to what is a kamatz katan or not based on various sources and changed our minds. How are you going to allow a person what to do?</cite>\n\nI always cite the easy example of the Hebrew word for afternoon which the first kamatz is katan according to sefardim and gadol according to ashkenazim (and that’s an easy one). You have yet to address this problem.\n\ngohebrew: <cite>I would make all the different forms of kamataz katan. People can chose which glyph they want.</cite>\n\nChocalate for chocalate lovers; vanilla for vanilla lovers; and even strawberry for those daring type.\n\nIf a GSUB routine can be written whereby ordinary kamatzes will be selectively replaced with one form of kataz katan, then so it shall be.\n\nI then make three nearly identical versions of the font, each with a different default. If you pay extra, you get chocalate. If you pay extra, you get vanilla.\n\nAbout kamatz katan for Ashkenazim, I was told by Israel-based kollel Hemdat HaAretz (the halachic decider for the OU) that even for them it is an issue, just not in recognizable pronunciation.\n\nI think they mean on how it impacts the shva-na.\n\n"

The problem with the rafe is that it gets in the way of taamey mikra.\n\nMaking the shva larger is pretty ugly, however it became popular after making the kamatz katan larger too. It works graphically much better than a football or an asterisk.\n\nIf there are no taamim, then a rafe also works graphically because a horizontal line fits with the letters (eg a patach).\n\nRegarding the meteg. There is no meteg in nikud. However, traditionally just as Artscroll \"incorrectly\" use a rafe to indicate a shva na, the meteg was used \"incorrectly\" to indicate a mileil.\n\nIt's like Rinat Yisrael who use an ole to indicate a mileil on commonly mispronounced words or a zarka for milra. It doesn't turn the taamim into nikud!\n\nAlso you don't address the bizarre vertical placement of the taamim.\n\n"

Did Chabad copyright the asterisk?\n\n<cite>So, in conclusion, ArtScroll’s rafe symbol is illogical while Kehot’s asterisk symbol is not.</cite>\n\nHey, I got 100% in logic at University and I'm completely failing to see the logic of yours. Both symbols have other purposes. The asterisk is probably more well-known than that of the rafe. Also the rafe is actually a taam whereas the asterisk has no basis in Bible typography. I think according to that logic, the rafe is far superior choice than that of an asterisk. But that's just my logic.\n\n<cite>In my view as a professional graphic artist, there is nothing wrong with the current depiction of the kamatz katan.</cite>\n\nThank G-d. I will inform typesetters all over the world that we have Scott's approval on the symbol that has been used now in hundreds of thousands of siddur world-wide for over 50 years. People will be so relieved.\n\n<cite>Regarding the meteg’s widespread usage in non-taamim text, “go fight city hall” if you think that it will change. It ain’t gonna happen.</cite>\n\nHuh? What are you talking about. I have no objection to the meteg being used at all. I had it added to the new Koren Siddur that I produced. I think it's an excellent way of indicated mileil. Why would I \"fight city hall\".\n\nI just pointed out that it isn't a nikud. The same way that the zarka and ole that is used by Rinat Yisrael are not nikud either. They are taamey mikra. They are used \"incorrectly\" in both instances, but who cares. They solve a problem very nicely.\n\n"

So you spend 100s of hours researching it (you must have spent that easily on these forums), you spend 100s if not 1000s of hours programming into a font.\n\nNow tell me, after all that R&D how much you going to sell the font for? $50? $5,000? Just curious to know if you've thought this through to the business side. I certainly wouln't spend all that money on a typeface. It would cheaper for me to hire a proofreader...\n\n"

If I thought only practical 'bout things, like money, I'd be in California some place, with more money to \"piss off\", and a few girl friends to... um.... hmmm.\n\nBut at age 22 or 23, I changed, and became a Chabadnik.\n\nI gave up a scholarship at Spertus College (they thought I'd be the next Elie Wiesel), a gifted sports car, and a stipend to go out with girls every week. Plus I'd be invited for Shabbat every week by a dozen Conservatives. All they wanted in return to stay from those \"stinky Lubavs\".\n\nPretty good deal, huh?\n\nBut, I must have been really dumb. I picked those \"stinky Lubavs\". I ended going to yeshiva for years, getting married, having 8 kids, and the grandkids keep popping out...\n\nI learned type design after a rav told me to stay away from safrut (because of my being left-handed, with strength in my right).\n\nNow, I graduated to master OpenType thanks to Diane Collier and John Hudson. With a little more help from my friends (Rabbi Rabin, Prof. Dotan, David Hanuel, and others), I'll get this shvana, kamatz katan, meteg stuff mastered too (G-d made these things to figure out and master)...\n\nMoney is not my motivation.\n\nA person needs money to live. But living is not for money. It's only to make a living.\n\nMy goal is restore Jewish understanding of this grammar stuff to where it was before there were maskilim, and Jewish people began to lose knowledge of it, like today when 99.9% don't know the grammar of their own language.\n\nI will spend less than a 1,000 hours researching it, and less than a hundred hours programming it. OpenType/Volt is brain intersive, not heavy in time consumtion - that's why I think you made a big mistake picking Tvika.)\n\nMy goal anyway is to earn money not from this mainly, but from other ventures, as seen as [www.gotalmud.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414042737/http:/www.gotalmud.org/ \"www.gotalmud.org\") and [www.gohebrew.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414042737/http:/www.gohebrew.com/ \"www.gohebrew.com\").\n\n<cite>[Btw, \"harbs\" disappointed me a great deal. You made him out to be really great, but he seems at best run of the mill - I would not buy anything from PrintIsrael. I see that <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150414042737/http:/www.fontworld.com/\" title=\"www.fontworld.com\">www.fontworld.com</a> is a much better source.

I have my own programmer for the programming.\n\nRe Harbs. Sorry it didn't work out for you. He has been absolutely invaluable to my work and has given hundreds of hours of help to me as well as the few scripts that I've commissioned from him to make our Siddur and Tanakh projects work. He has come through for me time and time again.\n\nRe Fontworld. Great. I'm glad you have a source that works for you.\n\nRe Kesofsky. Thanks for the compliment. May I ask who he is?\n\n"

Despite the fact that they were using a siddur which had a shva na and a meteg (I'm ignoring the kamatz katan because this crowd didn't do Israeli pronunciation), the ba'aley tfilla who were a combination of prominent Rabbis and Chazanim still managed to mispronounce every word. Even the ba'al koreh was awful and not a single person corrected him.\n\nAll the siddurim put in a meteg, Artscroll has a very prominent line and some siddurim have footballs, yet nobody notices. I just wonder if literally millions of siddurim mark this already (some for over 100 years) but this has had no impact on the supposedly knowledgeable public...\n\n"

      "content": "Just out of curiousity, Raphael, how were they \"mispronouncing\" the prayers? I put that in quotes because according to the essay by William Chomsky on the shva that came up in these discussions, it is very questionable whether the \"correct pronunciation\" was ever correct. He says that historically the current views on the correct places to pronounce the shva have their origin in the views of David Kimchi, also known as RaDaK. But if I read him rightly--and I am a novice at this--these were conjectural attempts to make sense of the Tiberian system of nikkud, and are of doubtful value.\n\nHe says that within living memory both Ashkenazi and Sfaradi speakers of Hebrew have followed much simpler spoken rules. These have been: 1. Pronounce a shva if it is under a prepositional prefix or a conjunctive vav. 2. Pronounce it if it is under the first letter, and the first letter is a 'liquid consonant'--yod, mem, nun, lamed, and resh. 3. It is the second of two successive shvas. (I suppose the rule about two successive letters, eg hallelujah, applies also.)\n\nSo, for example in k'tana and g'dola (little and big, feminine) the shva at the beginning is a shva nach, contrary to the 'right' rules which say that it is sounded.\n\nSo if ignoring the supposed 'right' rules for the shva na is all they are doing 'wrong' my feeling is: \"if this is wrong, I don't wanna be right\", to paraphrase a country song.\n\n"
