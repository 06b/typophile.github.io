I know that some of the letters such as the 'R' in Washburn have been altered. I am wondering if this font was specially designed for the logo? I can't find it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [washburn-logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822193540/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-2_33.jpg) | 126.82 KB |\n| [university-closeup.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822193540/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_113.jpg) | 78.47 KB |\n\n",
