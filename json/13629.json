Spiekermann founded [MetaDesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/MetaDesign) in 1979 and designed its namesake typeface [FF Meta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FF%20Meta). In 1989 he, [Neville Brody](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Neville%20Brody), and [Joan Spiekermann](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Joan%20Spiekermann) started [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont). This was preceded by the formation of font retailer [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop). Most recently, Spiekermann founded [United Designers Network](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/United%20Designers%20Network) with offices in Berlin, London and San Francisco. In January 2007, the studio has been renamed SpiekermannPartners.\n\nSpiekermann splits his time between his homes in Berlin, London and San Francisco. He often travels to various speaking engagements and to jury type and graphic design competitions. For a decade Erik helped organize TypoBerlin, the annual FontShop sponsored conference in Berlin.\n\nSpiekermann's most prolific typefaces are [ITC Officina Sans and Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ITC%20Officina%20Sans%20and%20Serif), [FF Meta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FF%20Meta) and [FF Unit](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FF%20Unit).\n\nSpiekermann's highest profile clients are Nokia, Audi, the city of Berlin, and _The Economist_. The system of typefaces he designed with [Christian Schwartz](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Christian%20Schwartz) for DB Deutsche Bahn (the German Railways) won the German Federal Design Prize for 2007, the most prestigious award in Germany.\n\nURLs:  \n [http://www.spiekermann.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/www.spiekermann.com/ \"http://www.spiekermann.com\") - his personal blog  \n [http://www.spiekermannpartners.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/www.spiekermannpartners.com/ \"http://www.spiekermannpartners.com\") - his Berlin and San Francisco-based design studios  \n [http://www.fontshop.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/www.fontshop.com/ \"http://www.fontshop.com\") - the font retail operation he co-founded  \n [http://www.fontfont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/www.fontfont.com/ \"http://www.fontfont.com\") - the type foundry he co-founded  \n [http://www.fstopimages.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/www.fstopimages.com/ \"http://www.fstopimages.com\") - the stock image library started by FSI in 2002  \n [Postage stamps designed by Erik Spiekermann](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/www.katranpress.com/stamps_spiekermann_1_1.html)\n\n**Additional Articles:**  \n\" [Erik Spiekermann - typography and design today](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/pingmag.jp/2005/10/31/erik-spiekermann-typography-and-design-today/)\", _[PingMag](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042346/http:/typophile.com/wiki/PingMag)_\n\n[This is a stub entry.
