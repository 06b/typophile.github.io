It’s a face with some style but not over-the-top, either.\n\nRayne...the catch is your throwing out some rather vague adjectives. The main contradiction is ’professional typeface’ and ’free’. Combining those two together severely limits your options list.\n\nThat said, Jos has gifted some wonderful free typefaces to the world that I think would match your criteria:\n\n[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905123327/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/ \"http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/\")\n\n"
