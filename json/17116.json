With a bit of clipping of Nick’s G, I think you’d have it.\n\nBottom line: Carolina Golf could be a customized mix of these two fonts.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Even better than knowing how to fake a font, is knowing where the actual font can be found.\n\n_There must be a principle like Ockham’s Razor when it comes to fonts too — the simplest explanation is almost always the right one._\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
