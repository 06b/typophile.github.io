Forget legibility etc. What I want to dicuss is type that has another function besides the presentation of letters and words. Think: Manhole covers, the type gives the name of the manufacturer and perhaps the city, but it must also create grip for the soles of shoes. Braille (probably spelt wrong) must be legible to the hand not the eye.   \n   \nWhat I need help with is coming up with more examples...so post away.   \n   \nThanks.   \n   \nP.S.

Until we computerized Ethiopic, the alphabet was printed manually or in the printing presses. Starting in 1982 we have taken the beautiful Ethiopic through DOS (ModEth, 1988) and Windows 3.0, 3.1 and 95. We have continued to develop applications for communicating with Ethiopic scripts via e-mail and the Internet since 1994. Our Ethiopic scripts contain the 480+ characters and require a maximum of two keystrokes to type each character. Our clients have started enjoying Ethiopic HTML (and HDML) on the information superhighway. Our sites are under continuous construction and the pages will have many language alphabets. Currently most of our Ethiopic web pages are in English and Amharic (Aírµ) languages. We expect to see documents in many of the languages of this historic African region in the near future. As of January 1997, Ethiopia has obtained limited access to the Internet and this has enabled Ethiopians to see our multi-lingual site for the first time. However, the use of Ethionet requires prior publication of Ethiopic documents using our software.   \n   \nThese pages are also dedicated to Ethiopic and the technology we have been developing and standardizing for it. You will find some free software or links to software for use with Geez documents. We will have many links to Ethiopic and Ethiopia related references, news, lessons, products, advertisements, organizations, entertainment, etc. in Amharic and English. This is the multi-lingual Ethiopic information superhighway at its infancy.   \n   \nOur products are protected through pending patent, copyright, trade secrets, etc. We have also submitted patent application to the Ethiopian government though there was no patent protection in Ethiopia. (In spite of these, our fears have come true by the proliferation of copycats to plagiarize our products. Beware of copycats who would try to peddle incomplete character sets and macros as Ethiopic software. None of the copycats can type the Ethiopic characters using two keystrokes or less per character or post Ethiopic documents on the Internet.

We have never been famous for our designs, unlike the Netherlands, and I think it boils down to people becoming too safe in their offices sitting in front of their computers. I want them to read about design and not be overwhelmed by the technicalities (such as ledding and EMs). I would like them to perhaps look at design from a slighty different angle than they normally would.
