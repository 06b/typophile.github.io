Hitler, who had a preference for classic Roman imperial inscriptional letters, was one of the chief exponents of this style of type, which became explicitly identified with Nazi ideas of [German nationalism](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145101/http:/typophile.com/wiki/German%20nationalism). The names of the typefaces -- [Deutschland](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145101/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Deutschland), National, [Tannenberg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145101/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Tannenberg) -- reveal this connection. Schaftstiefelgrotesks bear the same relationship to traditional German blackletters that [grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145101/http:/typophile.com/wiki/grotesque) [sans serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145101/http:/typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif) types do to traditional serifed Latin type: they are simplified, weighted versions of the forms, sturdier and less refined. The name, given to the style by typesetters, is ironic. Of all the types sullied by association with the Nazis, they are the most problematic.\n\n",
