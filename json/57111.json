  "content": "I have used class kerning before, but just ran into a problem I had not encountered before.\n\nAll my previous classes were simple with both sides being the same. I watched a video on class kerning this evening and he explained also how to do class kerning on one side only.  \n [http://www.vimeo.com/681300?pg=embed&sec=681300](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203075111/http:/www.vimeo.com/681300?pg=embed&sec=681300 \"http://www.vimeo.com/681300?pg=embed&sec=681300\")\n\nIn this family of typefaces that I'm working on I had a handful of alternate letters and some ligatures that I had under the dlig feature. Previous to this I had not generated a kern feature since I knew I would be adding more classes.\n\nAnyway… when I generated the kern feature on the first font with the new one-side-only kerning classes and then compiled it in the OT panel I got a whole list of warnings.\n\nSample:  \n[WARNING] Start of new pair positioning subtable; some pairs may never be accessed: [A Adieresis Aring Agrave Atilde Acircumflex Aacute A.alt Amacron Abreve Aogonek] [T T\\_H T\\_H\\_E T\\_T T\\_T\\_Y T\\_U T\\_V T\\_W T\\_Y]\n\nIt still compiles and the kerning seems to work as it should in the metrics window. When I deleted the new classes, deleted the kern feature and regenerated it without the new classes it was fine. Anybody know what's going on with that?\n\nHere is a sample of a left-side only kerning class:  \n\\_Tleftside: T' T\\_H T\\_H\\_E T\\_T T\\_T\\_Y T\\_U T\\_V T\\_W T\\_Y  \nI then checked the box to the right side.\n\nStephen\n\n",

It seems like that might be a natural thing, but maybe I'm just not getting it. For instance, I have a class for T that includes all the accented T's. Then I have 2 classes for T that each have glyphs (ligatures} that have T on either end. Does that cause what you're referring to?\n\n"

It might be worth copy/pasting those classes into text edit and looking at them blown up. I sometimes miss syntax problems in my classes because I have a hard time reading the tiny text in the class window.\n\n"
