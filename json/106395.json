Your eyes have to move at a frantic pace from left to right to read. The letters in Dotsies words smoosh together, so words look like shapes! Get more screen space! Save paper. Have a more comfortable reading experience_ (Muth, C. 2012).”  \n————  \nThoughts?\n\n",

Also, can you imagine checking a dotsies text for grammar?\n\nIn the sample on the dotsies page going from text to dotsies, I have a lot of problems reading beyond the 4th line. Who said being more economical with space helps readability anyway?\n\n\"It's easier than you think. There are only 26 letters. Numbers and punctuation aren't altered. You've probably learned more than 26 things in a single hour-long class or lecture.\"\n\nI don't think the issue is the amount of letters or even our memory capacity necessarily, but rather the fact that it's very hard to distinguish letters from each other. This is a lot of fun for people with dyslexia I can imagine.\n\nRussell, your typeface looks half Asian. I like it. It's hard to read but it looks cool. Is this font available by any chance?\n\n"
