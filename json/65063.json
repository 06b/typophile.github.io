That’s their profession, but not their hobby. They want to be payed for their work; and the development of high-class fonts is very much work. The problem is not mainly a poor student, that uses an unlicensed font for his private purposes, but people, that earn money with projects, for which they have used unlicensed fonts. Unfortunately many of these type designers compare the passing on of font files with the theft of material things, which is not really a plausible explanation for people like you, because a Porsche cannot be copied in milliseconds.\n\n"

Shouldn’t it be called \"All I want to be, is being good\"?\n\n"
