  "content": "Hallo,  \nwe are looking for some passionated typographers. Next year we will offer walks in the ruhr area in Germany. During these walks you can learn something about typography. We have taken lots of photos and now we need lots of information about the fonts on our photos. Of course, we are both interested in the name of the font and in little stories around it.  \nJust visit our flickr-group “Route Schriftkultur“ and note information under our photos. We will change the photos when we have enough information because we have more photos than we can show on flickr.  \nThank you very much!  \n [http://www.flickr.com/groups/1239436@N24/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014222015/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/1239436@N24/ \"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1239436@N24/\")\n\n",
