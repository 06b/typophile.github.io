So is the -5-, but I think it is because you need to extend the bottom exit stroke by one pixel. The -A- seems a hair too tricky. The -f- seems too short.\n\nCan you show us another setting of the entire set spaced out a bit more?\n\n"

You were absolutely right about the swashy 'W'; it's much better now. As for the 's', the alternatives aren't any better, are they? And is that what you had in mind for the '5'? Because I don't think it works. So doesn't the longer 'f'. Now, what do you mean by <cite>The -A- seems a hair too tricky</cite>? As for the spacing, it's either that loose or dense as it was before; I'm not sure which one is preferable. What do you say?\n\nMany thanks,  \nOri\n\n"
