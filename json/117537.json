      "content": "One technique for making this type of letter was to print a large scale alphabet of a suitable base font -- perhaps in this case Helvetica Ultra Compressed, as suggested by Ryuk -- use a paper cutter or scissors to cut the letters at about 45 degrees into sections, and reassemble the sections to make new shorter letters with the jagged outlines.  \nIIRC this was the technique used as part of the process to make the famous RKO Thunderbolt Letters\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110520im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RKOsm_4310.jpg)\n This alphabet would be even more difficult to make into a font than the DRUGS lettering.  \nThe RKO base letters were probably hand lettered, but I wonder what fonts might have similarities to the letters before they were cut.  \nDon \n"
