  "content": "My latest type design and first MyFonts release is called Raniscript. The name was inspired by some images of vintage matchbook designs advertising the Flying Rani. Raniscript is based on a ronde style script, but with some contemporary touches. It comes fully loaded with contextual alternates, swashes, case sensitive punctuation, and a set of caps that are designed for caps only settings.\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/raniscript/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140424140859/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/raniscript/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/raniscript/\")\n\nStephen\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140424140859im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Raniscript_1_4312.png)\n\n",
