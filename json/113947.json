      "content": "Thanks Fivos for the pointer to Legrand. I found the Rick Mueller and \"Font Shop 1999\" digitizations at \"free\" sites as well as a pointer to a digitization by Gerald Gallo being sold under the name Display Art Three [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gallofonts/display-art-three/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317115909/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/gallofonts/display-art-three/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gallofonts/display-art-three/\") Identifont and the major font vendors are blank for Legrand.  \nThey seem to be independent digitizations of the same source. The Gallo version has a slightly more finished quality than the Mueller, but has far fewer glyphs. The Fontshop 1999 is of poorer quality.  \nDon\n\n"
