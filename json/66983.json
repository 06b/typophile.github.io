  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am turning to you all as my typophile saviors on this one. A former employee created an address sign's artwork (for our studio). As the years have gone by, files were lost, fonts deleted. Time has come to remake it.\n\nAny thoughts on what this might be? The \"1\" is similar to Century Gothic Bold, but the 2 differs to some degree.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016103556im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Chadwick_addressSign_sm_6143.jpg)\n\nANY help would be great!!!\n\nBest  \nDaniel\n\n",
