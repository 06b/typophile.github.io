They are very upset and I can understand why. The office that design the \"Hippie\" logo say that there are too many typefaces like the one used in the \"RollingStone\" logo and that the complain has not a solid base.   \n   \nIn Chile the author rights for a designer doesn't exist, the lawyers don't recognize the graphic and typoface design as a field where the laws can be applied, so I am hoping that this could be a very good start point to eliminate the graphic design copycats, here thay are a plague and I really think that designers won't evolve until we realize that originality is an important fact in a good design.   \n   \nI have always love the typographic work in RollingStone Magazine, and I always think that their logo is a customize font.   \n   \nSo, can anyone tell me if I am wrong, and what do you think about the similitud.   \n   \n ![RollingStone v/s Hippie](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419092229im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/24681.gif)   \n   \n   \nFor me the \"Hippie\" logo is a very bad copy, the curves in the horizontal stem in the \"H\" are more natural for an \"R\", the \"e\" and \"i\" are identicals, and the \"Hp\" ligature is a bad varsion of the \"Rl\" in \"RoollinStone\" and owfully consturcted, its funny that the bad construction is evident just where they can't get an exact copy.   \n   \nI need the experts opinion, and I will do all I can to publish our final typophiles veredict in the same newspaper where I read the article, that by the way is the most important in Chile.   \n   \nThanks for all the opinions, and don't get too upset with the copycats plague.   \n   \nCG\n\n",

And that was more fun and fulfilling than just getting it set plain. Today, types like Perla and Dalliance offer the same opportunity.   \n   \n\\>Yes, it's sloppy, both in concept and execution, but it's parody.   \n   \nSorry Kevin, I must disagree with you. The knock-off's execution is pretty slick. Maybe some of the curves could be a bit smoother, but the \"dimensionalization\" is a quite accurate copy, as are many of the letter forms.   \n   \nPlease don't dignify such wholesale theft as \"parody\" -- real parody is either mocking, or a travesty. This rip-off is much too close to the original to be either: it adds nothing.   \n   \nAnd that's when the purpose of parody is art, which is perhaps justifiable.

From the representation that shows up on my screen, I don't see the result as craftless or sloppy; simply a bit lacking in gestalt. The H seems to be arguing with itself, and the two p's dont carry the same entry stroke as the i. Why was the serif dropped on the top of the right stem on the H? At first glance the piece doesn't look all that bad. However, why bother with at best a tribute to RS, or at worst, a weak immitation of the master, Jim Parkinson.   \n   \nEven though I am much wrapped up in my own irrelevant world of lead and ink, and don't chase graphic design work much these days, \"Hippie\" is something I would have loved to take a whack at. Some people are incureable.   \n   \nSome years back I had a studio space in Vancouver's Gastown area (one of those nice old 1890's flat-iron buildings. In those days (late sixties) every lettering artist in town was trying to ape what was coming out of San Francisco, and I was one of them. There was a lot of work of that nature, and of course there was a lot of poster work as well. Reminiscing is bad for a person!   \n   \nPlagarism depends on what the borrower's motives are. If one wishes to quietly lift something and pass it off as their own; that stinks. It's understandable that a piece of work so knocks a person out that they wished that they had done it. I have always felt that way about Bix Beiderbecke's (someone for you to research if you are curious enough) musical ideas. For years and years, I tried to play his solos note for note, but I never sounded like anything other than myself, trying to play Bix's stuff.   \nWhat made Bix great is the same thing that makes Jim Parkinson great; some inner thing that is just there, and unexplainable. In short, natural talent. That's what makes a master.   \n   \nWhat I'm saying is, what I have always told my typography students: look at it, learn from it, and then go and have some fun with your OWN ideas. Good or bad, they are your own.   \n   \nThis has gotten as long as War and Peace. Sorry.   \n   \nJim Rimmer\n\n"

Original logo was just a sketch by Rick Griffin. I think he made $75. The logo was later refined by John Pistelli (Pistelli Roman). When I first started sketching on the logo, I ran right off the road and into a ditch. My drawings were too hippy-dippy...practically unreadable. I was trying to honor the work of Griffin, but got lost somewhere. I turned my attention to another RS project. A type family. Roger Black wanted the typefaces to be based on ATF Jenson...or the Golden Types. I was, at that time, very uneducated about type and my work was still heavily influenced by Griffin. The result was a series of typefaces I have described as Nicholas Jenson on acid. Some years later, The Font Bureau invited me to make changes I always wanted to make...and add a few faces. Those types are at the FB, now known as Parkinson. Anyhow, after the type was taking shape, Roger suggested I try making the logo from those designs. The result was my first RS logo. The 10th Anniversary version. A few years later, Jann Wenner asked me to try and bring back some of the feel of the original logo. I've heard that Mick Jagger made some comment to Jann that the 10th Anniversary logo appeared to have \"lost its balls.\" The result was the logo they use today. The intricated inline, outline arrangement was inspire by the Griffin logo but formalized, thanks to some ornate wood type samples and some herb. Regarding the Hippie logo...there have been dozens of knockoffs. I just wish they expanded on an idea..pushed it a bit further. Any questions?\n\n"

I would also have made the top (serif) angle on the i less severe and conformed the tops of the pp to the new tops on the i. Also, straighten crossbar on the H and put serif feet on any vertical stroke of the H that isn't swashed.   \n   \nBlah, blah, blah....\n\n"

Jim was an inspiration to me.   \n   \nAbout parody.   \nI guess it depends on who you are. The Swatch rip off done by Paula Scher [pg 448, History of Graphic Design; Meegs 3rd edition] becomes paying homage, according to Messrs. Heller and Meegs. Yet when someone emulates a style or really parodies it can be called rip off.   \n   \nFossil, for example, is designing in a style and is not just lifting elements and placing them in a new context. Yet some have said that they are just appropriating.   \n   \nSo when a designer works on a typeface that is based on the original work of a \"classic\" how would you catagorize that? Like Filosophia or Mrs eaves by Zuzana Licko.   \n   \n   \nNick thank you for your insights and the marijuana review, gawd I remember that.\n\n"

I guess I was too lazy to get out my copy of the Meggs book and do the right thing.   \n   \nThe argument of parody vs thievery could easily seem to be one of status. \"Real\" designers \"pay homage\" while \"fake\" designers \"rip off.\" I don't believe in this mantra. I think that it is truly about concept and knowledge. Zuzana sees Baskerville as an opportunity for typographic improvement (and does it all justice), whereas Microsoft sees Helvetica as too expensive and comes up with Arial. Hippie steals a style, totally ignorant to the history and real connotations.   \n   \nI guess it gets stickiest with CSA and Duffy with their retro thing. I suppose its never been a crime to revive or reference style, but it certainly doesn't further design and culture.   \n   \nAnyway, its a classic argument, one that has been fought out by the best of us to no end.   \n   \nAaron\n\n"

That may be one reason she has added \"gimmicks\" to Filsofia (the unicase) and Mrs Eaves (the crazy ligs, the 2 sets of SC). I'd like to see her do a traditional serifed face from scratch.

Aren't there too many people doing that already? She should use her inventiveness, just channel it better. Modula for example is a superb design, but with a hamartia: the overly literal lc \"g\" that makes the font not a text face. She should make a Modula-2 (huh, like the programming language!) with that (and the spacing) fixed.   \n   \nOr maybe I'm getting your \"traditional\" wrong.

      "content": "Everyone,   \nOn the second hand, our discussion is about the look of Hippie and how it \"pays hommage\" to Jim Parkinson's word mark for Rolling Stone. [tongue firmly in cheek here]   \n   \nHippie is poor lettering, and not well balanced.   \n   \nWhat we need to define here is \"paying hommage\" or diluting or \"ripping off\".   \n   \nIn my humble opinion, using a style as inspiration is paying hommage. But when we talk about taking or appropriating images from the past and reusing them in a different context or using them to lend validity or historicisim for a product should that be called \"rip off\"?   \n   \nLicko said she was paying hommage with her \"classics\" inspite of the gimmicks by the dutch guys (was it Erik or Just? who did the ligature programming). Scher said nothing at the time (it was done ex-post facto).   \n   \nSo maybe we can define these differences as whether the designer actually says that they are paying hommage or state where they get their inspiration; many type designers are going back in time to get inspiration, or to do revivalist work.   \n   \nI realize that there is no \"answer\" to this, but like language we can come up with consensus.   \n   \nMaybe that is the direction we could take on this.   \nPS.\n\n"

If it is for 20-somethings (and non-historians) perhaps it is better to use the Parkinson design as opposed to the original.
