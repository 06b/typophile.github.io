      "content": "First, I would not call this a script, but a serif font.\n\nI think this is custom. The style mixes some Latin (triangular) serifs with ruled or slab serifs. The most similar font I found was Castle Type's [Vincenzo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001459/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/vincenzo/). It has similar serifs, although the middle arm of the E is too long. The necessary changes could be made by flattening the letters and adjusting the center arm of the E.\n\nThen the three dimensional effects would have to be done with layering.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
