  "content": "Hi, i created a font for a guy in spain and he's having trouble using it in photoshop. The letters with accents don't show up, everything else does. He uses a spanish windows platform and the font is a ttf. He also has a friend who uses the same windows and the same photoshop and it works for the friend. I don't know which version of photoshop the guy(and his friend) have, sorry. Can anyone give me any help at all on what might be the problem (even if it's refering to another post i missed). thanks ahead of time.   \n-phillip cavette\n\n",
