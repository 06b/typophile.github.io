  "content": "I recently finished a font I have been working on for some time as I had to find a way of combining characters as ligatures. When I found VOLT I was excited. I finished the process of making ligatures and shipped the font. I then Installed it and tried it on Word 2007.\n\nThe Ligatures don't work. None what so ever. Is there a reason for this? Does Word not support the ligatures made with VOLT?\n\nThe font was created using Font Creator 5.6 if that makes a difference.\n\nIs there anything I can do, maybe a program or add-in I can download to resolve this issue?\n\nThank you.\n\n",
