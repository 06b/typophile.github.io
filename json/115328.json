That would _really_ save ink, and it would be a form of the One True Typeface!\n\nEDIT: Oh, silly me. I forgot Venetian 301, which is like Centaur, which is also considered a Jenson of sorts. And unlike Morris' Golden Type and its imitators, it is fairly light as well, so it is another alternative.\n\n"
