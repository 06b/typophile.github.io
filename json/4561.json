I personally like just the area of the head being green, because that is what makes people identify ducks/mallards. It may not be balanced, but I think it still works.

I didn't comment when I first saw your design, because nothing immediately stood out for critique and I'm too lazy to just type \"well done\". Anyway, it seems at this point that one of the biggest issues with the design is the proportions of the duck. Interestingly, if you return to your initial post, the proportions are pretty accurate, while in your last post your proportions have created a baby duck (small underdeveloped wings and an oversized head). Also, although the smoother head is more beautiful, it reminds me more of a swan direction than the original mallard head. The first head seems to represent a more agressive, dynamic and proactive business (in flight). I will say, however, that your second approach to the tail is an improvement. I am glad that nobody has suggested a type alternative, because that's a really good selection\n\n"

My interpretation of the duck comes from a combination of images that I studied before I began the project.   \n   \nHowever, I know it isn't realistic, but I didn't want it to be. I didn't want the gesture to be too bold. I wanted to make it simplistic and soft. I have seen some really good duck logos that are bold and more gestural that look more like the pics provided above. I just wanted to go in a different direction.   \n   \nIn relation to keeping the duck apart from the type, the client wants the logo to be able to work with the type. On the signage they will have to be used closely together. I really feel the changes above solves the issue of the icon working-with-the-type. I think the duck was just too close to the el's.\n\n"
