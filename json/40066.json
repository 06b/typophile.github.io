PDF  \n entries will be printed out by the TDC prior to the judging.  \n The server can be also used to register entries and print labels for  \n mailed or shipped entries.\n\nFull Call guidelines and procedures for the TDC2 2008 Type Design  \n Competition are at:  \n [http://www.tdc.org/calls/tdc22008/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080214092753/http:/www.tdc.org/calls/tdc22008/index.html \"http://www.tdc.org/calls/tdc22008/index.html\")\n\nAs well, the online registration facility is available to entrants to  \nTDC54 Typography, the TDC’s annual competition for excellence in  \ntypography, though the upload function is not available.
