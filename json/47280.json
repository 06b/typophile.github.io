That also explains why the Font Author was shown as 'unknown'. Please don't use fonts like that.

It was found on an old record cover that I stumbled over on the Internet. It had only the letters \"The Fabulous 50s\". The rest was up to my imagination.Some worked out OK some are not that good, like Å.Ä.Ö as you can see.\"  \nso perhaps the font you've been looking at is an illegal one eh Mike??\n\n"
