It’s different from other competitions because it:\n\n• focuses exclusively on Chicago designers,\n\n• signifies winners as leaders among Chicago designers,\n\n• promotes winners to Chicago’s design community,\n\n• promotes winners to Chicago’s business community,\n\n• and - most importantly - places winners in the Chicago Design Archive [www.chicagodesignarchive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015065219/http:/www.chicagodesignarchive.org/ \"www.chicagodesignarchive.org\") alongside Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Frederic Goudy, Oswald Cooper and many other great typographers and designers.\n\nIt’s sponsored by Chicago’s Society of Typographic Arts [www.sta-chicago.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015065219/http:/www.sta-chicago.org/ \"www.sta-chicago.org\") – the fun, gracious, straightforward and accessible organization dedicated to preserving the traditions of Chicago design and building a vibrant Chicago design community.\n\nDeadline is March 17.\n\nInterested? Then check out the Archive06 page at www.sta-archive.com.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015065219im_/http:/typophile.com/files/STA-Archive06.gif)\n\n",
