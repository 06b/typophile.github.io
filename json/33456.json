  "content": "I haven't seen any discussion about this logo around these parts, but I have to say, I think this is the most unappealing thing I have seen in a long time, and I thought I'd throw it out there for y'all to critique. There is so much to hate about it, the colors, the awkwardness... I myself am not a designer, but I love design, and I love hearing the expertise of those in this forum, so I thought I'd throw it out there.\n\nHere are my questions...  \n1. What do you think of this \"Diet Coke Plus\" look?  \n2. What do you think was the \"look\" that Coke was going for in this thing (which I obviously missed)  \n3. What would you suggest to Coke if they asked you?\n\nHave Fun.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805083806im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dietcokeplusresized_4004.jpg)\n\n",

They've been throwing so many variations out to the marketplace lately that I'm not sure I know what it stands for anymore.\n\nI don't think there's anything inherently wrong with the design itself. The rainbow device is fairly common in the vitamin and supplement marketplace.\n\n"
