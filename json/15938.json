  "content": "Hi there, i'm trying to come up with a logo for a new recruitment agency called 'alignment' focusing on staff with online skills. they're wanting sleek/fast/smart logo, the point being they bring disparate objects together, hence the name. so far this is what i've got. i'd really like to work something typographically but finding it a bit hard. the trouble i've had is that alignment in is kind of taken for granted, it's only when it's not aligned that we notice so therefore I feel it needs to be more dynamic, with some sense of movement, as a purely 'unaligned' or disjointed logo just doesn't work. any ideas? i don't think the hand ones are really that sleek enough, but it was just an angle i was trying. Also unsure about an icon thingee. rather than go for lines i was thinking more like planets or light refracting/focusing. any-which-ways, any advice would be much appreciated!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [A Logo v13.FH11.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20110128010724/http:/typophile.com/files/A%20Logo%20v13.FH11.pdf) | 72.1 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "6A on the second page speaks to me the most. Out of everything, it feels the most complete. While it's showing the 'a' in 'Alignment,' it's also got these dots that form a neat grid, despite the fact that the dots are connected at various angles. That direction seems closest to the idea of 'bringing disparate objects together.'\n\n"

I would look for a font that has more legibilty. This one is a bit hard to decipher.\n\nI also wonder if you could put a cross hair at the end of alighment. It would look like\n\nAlighnmen+\n\nCross hairs are the cheese so I hesitate to suggest it. But it would read & is simple. Also crosshairs as used by printers feel culturaloly different than those used on say - hunting rifles.\n\nMaybe it wont read...\n\nBut I think it could be good to keep going even as you work up an idea that seems promising.\n\n"

Many corporate logos have specific spacing for different usage as: sizing for print or signage. I would also get away from your computer and explore new ideas for Alignment. Did you look at type on a perspective casting a shadow. Type as blocks. See what I mean, just sketch, let your creativity come out and don't worry about the limitations of the computer.\n\n"

      "content": "Ashley some ideas in general. Do me one favor don't use Avant Guard ligatures until you have studied Herb Lubalin's work extensively. Its at best, its a long learning curve. The problem with logos are end use. Make a list of all the end usage and any idea that doesn't fit the end usage is probably the wrong idea. This is a general principial and its a rule thats waiting to be broken. Work on your logo in black and white and investigate color when you are in testing mode. Test the logo! Make the design process into baby steps. Don't try to solve all problems at the same time.\n\n"

A lot of your work seems like an inside joke with only the ones in the know will get it. Think about the common user and you will come up with simple solutions that communicate effectively. Isn't communications the goal or is it art for arts sake. Remember the logo isn't going to be alone in the communications effort. You will have supporting copy and possibly a tag line. Don't try to make the logo do all of the communications effort. Its like a acting troop, the logo doesn't need to be the star but a supporting member of the cast.\n\n"

Good idea here, having 4 parts aligened verticaly can point they bring separated objects aligened together. changing one of their colors \" the dot of i \" can mean there is no matter what object is. I just disagree with changing porportions of \"i\"'s dot for this trade gothic ( or alike ) font .. you may use red color.\n\nfor the other logo let me ask why avant garde? This font was basically done for being a logo for some magazine, and by just typing it is making me feel you redo the same logo of that magazine.. it need some more work to get it from that.\n\nfor 3 logos at top they are good start for something, I don't have a clear message yet from them.

I get your idea eben about just a dot. it was kind of the problem i was having before in that yes it is aligned, but that's not immediately realised, because in some way that is taken for granted with all typefaces. it is no more aligned than usual type so you'd need something more 'aligned' (?) or something unaligned (which then negates the brand, so i don't think that's good) in order to suggest alignment. sorry if that doesn't make sense. but thanks again guys&girls!\n\n"

      "content": "Hey there,  \nYou know I was thinking that you could really make a leap here and use something other than the simplistic alignment of shapes. You can make a visual connection by using other things that align. Furthermore, if you could incorporate a cliché or saying visually that would make it pop even more. Do a wordlist and really think of the different things that align. Think living, breathing, alive. Soldiers line up and this company recruits, there may be a great visual there. \"get your ducks in a row\" is a good one-liner that brings up very visual thoughts. Since this is a recruitment firm you may want to be warmer and down-to-earth. Anyway, these are just some things to think about and mull over.

They give personal attention to help people with their lives in and outside of a work environment. I think you really captured a human connection with a few of them.\n\n8B specifically: the adjustment and markers on the \"g\" scream personal attention. It is a graceful and clever way to say, \"Hey nobody's perfect, and we'll help you figure this out.\"\n\npage 2 #1-4: these examples also include an element of human touch. I would encourage you to include these non-typographic additions. It gives them more warmth.\n\nThe AvantGarde examples feel cramped and uncomfortable. Would you want to work between the \"l\" and the \"g\" in 1-5 columns A and B? I wouldn't. :)\n\n"
