  "content": "The attached monogram was done for a client over a month ago. They were happy with it, though they are currently exploring conventional logos and marks.\n\nIt is possible they will come back this. But either way, I am not quite satisfied with it and would love the assistance of some expert eyes and feedback on how I might make this a stronger mark.\n\nIt began as a hand-drawn sketch in outlines. I then filled in the letterforms and cleaned up. It's a fairly odd and cramped intersection of shapes, but while it feels a little imbalanced now, I think it has potential. My own eye tells me that it's the W (in part) that is throwing it off…\n\nIt is supposed to read WBS, though I'm not sure the hierarchy matters all that much.\n\nThank you,\n\n—Matthew\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [wbs\\_monogram\\_crit.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018114146/http:/typophile.com/files/wbs_monogram_crit.pdf) | 868.6 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "The B and S are beautiful. Do not change them if you can help it. The rigid W just doesn't go. Remove it and draw a new one that is _curvy_ and fits comfortably into the spaces. If you can, make the side arms of the new W reach up and curl over the top; this would help it seem more like it could be first.\n\n"
