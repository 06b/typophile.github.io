  "content": "This is a logotype I've been working on for a law firm in Sacramento, California.   \n   \nThey are both attorneys in business, healthcare, and labor. The client would like a subtle reference to the 'capitol city' , hence the dome-like union of the 'L' and 'S'.   \n   \nThe type is set in Bembo SC and Bembo Italic Osf.   \n   \nPlease critique me! Thanks!!!   \n ![ks.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010181631im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1934.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Well, it does need some spacing work. Like \"UY\" is too loose, \"IM\" is too tight, and some others. Latin caps generally benefit from looseness, although that's of course problematic in a logotype. In contrast, the second line I think is too loose, especially considering its \"informality\". BTW, would the rule look better shorter? Lastly, the comma's too big. What if you replace the comma with a tilde-thingie, to echo that dome ligature?   \n   \nBTW, that UC \"K\" I think \"opens\" the logo very nicely.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
