  "content": "Fellow Typophiles,\n\nI've been working on a pet project lately to get a useful mobile experience for Typophile — for those moments when you're on the go and want to get a quick snapshot of what's happening. The design allows you to quickly browse through the latest posts, and jump to the site to get involved if something catches your eye.\n\nIt's just a start, but the project has already undergone a number of improvements and revisions, and I'd love to get your thoughts for where you'd like to see it evolve.\n\n[http://typophile.com/m](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713204014/http:/typophile.com/m \"http://typophile.com/m\")\n\nScreenshots (iPhone):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713204014im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0243_5722.PNG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713204014im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0244_5947.PNG)\n\n",

Precision in terminology would be helpful.\n\nPlease explain further if you are one of the shadowy “moderators” of this site and if such CSS changes will be permanent.\n\nAlso, `m.typophile.com` is the generally accepted domain nomenclature. `/m` is not wrong, just unnecessarily different. The site should auto-detect a mobile device, show you the mobile-optimized version, and give you a link back to the conventional version. (Sadly, this is where we’ve arrived a decade after the `handheld` CSS media type was invented.)\n\n—  \nJoe Clark  \n [http://joeclark.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713204014/http:/joeclark.org/ \"http://joeclark.org/\")\n\n"

I mean in the overview (the first screenshot you show above) it'd be cool to see which Forum a post is in, and/or see more than one line of preview text. And maybe a \"updated\" time stamp to see what's new? But maybe that's already too much to squeeze on that screen.\n\nAlso:  \n- I second that being able to access one's own user tracking list would be nice.  \n- I agree that \"Launch Site\" is a bit weird in terms of wording, but it's nice to have that option so close.  \n- The loading indicator is super sweet! :)\n\n"

      "content": "The mobile version is very nice as far as it goes, but it's disappointing that you can't access the whole site in the same manner, just topics and main posts.\n\nI'm used to the way the standard Typophile pages work on the iPhone. The most awkward aspects are the pages that list topics, because they have a wide fixed width, and the text entry boxes for posting comments, which are also way too wide. Reading topic posts is okay, unless you want to see the name and avatar of the poster at the same time. Viewing the site in horizontal orientation helps, but I prefer reading in portrait orientation--less scrolling.\n\nIf the \"normal\" site was designed a bit differently, I don't think there would be much need for a custom mobile version, at least for the iPhone.\n\n"

Basically you could follow people like on Twitter, and it would aggregate their posts into one section, like how TweetDeck does it. So maybe you open up the Typophile app, and like with tweetdeck, the first window is akin to the normal Typophile homepage; you scroll to the right, and this window has all your posts and marks new replies; you scroll to the next window and it has all the people you're following.\n\n"
