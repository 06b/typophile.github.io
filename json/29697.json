As our FAQ says, these kinds of fonts are very cheap and easy to make.\n\nSimilar fonts I found during my search [FF ErikRighthand](http://web.archive.org/web/20091011005657/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-erikrighthand/); a free font called [Kaela](http://web.archive.org/web/20091011005657/http:/www.dafont.com/font.php?file=kaela) by Harold Lohner; and another called [Plz Print Bold Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20091011005657/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-erikrighthand/), by Rae Kaiser\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

It has essentially four versions of each cap letter, which allows a better simulation of hand lettering. Frankly, If I saw this I would think it was the posted font, unless I could compare each and every letter side by side. Only the stem-less U is an obvious ID style mismatch. To me the rest looks like it could be lettering by the same person who made the posted font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
