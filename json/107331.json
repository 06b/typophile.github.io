The Germany No.1 design was derived from authentic antique German stencil-plates.\n\nSurprisingly these stencil-plates offer a high contrast Didot design very similar to the French stencils produced and sold till today. The production time of these stencils is in the range of the German imperial period (1871–1918). Of course the usage period was even longer.\n\nThe font styles »Paint« and »Sketch« include 4 additional variations of base glyphs and figures. An extensive random function will mix the glyphs as you type - on proper OpenType-savvy apps like Adobe InDesign.\n\nAll styles offer an extended Latin character set.\n\n`\nNOTE TO THE ADMINS: Now all links working - please delet the previews post. Thank you.\n`\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VtgSteGerN1_01_5284.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VtgSteGerN1_02_5833.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VtgSteGerN1_04_6450.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VtgSteGerN0_4559.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VtgSteGerN1_06_5557.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VtgSteGerN1_07_4129.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144259im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VtgSteGerN1_09_4776.png)\n\n",
