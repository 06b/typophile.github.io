Is this an impossibility, or am I missing something?  \nThanks!\n\n",

You just have to download the scripts and place them in [InDesign folder]/Presets/Scripts/. Then it’s just a matter of bringing up the ‘Scripts’ palette (Window-\\>Automation-\\>Scripts) and start double-clicking. How difficult is that? ;^)\n\n"
