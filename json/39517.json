  "content": "So, I just started a webstore @ [http://www.blissfulcouture.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924093549/http:/www.blissfulcouture.com/). We sell luxury goods at discount prices. The target audience is women of all ages. The savvy internet shopper would probably be the main demographic; the ability to recognize a deal should influence one’s decision to purchase at our site.\n\nSo, most luxury logos I see are simple - text on solid backgrounds, etc. I would like the same for ours but I’m curious as to what I’d be looking to do. Obviously our current logo (if it can be called that) is awful and we need to do something pronto.\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n [‹ Good resources for specifying Chinese, Japanese and Arabic typefaces?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924093549/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39495 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Soft Return in Photoshop CS3 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924093549/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39455 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I think the only change that could be made would be to not have a Rasterized image of the wordmark. Also create an initialized version of the type, i.e. “BC”. Also mess around with the composition and placement of the words “blissful” and “couture”.\n\n"

It takes away from the premium look a bit.\n\n:: Probably not have the menu run so close to the logo. Would it be an idea to relocate it horizontallly in a slim strip below the black band?\n\n:: Could take the currency and brand selectors also into the lower band to avoid clutter on the top of the page.\n\n:: A relatively large image, some kind of headline, or even a fine pattern on the home page may set the tone of the brand. Right now it seems to get transactional too soon. Even if they are dicounted, you may still want to communicate that they are luxury products.\n\n"

I also notice the center header is not flush with the sidebars. Another possible change would be making the image box a standard height, regardless of image size. This would lock the product pages into a uniform grid, rather than where it waves up and down depending on product images\n\n"

Even here it’s a bit all over the place.\n\nYeah, your right. Luxury brands generally have just beautiful type nicely spaced. Besides, as a general rule of thumb, if the name is expressive, then keep the graphic simple. Blissful Couture even in this text, communicates a lot, so perhaps go for just a nice typeface. Warnock come to mind.\n\nWhat may be really cool would be to use:  \n [http://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/view\\_font.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924093549/http:/www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/view_font.php \"http://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/view\\_font.php\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924093549im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Bliss_6690.jpg)\n\n"
