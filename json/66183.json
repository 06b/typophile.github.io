Thanks!\n\n",

It released in 1953.\n\nI haven’t used or inspected the Bitstream digitization.\n\nI have a couple books in my collection which use Primer. Here are two images for you (not to scale). Note that the first example uses the short descenders in text, whereas the second uses the long descenders.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175636im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Primer_Woodpeckers2_3759.gif)\n  \n[_Song and Garden Birds of North America._ Washington, DC: National Geographic Society, 1964]  \n&nbsp;\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175636im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Primer_HessePage_4426.jpg)\n  \n[_Beneath the Wheel_ by Hermann Hesse (Michael Roloff, trans.).

      "content": "Century 751 was included, along with a wide selection of other Bitstream fonts, with the Corel office suite at one point, so probably many people have it on their computers. The proportions are like those of Century Expanded, but in addition to being lighter, it has a larger x-height.\n\nCentury Schoolbook is heavier than Century Expanded, and has a lower x-height - as well, the lower-case letters have a normal shape instead of being somewhat condensed. My suspicion is that Century 751 is intended for use at small sizes in newspapers or classified advertisements and the like, as it has some of the important characteristics of a legibility face.\n\nEDIT: However, the examples given in Kent Lew's post don't match the impression I got from the Bitstream version; they show Primer as being very suitable as a beautiful book face.\n\n"

      "content": "Christian, the Primer typeface featured in Kent Lew's books samples is a metal typeface, and unfortunately a faithful digital version is not available. Bitstream's Century 751 is a \"lighter\" version, also missing small caps and old style figures, and, generally speaking, very weak if compared to the original source (there also seems to be a digital version by Linotype, named \"Primer\", but I couldn't find any info or sample). At very large size, for titling and display purpose, Century 751 seems to work, but not really as a body text (I can send you a sample page to show you, if you're interested). What strikes me more is Primer's shapes linking to the Transitional heritage, Baskerville among all, which it makes different from the \"strong\" look of Century.\n\nA couple of years ago there was some interest in a new digitization of Primer, and I think this typeface deserves it - you can check an interesting discussion in this thread: [http://typophile.com/node/34046](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175636/http:/typophile.com/node/34046 \"http://typophile.com/node/34046\") But, as it often happens with this kind of type revival, the marketing request isn't strong enough.\n\nOn another level, and speaking of Century, there's an interesting version made in recent years by Mark Simonson, named \"Grad\" - very different from Primer, and with a very idiosyncratic italic, but it looks like a nice, working digital Century for setting books:\n\n[http://www.marksimonson.com/article/102/introducing-grad](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123175636/http:/www.marksimonson.com/article/102/introducing-grad \"http://www.marksimonson.com/article/102/introducing-grad\")\n\n"
