In combination they will help Microsoft Office users more quickly and easily create attractive and effective documents.\n\nReal fonts from real type designers  \nAscender worked with leading type designers and foundries to assemble a set of fonts that normally sell for over $500 if purchased separately. Fonts were carefully selected to provide an extensive range of designs which will help reinforce the message of many types of documents. Designer and font foundry participants included Gunnlauger SE Briem, Chank, Elsner + Flake, The Font Bureau, Steve Matteson, Steve Mehallo, Microsoft, Thomas Rickner and Mark Simonson. Each of the fonts had to meet Ascender’s exacting quality standards. These fonts are far and above the quality of shareware or jumbo-package fonts – they include 384 characters for extensive European language coverage and careful tuning for on-screen display with ClearType.\n\nMore than just fonts  \nThe Ascender Creativity Font Pack also includes a variety of helpful design tools to put the fonts into action. There are 40 smart-looking templates for Microsoft Word that are ready to be personalized. They cover a diverse range of activities: cards, invitations, stationery, certificates, flyers, forms and more for personal and business tasks. The Ascender Font Selector is a new utility for selecting the right font for the right situation. It allows users to browse through font previews organized by personality, occasion and type classification. Also included in the product is Roger C. Parker’s Design Tips – an illustrated design guide with a baker’s dozen tips and tricks from Roger C. Parker, author of 35 books on desktop publishing, design and marketing.\n\nSystem Requirements  \nThe Ascender Creativity Font Pack is a 3.4MB electronic download file.
