I  \nmanaged to get it back thankfully but it was a pain in the saa.\n\nYesterday afternoon I got a \"warning\" message from google asking me for a 2ndary email address for security reasons which I didn't respond to. Check/change your password to something strong if you have an easy one. Don't use dictionary words, include a cap, number, and alternate character. A good way to make a strong password is to think of a memorable phrase, then use the 1st letter from each word. If you get this warning email from google, answer it immediately as it only took the hacker 4h to break it. Then call your local police department to report fraud.\n\n",
