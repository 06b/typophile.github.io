  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nThis is a little non-paying side project for a friend who is incoming auditor of the DJ society of the local university. The brief is very loose, with simplicity important. I would be interested to hear thoughts on this concept… The execution is very rough at the moment.\n\nUses will mainly include flyers, T-shirts and posters.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019091506im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dj_soc1_4362.png)\n\nMany thanks,  \nRoss\n\n",
