You could easily redo the same by picking any gothic condensed of your choice and some slab serifs (strokes) to terminals.  \nIf you still need a close base font (possibly even matching), you can use [Steelfish](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620215026/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/steelfish) or [Trump Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620215026/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic).\n\n"
