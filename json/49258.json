Once a part of the FontShop.com website, the revamped font blog will now be a separate entity with its own website and address. It combines the creative forces of original FontFeed author and [Typographica](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/typographica.org/) editor [Stephen Coles](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Stephen%252BColes), prominent design writer [Jürgen Siebert](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/J%2525C3%2525BCrgen%252BSiebert) of [Fontblog.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.fontblog.de/), and [Yves Peters](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Yves%252BPeters) of [Unzipped](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.fontshop.be/) and [Typographer.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.typographer.org/).\n\nIn early 2008, Erik Spiekermann had a vision – gather a number of heavyweight type bloggers and start up an “überblog” squarely focused on typography and related subjects. Lending the type community a powerful voice, the outlet will bridge the gap between font users and font suppliers. Content will include typography tips and tutorials, recommended fonts, type reviews and bits of (typo)graphic design from across the globe. The articles should spark discussions and initiate a valuable and lasting discourse between type enthusiasts and professionals. Sponsored by FontShop International, it will nonetheless be an independent voice, free of any commercial restraints.\n\nSpiekermann didn’t need to look far for his contributors. FontShop.com already hosted the original FontFeed, edited by Stephen Coles. Coles rose to prominence through Typophile, the online community of type enthusiasts, and as editor of Typographica.org, the influential journal of typography featuring news, observations, and open commentary on fonts and typographic design.\n\nThe second contributor is even closer to home. Jürgen Siebert – co-founder of German graphic arts magazine PAGE – edits Fontblog.de, an online journal of design, typography and media which recently entered the Top 20 in the German blog charts. The final piece of the puzzle is Yves Peters, who writes his Bald Condensed type reviews on Typographer.org (listed in UK magazine MacUser’s “Secret Mac sites — 50 hottest web links that will keep you ahead of the crowd”) and edits Unzipped, the blog on the FontShop BeNeLux home page ( [www.fontshop.nl](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.fontshop.nl/ \"www.fontshop.nl\") or [www.fontshop.be](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.fontshop.be/ \"www.fontshop.be\")).\n\nThe new FontFeed can be found at its new address: [www.fontfeed.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042535/http:/www.fontfeed.com/). It will feature stand-alone articles and recurring topics from Stephen Coles and Yves Peters, with English translations of selected posts by Jürgen Siebert, effectively joining three top type bloggers on one single online journal.\n\n**About Erik Spiekermann**  \n_Prof. Dr. Erik Spiekermann is an information designer, type designer and author of books and articles on type and typography.
