One offer is for a copy of Crewekerne Regular in your choice of Truetype or Opentype formats. The other offer is for a fully licensed copy of any single face of your choice from our releases to date.\n\nRead all about the two offers [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211621/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\n",
