  "content": "Hello  \nI am trying to use and employer's collection of Univers. There are about 30 different individual files, varying by weight and width. Unfortunately they have numbers instead of names (\"Univers 57\") and I can't really tell which goes with what in regard to the width. There seems to be at least 4 widths of fairly subtle differences (although I'm sure people on here could tell the difference without much problem.)  \nWhy would these be numbered instead of named? Is there some logic to the numbering system I'm not getting? The numbers start at 39 and go up to 86, but there are many missing numbers along the way. Does anyone know of a chart I could look at that sorts these out by number into categories?\n\nSorry if my long rambling nessage is boring, but I would appreciate any help you can give me.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

They released it, and must have though the numbering system pretty hot.

Just like Helvetica vs. Neue Helvetica, there is Univers and Linotype Univers to choose from. Just remember that Linotype Univers was made at Frutiger's own behest (and he participated in its development), as he wasn't happy with Univers' transition to digital ;-)\n\n"
