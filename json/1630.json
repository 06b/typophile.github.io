I was looking for a different font ID, and saw Red Rooster's \"Hancock Bold Condensed\" and thought it looked a lot like URW Marlboro (which is apparently really called [Neo Contact D](http://web.archive.org/web/20131216050654/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/marlboro/)). I can see now when compared like this that the URW font is the identical look to the logo type, but if I was trying to 'fake' the Marlboro logo, the Red Rooster font was awfully close, and might have been the real inspiration for Marlboro's typeface, since it is a digitization of a 1917 Keystone Type Foundry typeface. I suppose the URW font must have come after the cigarette brand was developed.   \n   \nNone of this means anything for this ID, except it shows the lengths this obsession makes me go to, just to see how close something else might be. The game called 'what else could I use?' ![Marlboro matching](http://web.archive.org/web/20131216050654im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18604.gif)\n\n"
