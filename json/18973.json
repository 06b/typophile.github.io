      "content": "The design looks like been made between 1910 - 1925. Since the body text is the same design, it could be available on a type setting machine. The bold seems to have the same wide like the roman, so my guess, its a linotype matrice. In this time range, the First Hungarian Type Foundry has produced lots of typefaces and matices for this region. Berthold AG, [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20101114204659/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%2520Stempel%2520AG)and Bauersche owned this foundry.

This was an industrial area, and was virtually destroyed during the war. There is very little in terms of remaining materials, sadly.\n\nVarious museums or collectors would have printed samples of L&M faces. I think that these serve as better models for digitizing anyway. Matrices are a little thin, because they took into account that ink would spread on paper, creating the final letter image.\n\n"
