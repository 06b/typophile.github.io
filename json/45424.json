I like the combination of the over-inflated but still geometric look. I seem to remember a lot of stuff like this in the old Letraset catalog and on album covers from the 1970s.... ideas?  \nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111216181435im_/http:/typophile.com/files/445394343_cf55249c17_3420.jpg)\n\n",
