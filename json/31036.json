That's one thing that Bringhurst brings up. The italics were a separate style of type altogether.\n\nBold fonts were originally their own typefaces, but when the different foundries started consolidating, all sorts of stuff started getting tossed together into groups willy nilly.

Not that closely, you may say (and I'd agree) but more so than a completely unrelated slab-serif. Incidentally, roman types of the 1840s were tending to become more compressed, which must be why the normal width of Clarendon looks condensed to us. The wide version of the type, a beautiful piece of type-making (presumably, like the Clarendon, the work of the house punchcutter Benjamin Fox, a partner in the Besley foundry) was recast from original matrices (or electros thereof) by Stephenson Blake in the 1950s under the name of _Consort._\n\nI recall that this question of the 'related bold' was discussed in the original registration document for the Clarendon type in order to back up the foundry's argument that it was an original design.

This states that new media brings obsolesced \"ground\" back as \"figure\", part of the new form. In other words, the bolding effect of ink gain wasn't considered as a design feature (more of a bug), until it was seen in comparison with the new finer images. Then, once it was recognized as such, it was exploited and developed into the Clarendon style.\n\nThe first Fourdrinier machines were installed in the 1800s in England, and these mechanically pulped and pressed recycled rags (wood pulp not being used till the second half of the century).

Karl Görner, who was born in Germany in 1883, was taken on in 1907 as assistant punchcutter with Stephenson, Blake & Co., Sheffield and stayed with them for the rest of his life. He died in 1964. Görner was probably trained to cut steel punches, but the work I know about was cut in typemetal, and electrotypes were grown to make matrices for casting. This was quite a usual practice, in the UK and the US at least, from the later 19th century onwards.\n\nI was told that, years before, Görner had made the type that was thought up by Robert Harling and marketed by Stephenson Blake under the name of _Chisel_. He cast type from matrices for _Bold Latin Condensed_ and incised lines into the face. When SB wanted a bold and an italic to complete the _Consort_ series, Görner cast a bold slab-serif from some quite early matrices and pared it down to make _Consort Bold_. I don’t know if he had a model for the italic. Probably not. I think they are awful types – travesties of the original cuttings of Clarendon.\n\n"
