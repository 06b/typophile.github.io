  "content": "First post here...\n\nI have a client and we're looking to use the Hoefler Titling Light Swash, but the budget doesn't allow to buy the whole package, and unfortunately HFJ doesn't sell the individual faces. So we're sadly left trying to find a Typeface that will be able to fit the following:  \nA) Sold individually, not as package  \nb) Have some of the same characteristics as Hoefler Titling Light Swash, particularly the uppercase \"E\" and \"K\"\n\nThanks and help is greatly appreciated.  \nDaniel\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141118212257im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hoeflerTitling_6739.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [hoeflerTitling.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141118212257/http:/typophile.com/files/hoeflerTitling.jpg) | 36.45 KB |\n\n",

I also looked into the HFJ licensing individual fonts, but you have to purchase it for a WHOLE bunch of seats, which isn't really worth it $$ wise, cheaper to buy the whole family.\n\nLorem- These look really promising as well, esp the Caslon Italic Swashes.\n\nAgain, much appreciated.\n\n"
