While I do think that Trajan is a well crafted typeface, It is completely wrong for KU basketball jerseys or any sports jersey for that matter. As a KU alumni, it’s just sad to see this happen.\n\nsee also: [http://www2.kusports.com/news/2007/jul/19/uniforms\\_tweaked\\_again/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081206132728/http:/www2.kusports.com/news/2007/jul/19/uniforms_tweaked_again/)\n\n [‹ Co-Starring Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20081206132728/http:/typophile.com/node/37962 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Graphic Modernism from the Baltic to the Balkans, 1910-1935 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081206132728/http:/typophile.com/node/37953 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Sticking with a cohesive feeling with the new logo, I’m using Trajan for the title and subtitles now I just need to figure out what font to use for the copy.  \nAny advice is welcome.\n\nMy $.02 is that the entire logo redesign, while not a complete design failure, is a perfect example of how bureaucracy can muddle up anything. Spend too much on an unnecessary redesign that you can’t afford to change all of the media. It was probably someone at KU who just saw Troy, and said “Wow! I want our logo to look that cool!” and just kept insisting on it.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n [http://DesignerScott.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081206132728/http:/designerscott.com/ \"http://DesignerScott.com\")\n\n"
