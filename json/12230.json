  "content": "What is the # of em units to match a PC’s pixel? ( Not a mac’s ).\n\nThe reason I ask is that I have font which uses 1000 UPM & has 100em unit pixels ( vector not bitmap ).\n\nThis font looks nice & crisp at 10 pt - on a mac.\n\nBut it does **not** look crisp at any size on the PC. It has been true type hinted ( which helped alot ) but it seems quite clear - it just isn’t fitting the grid.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

Otherwise, 7.5 points should in theory render your font crisply.\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, operating systems will automatically query the resolution off the display using Extended Display Identification Data (EDID), so a “pt” will, once again, be 1/72” or thereabouts.\n\n"

Obviously this issue is only relevant if you are looking for a match \\*onscreeen\\* - the printed fonts would not match with this soultion. Still, that is what I was looking for. Thanks!\n\n"
