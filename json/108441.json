It's not the final design by that link. Anyway, what bothers me is that I've drawn many glyphs, including Cyrillic extended and Latin extended a and b and others. Is there any way to know what languages does my font support? Maybe a script or some kind of a web service?\n\nThanks in advance?\n\n",

      "content": "I don't know of any automatic way to do it. Your face supplies the glyphs for scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc), of which various subsets are used to write various languages. It would be nice to know that language Foo uses all of SomeBlock except Bar, with the addition of Baz and Qux from AnotherBlock. That would make it easy to say, \"My font provides full support for language Foo\", which it going to be more relevant to most people than saying, \"My font provides full support for the Latin script\". This information may be partially compiled somewhere (e.g. \"Latin alphabets\" on the English Wikipedia), but it's a manual verification process.\n\n"

      "content": "There is no such tool. I did a wide research about languages and alphabets between 2010 and 2013 for my own font project. Unhappily, no source is complete. If you have interest, here are some good information and sources:\n\nThe Wikipedia article about [Latin-derived alphabets](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062100/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-derived_alphabet) is the nearest single source I know. For deeper information, you can take a look on [each letter](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062100/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A) and language article published in Wikipedia. Each letter article brings a table with diacritical combinations.\n\nA good place regarding Latin script is [this post](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062100/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html) from Adobe's Typblography. You may also find useful [this site about diacritics](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062100/http:/diacritics.typo.cz/).\n\nRegarding transliterations, there is an [excellent archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062100/http:/transliteration.eki.ee/index.html) made by Thomas Pedersen. It's almost hidden in the Estonian Language Institute site.\n\nYou can also consider to do the contrary: define which languages you want to support and then include the proper characters. Unicode blocks are heterogeneous and the Latin ones brings together glyphs needed to less common European languages besides Asian languages, Medieval characters and even Roman signs.\n\nFor example: Latin Extended Additional includes 1E9E, the German uppercase double S. It seems ok to include that. In the same block you find the Vietnamese accented and double-accented vowels. Of course, you would ignore them if Vietnamese support is out of your target. This Unicode block also adds several precomposed combinations to support Indic, Hebrew and Cyrillic transliterations. Again, you must choose if transliterations would be supported.\n\nA similar definition must be made about Phonetic alphabets, currency and letterlike symbols. This will take some research, but you will not include unnecessary glyphs.\n\nSome additional data about Unicode blocks:\n\n1. Latin B has mostly glyphs to African languages, but also mix rarely used European glyphs and Pinyin transliteration.\n2. Latin C brings glyphs to Cyrillic transliterations and old African orthographies. 2C6D and 2C70 are needed to complete African support, the remaining probably are out of your scope.\n3. Latin D has many Medieval additions and support for old orthographies. Probably the whole block is unnecessary to you.\n4. Latin Additional is a mess. Define the languages and look in detail this block.\n5. IPA and Phonetic block. Just needed to phonetic support.\n6. Super and subscripts. Add the whole block if you want to keep up to date with contemporary type trend.\n7. Currencies. The very basic set is: dollar, cent, pound, yen, currency (generic) and euro. An improved set also includes thai, cólon, naira, won, new sheqel, kruvinia (hryvnia), tenge, new rupee (20B9) and tugrik. Most of others are historical.\n8. Letterlike. nº, liter, estimated, TM, and Ohm are basic. Others may be included or not according to your scope, but are not essential.\n9. Punctuation. Basic: 2002, 2003, 2013, 2014, 2018 to 2022, 2026, 2027, 2032, 2033, 2039, 203A, and 2044.\n\nHere in Typophile you will find a number of quite informative threads.

AFAIK, there are just four or five typefaces with this kind of support, and none of them is really goood.\n\nUnhappily, when I begun to do this, I do not registered my findings in an organised way –just made a large table with needed glyphs and some notes, but didn't listed glyphs by language.\n\nSome less known minority languages are poorly documented and it is really difficult to find data about the proper way to design their glyphs. But as a native Russian, you are entitled to find much more than I did.\n\nThis would give an idea (sorry for the large image):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062100im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2014-01-23_10-06-27b_4115.png)\n\nI know, quite a strange goal to a Brazilian, but I am addict to Cyrillic.

We use the data internally with a proprietary scanning tool.\n\nI do agree with Igor that “no source is complete,” and neither is my data. But it is considerably better than nothing. Most type designers just want to figure out either what characters to add to cover a given language, or what languages are supported by a given character set, and have a one-stop answer to the question. For the languages covered by this data—and there are a lot of them—it should be reasonably solid. Where I am suspicious of the data source or have not done sufficient cross-checks, that is noted in the file.\n\n"

The number of languages you cover is impressive.\n\nHowever your code for French (my mother tongue) does not appear to match what I read on your blog. If the characters listed in `subsetting-codepoints` are considered as accessory, then you have put there characters that are so frequently used in French that they are on the French azerty keyboard as well as the Canadian French keyboard, namely çèàùé (for the others you need to use a dead key); they are certainly not accessory.\n\nThe French alphabet is very clearly listed on the German Wiki [Französisches Alphabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062100/http:/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz%C3%B6sisches_Alphabet) as well as the French Wiki [Alphabet français](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062100/http:/fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_fran%C3%A7ais), where characters specific to French (to be added to what you call \"English\") are listed separately.\n\nSo, the small characters needed to be in the font to contain the French alphabet (and my understanding is that they should appear in `scanning-codepoints` similarly to what was done for Portuguese) are (using intervals)\n\n    0x00E0,0x00E2,0x00E6-0x00EB,0x00EE,0x00EF,\n    0x00F4,0x00F9,0x00FB,0x00FC,0x00FF,0x0153\n\nThe corresponding capitals are\n\n    0x00C0,0x00C2,0x00C6-0x00CB,0x00CE,0x00CF,\n    0x00D4,0x00D9,0x00DB,0x00DC,0x0178,0x0152\n\nThat list assumes, of course, that if `parent` is `English` then the scanning code points of English are inherited.\n\nMichel\n\n"

Why not choose Russian as parent for Ukrainian?\n\nIn the languages Tajik, TalyshCyrillic, TurkmenCyrillic, Tuvan, Udmurt you have Cyrillic as parent-name; the attribute \"parent-name\" is used nowhere else.
