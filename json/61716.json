  "content": "Fellow typophiles—\n\nThis issue confounds me. I am attempting to type a \"c\" in Word with a grave accent and the character simply isn't recognized. The type is Times New Roman (and I tried Helvetica Neue for kicks) and to no avail.\n\nIs this even a recognized character typically? It is the final letter of a last name belonging to a Croatian young man, to whom I am attributing an essay, hence my need.\n\n",

I did a search on a letter database site and it was not listed under any languages there.  \nAlso a lot of the older Microsoft fonts don't have extended character sets. If you have some of the Adobe fonts that come with apps such as the creative suites you can get extended language coverage, but I'd still doubt a cgrave would be included.\n\n"

      "content": "It seems that it will take some time for all the capabilities of Unicode to make it into common use. What's needed involves (a) operating systems, (b) applications program, (c) and fonts.\n\nI do know that what you want to do is easy enough with Windows Vista, running either Wordpad, Notepad, Open Office 3.01 (free) or MS Word in the newer releases.\n\nI do not know about Macs, nor have I tested Windows XP -- at least, not lately.\n\nOK, that's operating systems and applications programs. The font people have dragged their feet. Fortunately, SIL Charis (free & a pretty good typeface for writing manuscripts) has all the combining diacritics encoded. The combining diacritics really are needed with the Unicode system.\n\nSo, I know the following will work, with Windows Vista, Open Office (& Wordpad & Notepad & some releases of Word), and the font Charis:\n\nType a \"c.\" (Make sure the \"num lock\" is \"on.\") Now, hold down the \"Alt\" key, and with it held down, using the number keypad, enter the string 0300 (Unicode for combining grave accent). release the \"Alt key.\"\n\nThe above paragraph is simply one way of directly entering a Unicode character from the keyboard with a Windows program. Likely there is a corresponding way to do so with a Mac. If you're using a Mac, you can test things out as well. It is easier if you can eliminate one of the potential problem areas, so start with a font that has the combining accents completed, and maybe even good \\*mark\\* and \\*mkmk\\* features, such as Charis.\n\nIn sum, the font Charis is free (search for \"download Charis\") The Open Office products are free, and can even write off a .doc format. (Search for Open Office). For operating system support & upgrade, you're on your own.\n\nGood Luck,\n\nCharles\n\n"

The keyboard is also available for Windows and Linux but I have never tried it on those platforms.\n\nTo type c with a grave accent with the IPA-SIL keyboard, just type c and then SHIFT 4 (c with acute is c SHIFT 2). You can switch fast between the American keyboard and the IPA keyboard by just typing \"apple space\".\n\nWith Word 2008 for the macintosh, what I just described works fine with the Microsoft Calibri and Cambria fonts but not with Times New Roman; [**SIL fonts**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150313080704/http:/www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software_catalog.asp?by=cat&name=Font) Charis and Gentium also have those accents (and others) and what is necessary to position them above the previous character (that always needs to be in the same font).\n\nMichel\n\n"

It looks like the occurrence of this character is one time. He shouldn't need a special keyboard. (There are numerous languages where the isn't a special keyboard available.) If the fonts (from Adobe, from Microsoft) have combining diacritics, he should be able to directly enter the base character and the accent, if the applications program (Microsoft) & operating system (Microsoft, Apple, Sun,) allow/help/don't get in the way.\n\n"
