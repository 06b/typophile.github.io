Palatino Linotype reads well in MS Word on a Windows machine. I've personally been using Mercury Text for the past year for all of my reports and other mundane paperwork because it outputs well on the inexpensive laser printer my employer provides. It's a little light on the screen, but not bad. The one problem I have with Mercury (or most other typefaces, for that matter) is that Word doesn't handle ligatures - especially noticeable with the Mercury italic.\n\n"

      "content": "First of all, I see confusion between \"legibility\" and \"readability\". Not to oversimplify, legibility is the ability to decipher in adverse conditions, such as poor lighting, fog, visual impairment, etc. The gold standard for legibility ought to be ClearView, which was designed for road signage, and has some impressive research backing it up. Of course, other contenders such as Frutiger are perfectly viable alternatives.\n\nI assume \"readability\" to mean performance in an immersive reading environment, meaning in a nice long passage of text, in a comfortable chair, with good lighting etc. It's harder to quantify what \"performance\" even means (unlike a road sign, where you have a good decipher / no decipher test), but I take it to mean the combination of reading speed and comprehension.\n\nThe science on readability is sparse in the extreme, but for print, I think it's hard to beat any of the classic metal Monotype (and Lino) faces: Baskerville, Bembo, Sabon, Caledonia. As William points out, Caslon is also very nice, but there are many different cuts, and not all are especially nice, especially the digital ones. Similarly for Garamond. The Harry Potter books are set in the Adobe version, which is pretty good, but I did not like the spacing. Oh, and by the way, for both legibility and readability, spacing is even more important than the shape of the letterforms themselves.\n\nOn screen, it starts depending a lot on the rendering technology. Georgia is a pretty good bet, though. On Vista, I think Constantia is likely to be a pleasant and readable font, but I haven't spent enough time with it to say for sure.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n"

In some ways, it reminds me of Cheltenham, which I love and have always thought was a great onscreen typeface.\n\nThese new fonts were specifically designed for reading onscreen. They have larger, more open counters and less difference between the thinner and thicker strokes (more like Old Style, in this regard).\n\nNonetheless, I do find the \"3 Ls\" -- letterspacing, leading, and line length -- to have AS MUCH to do with readability onscreen as font choice.\n\nPoint size is an issue too, if you are reading onscreen, because your monitor/display is much lower res than the clarity obtainable in print. I would \\_hate\\_ bodycopy larger than 10 point in print, but sometimes even 13 point is easier to read on the computer. Somewhere between 11 and 13 point is often where the thickness of the strokes onscreen \"jump\" from one-pixel-thick to two-pixels-thick. This threshold has a lot to do with clarity and type color within each paragraph.\n\nAnd, as was mentioned above, depending on your monitor, ClearType may be a help. Same goes for the font smoothing options in Acrobat Reader. But this is an interaction between the technology and personal taste. I always turn them OFF for small type sizes. YMMV.\n\n"

It is impossible for me to simply recognizes words and groups of words without actually reading each one letter by letter. I do find clearview to be far easier for me read than other fonts. I guess the aspects that it was designed to address maybe similar to those that inflict me. Most words in our environment don't register with me, for unless I read them they have no meaning. I believe most people walk through life reading everything that passes though their field of vision, whether they want to or not, but if I were to try and read every passing word It would be crippling. I wonder if a font that could help dyslexia would also provide a normal reader with greater speed and comprehension as well? Especially if it were used in text book.\n\np.s.- I had to look up the spelling of dyslexia for the spell checker had no suggestions for the word I originally spelled. If you are naming a disability that effects a person ability to read and write words, why pick a word that is a terror to spell. Why not \"It\", \"At\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", or \"Tim\".
