  "content": "Hello all, I’m helping some artists out with a project and need to match some typefaces from a bunch of different books of sheet music. I’ve managed to find most of them, but am stuck on these four. I’ve tried What The Font, but haven’t had any luck. Sorry about the poor image quality here—all I have is some hand-held digital photos to work from.\n\nIf you can offer any suggestions I would very much appreciate it. Even if it’s not an exact match, that’s fine. Something close to the original, or its spirit is better than nothing. Thanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bondekvindelag1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122062028/http:/typophile.com/files/bondekvindelag1.jpg) | 58.05 KB |\n| [musicschool2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122062028/http:/typophile.com/files/musicschool2.jpg) | 42.31 KB |\n| [school2\\_01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122062028/http:/typophile.com/files/school2_01.jpg) | 40.57 KB |\n| [school2\\_02.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122062028/http:/typophile.com/files/school2_02.jpg) | 23.24 KB |\n\n [‹ The Leading Hotels of the World](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122062028/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48236 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Shaklee Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122062028/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48196 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
