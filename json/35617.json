  "content": "Hey,  \nBecause of the rather coarse resolution/grid of 1000 upm, the shape easily gets distorted by adding nodes at extremes. Especially in a really thin italic design. Would anyone mind sharing how you tackle this problem? Is it ok to leave some curves, like the bend of an italic lc “t”, unoptimized?\n\n [‹ trapping colors manually](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706222550/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35661 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [converting from Windows Word to Mac ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706222550/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35476 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
