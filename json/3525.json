  "content": "Folks,   \n   \nA quick update about what's been going on the last five days at Typophile:   \n   \nWe've experienced an unprecedented amount of traffic. In september, we experienced somewhere over two million page requests, largely creditted to the flood of traffic created by the Smaller Picture project.   \n   \nIn a nutshell, we got a fat bill from our host for using 12.6 gigs of bandwidth over our allotted limit. They shut down the smaller picture as it was causing server load issues. Inadvertently they shut down the forums as well.   \n   \nWe apologize for the downtime in the forums - thanks to those who alerted us to it. We'll try to get the smaller picture back up soon, with some modifications.   \n   \nWithout further ado, the floor is yours--   \n   \njared\n\n",

Even if its just a penny a pixel...pay to play man, tons of pixels to flip...exchange in service, revenue for bandwidth.   \n   \nthen sell the smaller picture font sets...even more mola. in fact sell it everyday in its current state. people could collect the smaller picture font sets. I'd be willing to bet it would cause a stir, debates on which set in which state was cool, which set clearly showed such and such of the collective brain..ect..ect. there should be a gazillion sets of the font published. ya...sell more stuff. hmmm wonder how the copyright and ownership of all that works out. haha\n\n"

I know I was having a hoot flipping pixels - it turned into a lunch time activity in our shop, putting a hold on the ever-enduring-Unreal T we had going.   \n   \nits just a suggestion.
