Quick summery is that the building is a historic mansion where we have we have 200 art classes and rent for weddings and events. I have a background in commercial photography and am a jr. designer. I am working on branding guidelines and a friend suggested I post here for font suggestions.\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated. Looking for a good san serif heading font and serif body font that my staff will have on their newest version of Microsoft Office or we can get for free/minimal cost.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417180308im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Callanwolde_Logo_Primary_500px_6302.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I don't know anything about what sans come free with MS Office, but here are a few thoughts.\n\nI actually like the current logo. It would be nice if you took the main font (Celestia Antiqua?) and customized the distressed effect so that characters that repeat are different each time.\n\nYou could put the second line in spaced sans serif caps (Gotham? Neutraface? Scala or Seria sans?) so that it matches the width of the name, or is just slightly narrower. The ornament should either be distressed to match the main lettering, or — of the lower line becomes sans — it could stay clean. The positioning is a bit weird because it feels off-center. I would maybe use the type or the ornament, but not together (in different contexts) or do something else with the ornament.\n\n"
