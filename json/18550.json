A PC version will be released shortly. Another highlight in this month’s newsletter is the work of Jürgen Weltin, one of Germany’s hottest young type designers. Jürgen’s two type families in the Linotype library are worth a closer look, as are two other display faces that round out our themes for March: Linotype Gavotte™ and Linotype Killer™. Linotype Gavotte™ is a classic calligraphic piece by Rudo Spemann, and André Nossek’s Linotype Killer™ is a techno face from the 1990s, whose design is as contemporary a model as Linotype Gavotte’s is noble.\n\n[Read the rest of the Linoletter at Linotype.com!](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808143352/http:/www.linotype.com/8-38-8-19420/issue200603.html)\n\nOr, [subscribe to the Linoletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808143352/http:/www.linotype.com/webshop/newsletter.php), and get the information delivered every month directly to your mailbox.\n\n",
