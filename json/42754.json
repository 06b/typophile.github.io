      "content": "In November, 2006 I asked that question of Typophile stalwart pattyfab, aka book designer Patricia Fabricant, who replied:\n\nFor an illustrated book for a commercial publisher, I usually charge between $40 and $50 per page. That includes design, layouts, typesetting plus one round of revised, additional corrections at $50/hour. Does not include picture research, scanning, retouching art, or dealing with the printer.\n\nFor a non-profit publisher or university press I’d probably charge the lower end of my scale - i.e. about $40/page (with the caveats above) for an illustrated book. For a non-illustrated book either around $20-25/page all in - plus extra for aa’s.\n\n"

For a non-illustrated book either around $20-25/page all in - plus extra for aa’s.</cite>\n\nNo university press I know of would pay that much, esp. for a non-illustrated book. Typical design fees for the interior of a university press book with a few illustrations range from $600 to $850 for a complicated text. This for a 6-1/8 x 9-1/4 trim, with anywhere from 500,000 to 1,500,000 characters.\n\nComposition is around $1.50/M characters, with a $0.50 per-page make-up fee. If you're setting a 2,800 character page, that would sum to around $4.75-$5.00 per page if the manuscript is supplied editorially correct on disk. We get a rather hefty penalty if there are fewer than 400,000 total characters. Placing illustrations with caption is around $2.50 each. Improving the usually terrible images is rather more. Alterations around $1.35 per occurrence (not line, that went out with repro). Paper proof sets extra.\n\nA rather well-known designer (whose book on design is often recommended on Typophile) has a minimum of $800 for a text interior -- that's design only, composition would be extra, but along the lines of the paragraph above.\n\nThe jacket is on top of that.\n\nI guess things are far different in the commercial world; I've noticed students graduating from design school seem to expect a higher starting salary than I get now.\n\nAn illustrated book can be far different, it depends on what is needed.\n\nI've been doing the composition bidding for my company since 1980. We use more or less the prices I've mentioned, and we are considered a little pricey. We only deal with university presses; I don't feel comfortable venturing guesses about commercial publishing. They do require faster schedules.\n\nI do know of museum catalogs going for $20,000 back in the late 1980s (just design & layout), but you could count the number of people who got that kind of work with available fingers & toes.\n\n"

      "content": "My fee quoted above includes the cover design.\n\nI don't do a lot of non-illustrated books and those I do are usually for trade publishers, not university publishers. I have done art books for university presses (Yale and Princeton) and their fees are commensurate with what I quoted above. I do have one publisher client who pays a bit less - more like $30/page but their books have very little text, they are mostly picture/caption, so once you have the grid and sequence it goes very quickly. I do a lot of cookbooks, where the composition is far more involved than, say, a novel.\n\nIt's much more common to use a per word rate than per character for text-only books. It can range from 3 to 7 cents a word depending on the publisher. I used to do a complicated x per page + y per picture + z per word type of formula but life is too short for that.\n\nI charge a fairly hefty fee for dealing with the printer basically because I hate doing that and would rather the publisher/client take care of it themselves.\n\nCharles's quotes seem low to me. Even 10 or 15 years ago you could get $5 or more per picture. But like I said, I find it easier to establish a page rate all in. Seems to work ok for me, as long as there is some flexibility on both ends.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>It’s much more common to use a per word rate than per character for text-only books. It can range from 3 to 7 cents a word depending on the publisher.</cite>\n\nAgain, must be a difference between trade publishers and university presses. I've bid a lot of jobs, including long-term contracts prepared by the presses, and never seen a per-word quote. (We too work with Yale Press; but I'd guess Patty works with the Mary M side.)\n\nThe reason image work costs rather more is that you can be asked to spend so much time on each one. If you are given a picture, told where to crop it, how big it should be, where to place it, etc., it doesn't take much time. That's the $2.50 price -- actually, the $2.50 is just to place it with the caption, we also charge a minimum of $5.00 more to deal with as an image.\n\nIf you are given a picture and have to do that work yourself, the time can rise sharply. If you are asked to improve the image quality, the time can really rise. My partner does the best image work at our shop; and to fix a color image takes at least 1 hour, and that's just to correct the color balance & enhance detail. Black & white can take 20 minutes each. None of our customers will pay the costs of this work, it has to be \"subsidized\" by the text profit. & BTW, our shop time is a bit higher than Patty's. When all is said & done, if we have to scan the image, prepare it (includes \"image enhancement\") & place it, our typical charge is about $15 for B&W continuous tone, and $25 for color. That still doesn't quite cover all our costs, the text subsidizes the art. If there isn't much text, you (well, we) would have to charge more. But it doesn't sound like you are being asked to do that amount of work.\n\nAnd yes, dealing with a printer can be time consuming. Esp. if you do the color management work (and you'd better; the number of printers who do a good job of this is quite small). You can ask for their numbers, but about half the time what they give you is nonsense. Then, if you care, there needs to be a test & you have to work out the numbers for them. If it's color job, work to their proof system; they can be expected to get their presses to match their proofer -- well, not all can at first, but it's a good starting place.\n\netc.\n\nEDIT: I'm sorry, one of the reasons I got off on this & gave such detail is that it points out there are different markets, different pricing structures, different rates, and different schedules. When you are starting to work in an area, a book dealing in generalities like the one referenced above, can be misleading. It all depends on a particular market.\n\n"

      "content": "Let me confirm what charles\\_e says, but from the other side of the table. The press where I am design & production manager is not located at a university, but we publish in that realm, and are active in the Association of American University Presses. Design fees for trade or scholarly books start a bit lower than the fee charged by the well-known designer Charles mentions and go to about that upper limit: design fee only, for which I get specifications and a Quark or InDesign file upon which the compositor can base its work. Shops I hire for trade or scholarly book composition charge pretty much what Charles notes. Most of those shops give us a per-page charge and a photo placement charge. Illustrated books are considered individually: a 4-c book throughout, with tint bleeds, might get a different fee than a duotone book with photos placed on white. & jackets or covers are of course additional.\n\nThe highest fees for museum catalogs I have heard come from one of the top-flight Manhattan designers of this sort of book. Six years ago, when I was trying to establish a fee for a freelance job, I had no idea what to charge. I consulted this pal, who told me a decent fee would be about $20 per page, to include design and composition; editorial alts to be extra. Knowing that my university press client would not pay that I came in at around $12 / page, plus air fare for two trips to the campus to work on photo sequencing and design. I felt like I was making huge bucks on that.\n\nThe only time I see the sort of fees Patty cites are when I approach big-dog designers on special projects. They tell me the fee they’d charge for a corporate book, and then we negotiate down. The prices I get are still pretty stratospheric for my market, but we at times pay them for this kind of expertise.\n\nI don’t pay folks to deal with printers. That’s my job, and is dependent in large on relationships built over many years, relationships I cannot necessarily count on freelancers to have.\n\npowers\n\n"

I have heard of designers getting as much as $100/page. And as I said above, my page rate does include the jacket.\n\nCharles - yes, I did work with Mary M.\n\nOne of the reasons I like book design is that there is a structure. There are editors for the editing (altho an eagle eye designer is always appreciated) and production managers to handle the printing. Schedules are \\*generally\\* reasonable. The scope of your job is clear, and the fee structure is also transparent. When I do work for other types of clients I often find myself having to pick up far more of their end than I want to. They don't always understand or appreciate exactly what I do. And furthermore they think they own you, that it's ok to call friday evening and expect something first thing monday, failing to grasp that you have other jobs, other commitments, and perhaps even a life. The art directors, editors and production managers I deal with in book publishing generally have the same investment in the project that I do - we all want to make the book the best it can be, but it isn't our \"baby\". Or, that is, we have a lot of babies and have to find time for all of them. Most of the time when I stray outside of book design I end up regretting it.\n\n"

Back in those days they estimated $8-25 per page for dummy; $15-40 for mechanicals, exclusive of jacket or design.

      "content": "Will,\n\nI'd point out one large difference; Patty is including the jacket with the charge for the interior. A jacket design would add at least another $800 to the book. The two are usually separate in university press publishing -- for example, I'll design an interior, but will not touch a jacket. There are people who will do both, but there are also people who prefer to do just jackets, or occasionally, like me, just interiors.\n\nIf you sum the costs, say $800 for the jacket, $700 for the interior design, and $2,500 for comp, thats $4,000. If it is a 250-page book, that's $16 a page. That would cover about 20 images, text size B&W. That is a little less than what Patty's talking about, but I imagine the art books she deals with have rather more image requirements.\n\nAh well, back to taking apart & re-doing Arno. It would add 4-6 hours for every job if I don't re-kern & re-write the features. With Arno, it'll take a week, but after the first 10 books, we'll be money ahead.\n\nCharles\n\nEdit:\n\nWill, good duotone work costs more than 4-c work. At least from us. Note I said \"good.\"\n\n"

I can do that if they ask to but they don't. And it would come out more or less the same.\n\nJackets can command more like $1500 from trade publishers. More if you are doing custom work - photoshop, commissioning illustration, hand lettering, etc.\n\nAnd yes, I work on books that often have images on every page, or several. Each page/spread requires individual attention.\n\nCharles - are you working in Quark or InDesign? As I am sure you know, Quark lets you save your kerning tables for other jobs.\n\n"

I have never gotten a font from a foundry I considered adequate for our work, at least not <cite>economically</cite> adequate. But I've said this before, just rehashing old news. Arno needs work with the punctuation, and the superscripts for note calls. Too, I have never liked Adobe's too-tight kerning.

Designers I work with will often give us a lower rate if they are doing a design that is only two colors, and does not involve a range of page tints and type colors. It does not mean that design of duotone books is not quite complex and even difficult; it just reflects what I’ve been charged.

I have done other sorts of graphic design work (ad agency type director), and none gives me the satisfaction book work does.\n\nAnd many others feel the same way.
