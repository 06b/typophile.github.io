  "content": "Hi all,  \nA birthday is coming up for a close friend. He is very into fonts and I would like to explore the possibility of getting a font book of some sort. I’m thinking more coffee-table like (history of fonts) rather than a book about how to use fonts and such.\n\nAre there any such books? A book on Futura would be especially great.\n\nThanks.  \n-Will\n\n [‹ OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808145714/http:/typophile.com/node/17686 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [After a type designer in the UK ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808145714/http:/typophile.com/node/17618 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
