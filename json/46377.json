  "content": "I was wondering if our goodly Typophile (web)masters would be willing to add a custom Typophile icon to the website, so when those of us with iPhones/iPod make home screen bookmarks for the site, we'd get the cool Typophile T instead of a tiny white box with specks on it (it automatically uses an image of the webpage if no icon is present.\n\nIt's [very simple](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151454/http:/www.askdavetaylor.com/how_to_create_custom_apple_iphone_website_icon.html): you just drop a .PNG on your site in the prescribed way (see linked instructions for details) and the iPhone/Touch will pick it up, round the corners and add that shiny look automatically for anyone who adds it to their home screen (which I have).\n\nAs a designer, I am pained at the lack of a swank Tyophile badge on my home screen, and would be grateful to those empowered to make one available.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
