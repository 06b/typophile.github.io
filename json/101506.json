I have heard from designers before who worked for them adapting other fonts to be Disney -unique versions.\n\nIt's a somewhat generic Art Deco look that I suspect is a composite of several designs.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The shape of the 'S' is similar to the [Rennie Mackintosh](http://web.archive.org/web/20130715061137/http:/myfonts.us/CR0Sol) type seen on other hotel signage. FWIW, the logo is usually in all caps, the faux small caps seems to be an alternate version.\n\n"
