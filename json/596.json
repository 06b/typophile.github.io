  "content": "The new book honoring Hermann and Gudrun Zapf is   \nwonderful. (sidenote: And it supports my theory of   \nhusband and wife being lovers of the shapes of letters.)   \n Anyway, as some of the people on this list know me   \nfrom school I thought it would be fun to admit that as I   \nwas looking at the samples of Optima within the book I   \nfound myself actually liking the face. What happened to   \nit when it became digital? The samples in the book are   \nmuch less harsh and the contrast between thick and thin   \nis less obvious. I'm assuming that Hermann was involved   \nwith the digitization, is this incorrect?\n\n",
