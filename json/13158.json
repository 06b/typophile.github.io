So lets take another stab at it.\n\nThis time with better photo reference.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Racubah!.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=Racubah!.jpg) | 82.68 KB |\n| [Racubah!HiRes.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=Racubah!HiRes.jpg) | 49.7 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "The reason people think it’s hand-lettered (and I still do) is that the characters are not consistent. It is possible that the entire thing was done by hand.\n\nLook at the two l’s in collection for example.\n\nIt’s also possible that someone typeset this initially using an existing font and then traced over it by hand to get the rough effect.\n\n"

      "content": "Hey, I think those two “l“‘s appear different because I spilled silk screen washing chemicals on my source art and the type got distorted when the image dried.\n\nIf you look at other characters on the recto side such as “e”, “r”,”n”, “s”, and “a” they appear the same throughout, plus or minus spacing. Look at “Manu Dibango” and “Mamba Percussion”. Also look at the numberals. Those letter forms are more similar than unique. This is clear when looking at the type with a magnification lense.\n\nThe irregularity is mostly because my source art is warped.\n\nI think the quest to ID this typeface is still on.\n\nThanks for your input Patty Fab(ulouso)!\n\nBookie\n\n"
