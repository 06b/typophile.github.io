Erik started to collaborate with [Just van Rossum](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922031538/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Just%20van%20Rossum) under the name [LettError](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922031538/http:/typophile.com/wiki/LettError) in Berlin, while working at MetaDesign. After experimenting with computer programming in connection to type design, they came up with [Beowolf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922031538/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Beowolf), the first typeface with a mind of its own. It was released by [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922031538/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop) in July, 1990. The radical approach of Beowolf caused a lot of publicity for LeTterRor, and of course fame and fortune. Well, fame anyway. After stints at several places in the world, including David Berlow’s [Font Bureau](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922031538/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Bureau), van Blokland settled in The Hague as an independent designer, working together separately with van Rossum. Their work now includes type design, illustration, magazines, corporate design, interactive design, animation, music, and websites. And lectures.\n\n",
