  "content": "Hello\n\nI am new here and also new to fonts creating,  \nI just registered because I want to create a (smart) font but I'm not sure how to do it.\n\nThe font will be only UPPERCASE characters, that I will create in Illustrator and then paste in Fontlab, and I want to create multiple character instances/glyphs for every letter, and basically rename them A, A1, A2, A3, ... X, X1, X2, X3, and so on. The differences between these Xs for examples would be that:  \nX is the regular X  \nX1 is the regular X with a \\_ (line) added on the bottom left corner ( \\_X )  \nX2 is the regular X with that line on the top left corner  \nX3 is the X with both lines on the left.\n\nThe purpose of these characters is that when I type LX, the font to automatically replace the X with X1 in this case, so the L is joined with X due to that bottom line;  \nAlso if after that TX (TX2 actually) I type another X, the font to change this new X with X3 in order to be linked to the previous X (X2 actually) perfectly by two lines now (X3 has one line on top left and another line on bottom left corner).\n\nBasically I think this needs to be something like the fi substitution but I've never done this before, and not sure how I can set up my glyphs and create the syntax to change only the i from f i instead of replacing the whole f i with a new fi glyph.\n\nI hope I was clear enough, any help/suggestion is greatly appreciated, Thank you.\n\n",

But I don't know how to import/name all these a1 a2 ..-\\> z3 in fontlab and how to create/write the calt or dlig syntax(?) in the opentype dialog box.  \nI will also search for alternates within a font, thank you.\n\n"
