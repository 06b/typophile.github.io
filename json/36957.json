  "content": "hey guys\n\ni am currently working on my new website. i have made quite some progress over the last few days (ehm... nights ;-) ) . however, yesterday I was showing the page to my girlfriend (she doesn’t study design - a fact that imho makes her conclusion even more credible for that she is not a pro but a user) and her sister and they both agreed, that the type is just too small. now I have my mac-screen set to 1680x1050 (20inch) and I didn’t get the feeling it’s too small - it looked just fine. I mean, when you have a resolution of “only” 1024 then it’s even bigger. so maybe it’s just me, you get used to even the worst design blunders, when you sit on your project for too long. I am well aware of the fact, that my chosen font (American Typewriter) is not an ultra font.\n\nwhat do you experts think - is it readable or too small? - in my screenshot I’ve also tried Frutiger 55. My beef with Frutiger is that I do like the font a lot for signs or airport boards but for my website I get the feeling it might be to “simplistic.”\n\ncheers,  \njan\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture-5.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202185927/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-5.gif) | 74.41 KB |\n\n [‹ Anyone recognise this font?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202185927/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37044 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [OpenType, TrueType, Type One PostScript ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202185927/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36876 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If you are working in Adobe illustrator CS3 (you can specify when creating a new document) that the resolution is 72dpi and pixel preview. Go into the preferences and create a grid 10px by 10px with 10 subdivisions. Make it snap to grid (The clue here is to always think in pixels even with type (size and leading). If you do this it should solve the problem. Do this also if you are creating images of the text and save for web directly from illustrator (Make sure you create a background box which is exactly the documentsize and aligned to the artboard).\n\n"

I hate that too, but it’s not gonna work. Plus - who got American Typewrite pre-installed on a Mac or PC?\n\nso it’s all gonna be images - gif’s. No flash, traditional html and javascript coding. I could have done it in flash, but why, if javascript does the job just fine as well.\n\nI won’t stick to American Typewriter I guess, you’re right, the serifs clutter and it’s just not working out.

      "content": "i guess you guys are right!\n\nwell lets see then - how about using a flash script like on this site, where I can define a sans-serif type that fits, one that is clear and readable in small sizes. I have Frutiger or Avenir in mind. I’ll set it to about 10px. So when the user has flash blocked, it will refer to a standart font like Verdana.\n\nYes, Georgia is a very nice font, agreed. I won’t stick to AT - I’m through with that. I just like the font a lot - I am very fond of typewriter faces - dunno why, I like that they have increased tracking, I like the overall shape of american typewriter, it’s massive serifs. it looks rough but elegant at the same time. it looks standardised still uneven but charming. I love the touch and feel of a sheet typed on a real old fashioned typewriter. You can feel where the machine hit the pages, you can see the ink that has been absorbed by the pores of the paper. It’s the real thing - no computer can imitate that. I don’t know, I just love the type, you don’t have to agree with me, just my oppinion. I agree with you guys, it doesn’t look right in really small sizes so I won’t use it. Don’t want my users to go blind ;-)\n\nNow that I’ve thought about it, I might even use a serif font - I love Glypha and Caecilia (maybe Caecilia 55 or 75) - maybe it’s because they kinda remind me of some typewriter font.\n\nhow do you think about that?\n\n"

This is why I do not like it as a font. Each a looks the same, each g the same. Typewriter fonts on a computer doesn’t really do it for me. But then again that’s just me. Everyone else is of course entitled to their own opinion.\n\nThe thing about Georgia is that it is made for screen and will not appear blurry in the edges like Avenir or Frutiger, Glypha or Caecilia will appear. This is the reason I suggested it. Do a search for forum topics concerning webfonts here on typophile to find which a made for web (also flash). If you cannot find one start up a new thread where you ask for it.\n\nIt just seems to me you are so focused on how this thing should look that you are willing to ignore the user (your target audience).

I know - not in this combination (that’s what my Swedish friends told me at least) - but still, there are very, very few Jan-Rasmus’ in Germany (I don’t know any). So my Dad is very much into Scandinavia and England, and I guess that fondness transferred onto me- I prefer traveling up north rather than going south. I used to live in London for three years where I made lots of good friends. About Scandinavia: I like the clean air, open water, landscape, the people and food. I always had a Fjällräven while all my classmates in highschool thought their Eastpak’s were cool - yeah, right. They all looked the same. Now in design university I’m still the only one with a Fjällräven - yesssss. And last but not least - I like Scandinavian design a lot.\n\nSo much about my Scandinavian “roots” ;-)\n\n"

I can only learn... :-)_\n\nOne way to think of it is that you are simply designing within a given medium. No more than you might use oil paint with a watercolor paper, or more extremely, chisels with a canvas, the web is what it is, and what seems like a weakness of the format (people messing with what you make) can be what distinguishes it (interactivity). Another analogy; you don’t design a car to exist in 2d. And if you are lucky, you get to design the underpinnings at the same time as the outer lines.\n\nThe choice between basic javascripts, ajax, flash, and a million other dynamic scripting/pretty rendering solutions is, for now, wide open. Each has advantages, and I would recommend considering not only the simplest to create with, but to maintain with your skills.\n\nIf you really want the typewriter look, try to find a good typewriter, and scan in some blocks of splash text. Done sparingly, with the appropriate accessibility (err) attributes can do a much better job than most Typewriter fonts, and cheaper if you already have a scanner. You can type a nice justified block with the mechanical carriage return, a tricky half-spacer and all the real nuances that we once hated, and still be having fun when the sun rises. I am partial to a Smith-Corona Clipper, myself.\n\n"
