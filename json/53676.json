They have an excellent selection of old specimens and type books. They're usually closed on weekends, but their schedule is a bit erratic, so you never know.\n\nAnd it's a shame you won't be in town the following weekend, when the [Ephemera Society](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027182035/http:/ephemera-society.org.uk/) has one of their big fairs. Those are an absolute treasure trove!\n\n"

I'm staying until tuesday, so i'll have time to look into Collinge and Clarke too.\n\nI read somewhere that both Foyles and Maggs have typography books, anyone know anything about them? How about Zwemmers? Foyles is pretty famous i gather, but i'm totally blank when it comes to London shops. Harrods who?\n\n"

They are a very big store with well-stocked departments on most subjects, and a very nice neon sign which I think dates from the 1930s.\n\n[Maggs](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027182035/http:/www.maggs.com/) are a specialist antiquarian dealer.\n\nSadly I don't think Zwemmers have any stores left in London.\n\n"

I'm definitely checking out Collinge and Clarke, i looked it up on Wikipedia and found that it's the store from “Black Books” – which my girlfriend recently bought the entire series of on dvd. Now she's got a reason to come with me to look at musty old type books! Yay!\n\n"

The real Collinge & Clarke interior is very small and cramped. But consider yourself fortunate that the booksellers have quit smoking: one used to need a gas mask when visiting the shop.\n\n"
