  "content": "I am mac based at work and I had an issue with a font.  \nI opened a pdf in acrobat and the font on my screen was different and printed out different than a co workers computer did.  \nI went to my font library in my macintosh hd and loaded the font that they said they had. Then the font showed up after i restarted acrobat and opened the file. I run suitcase as well. What is the deal? Do i have to have all the fonts i use in suitcase in this font library in my hd. I mean i go through a lot of different fonts during the year with different jobs.  \nCan anyone give me advice on this?\n\n",
