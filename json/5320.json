      "content": "\\>\"Unfortunately however, sales of font software for Precision Type and many others companies in the font business have been adversely affected in recent years by a growing supply of free font software via the Internet.\" (From Precision Type's announcement)   \n   \nIs that really the case?   \n   \nPossible culprits:   \n   \n1. Free fonts: bundled with applications (Adobe)   \n2. Free fonts: with operating sytems (Apple, Microsoft)   \n3. Free fonts: Freefonts.com, etc.   \n4. Cheap font collections: Adobe, Bitstream, Corel   \n5. Pirated fonts: online p2p   \n6. Pirated fonts: b2b   \n7. Online competition: mega-stores (Myfonts, Fonts.com)   \n8. Online competition: proliferation of online foundries and distributors   \n9. Competition in general: eg Veer's DM + online   \n10. Product selection.   \n   \nOn this last point, it may be that Precision Type had over-associated itself with foundries (see list on its obituary page) that started out as \"wholesale suppliers\", but subsequently ramped up their \"factory sales\" internet activity to become much stronger competitors.\n\n"

They are also illegal in many countries, in contravention of \"Fair Business Practice\", but the authorities are not going after the font perp's, their #1 target is Microsoft -- as with the recent EU fine of Microsoft for bundling other software with its OS.   \n   \nHere is a section from the Canadian Competition Act, \"Offences in Relation to Competitiion\":   \n   \n50. (1) Every one engaged in a business who   \n   \n(c) engages in a policy of selling products at prices unreasonably low, having the effect or tendency of substantially lessening competition or eliminating a competitor, or designed to have that effect,   \n   \nis guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.   \n   \nThis is an \"anti-dumping\" law, which would apply to bundling free software, but as with many things digital, there appears to be a different standard as to what businesses can get away with.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick,   \n   \nThere is a pretty huge difference between Microsoft's bundling web browsers and media players in their operating system, and other folks bundling fonts with their applications. Among other things, I doubt you'll find folks engaged in font bundling writing notes to each other about how the small type foundries must have their air supply cut off.   \n   \nI rather suspect that making false public allegations that somebody is breaking the law can get you in trouble. I don't know whether your current comments are libellous. I also don't know how much of a defence ignorance is against a libel lawsuit. I just think you should be a little more careful.   \n   \nThis isn't a threat or anything: even if I was personally ticked off enough to talk to our lawyers, I doubt Adobe would bother with this sort of nonsense. But you're making pretty broad blanket statements, and some folks in the type industry are much more aggressive in their legal activities than Adobe is.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

I do know many european countries prohibit the selling of a product at a loss to cut the competition out.   \n   \nOf course, in the US, we don't really care about that (in the legal sense) and let businesses get away with that.   \n   \nThe big issue with digital media, though, is that the cost of replication/distribution can be argued at being close to nothing.\n\n"

      "content": "_Also, did Precision Type ever offer online ordering and downloading of fonts?_   \n   \nIt's been four years since I worked for a company that was a reseller for Precision Type (Beowulf in St. Paul). At that time they sent us several CDs with all their fonts. We'd send a P.O. for the font we wanted and they'd send us a code to unlock the font. We could then e-mail the fonts to our buyers. At the time it seemed speedy!   \n   \nI use their book often when trying to track down unfamiliar typefaces. However, it's much easier just to post a sample here on the identification board. The speed of responses here is just amazing!   \n   \nkristin\n\n"

But this is simply hypothetical and for entertainment purposes only.   \n   \n\"Bundling\" is not a legal definition, but \"tied selling\" is.   \n   \nSo here is my \"NON LEGAL\" opinion about \"tied selling\".   \n   \n�������������������������   \n\\<Exclusive dealing and tied selling   \n   \n(2) Where, on application by the Commissioner or a person granted leave under section 103.1, the Tribunal finds that exclusive dealing or tied selling, because it is engaged in by a major supplier of a product in a market or because it is widespread in a market, is likely to   \n   \n(a) impede entry into or expansion of a firm in a market,   \n   \n(b) impede introduction of a product into or expansion of sales of a product in a market, or   \n   \n(c) have any other exclusionary effect in a market,   \n   \nwith the result that competition is or is likely to be lessened substantially, the Tribunal may make an order directed to all or any of the suppliers against whom an order is sought prohibiting them from continuing to engage in that exclusive dealing or tied selling and containing any other requirement that, in its opinion, is necessary to overcome the effects thereof in the market or to restore or stimulate competition in the market.\\>   \n�������������������   \n   \n   \nInterestingly I remembered a small quirk in this act. Rather alarming. Read on.   \n   \n   \n\\<Application for inquiry   \n   \n9. (1) Any six persons resident in Canada who are not less than eighteen years of age and who are of the opinion that\\> **Points to the section shown above.**   \n�������������������������   \n   \nPeople may think twice about membership in \"Trade Organizations\". Could get you in heaps of trouble.   \n   \n�������������������������   \nTrademarks could potentially fall on their face under this act if they were not \"earned\" but merely \"paid for\" in order to induce exclusionary trade advantage. Another \"NON LEGAL\" opinion.   \n�������������������������\n\n"
