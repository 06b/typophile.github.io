Or is it just me?\n\nApparently, long copy conforms to the baseline. (Without my asking it to! How convenient, for one thing.) But I find it a little weird that the Baseline settings are found in the Preferences menu. And that, unlike the type with which it works, Baseline is adjusted in increments of inches/picas/etc., and not, point.\n\nIs there a justification for this? It seems like a poorly placed control that’s set up in a way that makes it harder to control.\n\n",

One could argue that leading is measured in points in general (as well as in InDesign!), but one could also argue that the baseline grid is meant for the Respect the Grid guys, who don’t care for leading but _want_ to define this grid in their own design units.\n\n"
