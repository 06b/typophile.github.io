I ordered a portfolio with accessories today from [http://www.officepdx.com/index.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907033742/http:/www.officepdx.com/index.php \"http://www.officepdx.com/index.php\"). I ordered the portfolio cover wrong; it was a little confusing. They not only checked my order for accuracy, which I thought was fantastic, they also called me to tell me about the problem. They had already corrected it and were shipping the order.\n\nI think this is fantastic customer service.\n\nSharon\n\n",
