      "content": "Sadly, there hasn't been a lot of good research into which typefaces and sizes are best for low vision. However, the research that does exist suggests that type size and text design choices are more critical than the typeface choice. Considering issues of colour contrast, line length, leading, and —because this is an exhibition— placement of text in the environment will make a larger difference to a reader than choosing Plantin over Minion.\n\nGranted, one should use a reasonable typeface for the job. Here the research that is available suggests choosing a typeface that is well spaced and on the slightly heavier side. The ADA and SEGD guidelines can help here to weed out typefaces that are too light. Doing some informal user testing will also help, especially when choosing a type-size and colour combinations.\n\nThere aren't a lot of good studies to recommend on this subject: I've looked at a lot of the research (I can give you my bibliography if you're interested) and have concluded that a lot more research needs to be done, especially research geared to giving good guidelines to working designers.\n\nI can suggest reading Alison Shaw's _Print for partial sight_. It is getting dated, but it is the best study of typeface and type size for low vision. This isn't to say that it is perfect, but it is the most comprehensive study to date. You could also look at the research of the [Minnesota Laboratory for Low-Vision Research](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033259/http:/vision.psych.umn.edu/~gellab/). It's some of the best work being done currently, but it is aimed at optometrists. Lastly, [Zoe L. Strickler](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033259/http:/www.chip.uconn.edu/people/profile%20pages/pe_zoestrickler.htm) has done some interesting research (published in _Visible Language_) in designing interactive systems for older adults and low vision. Though it is about interaction design, it does say a lot about design in general for low vision and older adults.\n\nHope that helps, and isn't too much.\n\n**References**  \nShaw, A.

(Visit the link and take the little decoding test to give you a sense of what dyslexic readers go through.)\n\nMy wife also happens to work for [The Landmark School](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033259/http:/www.landmarkoutreach.org/res_e_faq.htm) which is one of the best known private educational facilities for children with reading and learning disorders. Of what I know of their mission is that they are training the students to decode and reprocess information encountered in their daily lives.\n\nThrough my wife, I have recently contacted Landmark to see if I could participate in or contribute to the school's art program (all of their teachers are required to have Masters in Special Education). I have been toying with the idea of letterform collages, innovative calligraphy and found object alphabets (inspired by both Nick Shinn and [Clotilde Olyff](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033259/http:/www.dorpdal.com/lettered/pebble1.html)). In that way it would just be the joy of shapes and recognized individual forms as art, and not for reading comprehension.\n\nSo many ideas, so little time... (at least another 50 years I hope).\n\n"

But how to do it?.\n\nFor seniors (older adults) current recommendations vary... The common denominator seems to be to recommend the use sans serif typefaces in large sizes (e.g.: type for reading on screen ~14pt). I can't imagine what to do in large format graphic panels (and here ADA can provide some guidelines). Although it seems to contradict the maxim of \"we read best what we read more\", I think the sans serif recommendation is due to the fact that sans serif typefaces may help increase the white space and avoid unnecessary visual clutter (without dismissing the serifs' function, though).\n\nAlthough older adults aren't necessarily people with disabilities, low vision, speed of reading and cognition problems come with age (and yes... many of us will suffer from most of these!):\n\n> \"Of people aged ≥ 70 years, 18% report blindness in 1 or both eyes or some other trouble seeing, 33.2% report problems with hearing, and 8.6% report problems with both hearing and seeing.1 Precisely because these experiences are so common, they are often overlooked or dismissed.2 Moreover, normal age-related changes in hearing and vision may be con- fused with abnormal sensory changes that can compromise function. Likewise, abnormal changes due to eye and ear pathology may be confused with normal age-related sensory changes.\"  \n> [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.94.5.823](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033259/http:/ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.94.5.823 \"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.94.5.823\")\n\nAnd it's not exclusive to US Older Adults.

Although it's not enough by itself, science can play a role in anything (even mixing paint for abstract art).

I've already added your website to my reading list ;)  \n——\n\nNick:  \nLet me agree and disagree. When you have a design brief, sure you have to make and educated, aesthetic-based decision. We do it all the time. We evaluate the client and research the target audience, we evaluate and research the contents and we prototype the design. We can even test the result sometimes. I'm with Hrant this time: sure this is not a laboratory, but this uses a very similar process, don't you agree?\n\nMany, many factors taken into account in this process are also some kind of science. You know that choosing a typeface will change the reading speed, the white space, the copy structure/hierarchy, etc... If you do it more intuitively, or more scientifically... well I thinks its up to each one of us.\n\n> For low vision readers, the trick is to make the type large while retaining a certain amount of grace in the layout.\n\nCouldn't agree more! See below my first attempt to try to compile a recommendation list.\n\n——  \nAbout these papers/researches, I keep struggling with some things like the methods and results they provide. Some are really contradictory to my experience/design education. For example, quoting the abstract from Psychophysics of Reading:\n\n> Data were collected using versions of the MNREAD Acuity Chart printed with the Times (proportionally spaced) and Courier (fixed-width) fonts.\n\nWith this, they cant test vision acuity (AKA legibility?) regarding the selected typeface (no doubt here). But they provide reading speed results... also with a MNREAD chart? Of course they found something we already know for users with normal vision:\n\n> Maximum reading speeds for normal subjects were 5% faster with Times than with Courier (P \\< 0.001), but for subjects with low vision, maximum reading speeds were 10% slower with Times than with Courier (P \\< 0.05). [...] For normal subjects, the differences are slighter, with an advantage in reading speed for Times. However, for print sizes close to the acuity limit, choice of font could make a significant difference in both normal and low-vision reading performance.\n\nMy problem with these is that they fail to present the samples used for testing. This is a matter also raised by Albert Jan-Pool at ATypI in Dublin during one presentation.\n\nAnd, whenever they provide them, the testing materials are poorly designed. No wonder the results are what they are... remember this one: [http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Diemand-Yauman\\_Oppenheimer\\_...](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033259/http:/web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Diemand-Yauman_Oppenheimer_2010.pdf \"http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Diemand-Yauman\\_Oppenheimer\\_2010.pdf\")\n\n"

Typeface:  \n 1a) sans serif;  \n 1b) legible: high x-height, wide horizontal proportions, pronounced extenders, pronounced/disctinct finishing strokes and crossbars, open counters, consistent low modulation strokes, distinct glyph set (\\*1);  \n 1c) large body (\\*2);  \n 1d) use the minimum number of fonts possible;  \n 1e) roman-regular type style (\\*8);  \n 1f) avoid decoration (\\*6);  \n 1g) Use of Sentence or Mixed Case forms;\n2. Spacing and alignment (in comparison to normal vision reader materials);  \n 2a) wider letter spacing;  \n 2b) increased line height;  \n 2c) increased spacing on images, graphics and page layout elements (gutters, margins, etc) (\\*3);  \n 2d) Left-hand alignment;\n3. Structure of the text:  \n 3a) clear contrast between structure/functions like headings, subheadings, lead, body, captions, etc (\\*7);  \n 3b) smaller, or more separated units of text (\\*4) (\\*8);  \n 3c) use structures like bullet lists, or boxes to highlight, or separate (\\*8);\n4. Color:  \n 4a) bright, avoiding low saturation, or vibrant (\\*5);  \n 4b) dark on light (AKA, black type on white backgrounds);  \n 4c) avoid reverse outs and background patterns;\n\nThe problem is that this is an interdependent variable system... Some of these are really simple science/lab tested result based decisions (like 1a). Others... well...\n\n——  \nNotes:\n\n(\\*1) We know what is constitutes a legible typeface (see the literature here, or start with this one: [http://www.aiga.org/typography-and-the-aging-eye/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033259/http:/www.aiga.org/typography-and-the-aging-eye/ \"http://www.aiga.org/typography-and-the-aging-eye/\"). But what should we use and how to test the different selected options on a screen prototype? APHont, or Tiresias seem like viable candidates, but really, Verdana is a time tested, master designed typeface.\n\n(\\*2) For print sizes, recommendations vary a bit, but seem to be between 12 and 14 pt for body size. On screen, what should we use?\n\n(\\*3) Agelight proposes: \"It is suggested you leave a wide margin of 1 1⁄2 or more inches on the right side of the page to maximize usability with different monitor types, window sizes and display resolutions.\"  \nIt's a bit outdated...\n\n(\\*4) Agelight proposes: \"Short pages, those containing one or two screens of text, work well for the homepage and menu pages when users are scanning for informational links. Longer pages, although they require more scrolling, may work well for destination pages where related content can be printed and read/scanned together. Avoid creating large pages with multiple articles and links. Break topics down into succinct pages for usability and printing.\"\n\n(\\*5) Agelight proposes: \"bright, fluorescence or vibrant can have edges that appear to blur and create after-images,which fatigue the eye [...] the safest colors to use are black, white, blue and yellow where as red, green brown, grey and purple can be troublesome.\n\n(\\*6) From Agelight: \"Drop shadows on text, often used to give words the appearance of depth, can be difficult to decipher.\"\n\n(\\*7) Agelight & Strizver recommend body size between 12 and 14 pt. Agelight recommends titles two points larger, but I disagree. Type should be CLEARLY contrasting in size, using a rule of thumb to have a 4 pt difference step, or a 10-20% difference in size (depending on typeface and body selected).\n\n(\\*8) From Agelight: \"Limiting the use of bold to emphasize a title or a key word is recommended.\". Condensed / expanded are also not recommendable. Strivzer also adds: \"Use boldface to emphasize a word or a small group of words. Keep use of italics to a minimum; research indicates that italic type is 18 percent more difficult to read than Roman (upright) letters.\"\n\n——  \nReferences:  \n2001 - AGELIGHT - Interface design guidelines for users of all ages  \n2001 - Bernard - Liao - Mills - font type size affect reading time  \n2004 - Strizver - 26FYTIDesigningforSeniorsITC  \n2004 - University of Washington - Low Vision FAQ  \n2005 - AARP - Designing Web Sites for Older Adults - Heuristics  \n2005 - Arditi - Serifs and font legibility  \n2006 - Nini - AIGA - Typography and the Aging Eye- Typeface Legibility for Older Viewers with Vision Problems  \n2007 - Russell-Minda et al. - The legibility of typefaces for readers with low vision - a research review  \n2007 - Yaffa - The Road to Clarity  \n2008 - W3C - Web Accessibility for Older Users - A Literature Review  \n2009 - Tiresias - Fonts checklist  \n2009 - Tiresias - How to make fonts and typefaces accessible for people with disabilities  \n2009 - Tiresias - Typefaces and legibility  \n2010 - ADA Standards (Chapter 7)\n\nP..S.: Sorry Christopher... still haven't gone through your reference list, but will soon!\n\n"

It’s true, as Hrant points out, that a lot of garbage gets foisted on the public, but ultimately people will read what works best for them, and publishers facilitate that or they are out of business—although well-meaning governments can provide a bad skew by ﬁnancing wishful thinking.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nPedro, I put it to you that even your most basic “scientiﬁcally-proven” precept is incorrect. Do you really think that the Old Nicks of this world (of whom I am one) will take kindly to reading books set in sans serif, when we have been reading them set in serifed fonts all our lives? I’m not familiar with libararies in Portugal, but those I have been into elsewhere have large print sections where all the books are set in classic serifed faces. Doesn’t this suggest there is some merit in the practice?\n\nWhat happens when you age is that you have to view the text from further away, because you can no longer focus as close as you once could. This reduces type size to below the optimum arc of vision, therefore it needs to be bigger to compensate. It’s that simple! Many people slide their glasses down their nose to bring the type into focus (it’s human nature to “make do” rather than get new glasses)—but that makes the type smaller, again, not enough arc of vision.\n\nThere is also some loss of contrast due to yellowing of the lens.\n\nI’m talking about the normal deterioration of vision brought about by aging.\n\n"

My 90-year-old mother still reads standard books and magazines without difficulty, but she has a friend in her 70s with macular degeneration who is almost blind. There's not going to be a point size recommendation that's appropriate for everyone over 65.\n\nI'm all for research in this area, although I think many of the findings are largely common sense (use an easy-to-read font, bump up the point size, etc.).\n\nNot sure if this will be of any help to you, but some computer companies may have done some research on readability on monitors for folks with disabilities. For example, Apple has a page discussing some special computer settings for users with poor eyesight. Not a lot of info, but it's interesting that they have settings for making the screen high contrast and the option to reverse black and white. (I'm not even sure why reversed type would be easier for some with impaired vision to read, but apparently it is in some cases.)  \n [http://www.apple.com/accessibility/macosx/vision.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033259/http:/www.apple.com/accessibility/macosx/vision.html \"http://www.apple.com/accessibility/macosx/vision.html\")\n\n"
