I desperately need to find it. Oh, btw, I'm not looking to know the font within the frame, just basically where can I find the whole thing.  \nThanks in advance for any help!  \nJen\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [4\\_Z-300x300.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415033913/http:/typophile.com/files/4_Z-300x300.jpg) | 44.24 KB |\n\n",
