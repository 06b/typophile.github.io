I'm still not sure about the lc \"w\", but I kinda like it this way.   \n  \n ![bingo7.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143729im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1609.gif)\n\n",

Excellent \"g\". Perhaps the \"Q\" could do with a more distinctive tail. Is this standard leading or has it been increased for the demo? It looks like you could lead a little closer.\n\n"

      "content": "thanx Martin   \n   \nI understand the feelings about the \"Q\" so I tried some other ones but I didn't came up with any nicer ones, which would fit the rest of the capitals. I'll try some more later.   \nYou were right about the leading, I tend to overdo it. This time a little less.   \n   \nI made some small changes: the horizontal bar in the \"f\" moved one pixel up.   \nAnd the \"f\",\"l\" and \"t\" have a pixel less white to their rights.   \n   \n ![bingo7update.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143729im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1614.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "ok I finished the bold version so here it is.   \nI think it's primary use should be in titles etc. Not for large bodies of text.   \n   \n ![bingos.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143729im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1621.gif)   \n   \nI ofcourse apologize for the strange text. When you finaly manage to think of a text containing all the letters. It turns out to be a rather strange one.\n\n"
