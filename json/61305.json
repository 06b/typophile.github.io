  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm currently working up a nameplate for a student magazine. The magazine features mostly news features and opinion and will be published four times in the academic year. The magazine is reasonably high-brow and serious, but with a student focus. Anyway, for the nameplate/flag/logo/wordmark, I drew on inspiration from the [New York Magazine's nameplate](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014221406/http:/images.nymag.com/gfx/sect/home/logo.gif).\n\nWith some help from the Type ID board here, I settled on Bellevue. There are some really beautiful swashes in Bellevue, but unfortunately the M doesn't have any. So I'd like to butcher some of the swashes from other characters and Frankenstein them onto the M.\n\nIn the attached image, from top to bottom: Unaltered, first version, second version. I like that there's more to the second version, but with scaling the swashes up and down I feel the scale and weight of the strokes have suffered. Any help appreciated!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Cover.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014221406/http:/typophile.com/files/Cover_0.png) | 13.56 KB |\n\n",
