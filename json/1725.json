I think it's a lot better than the sans serif faces that some companies use for long copy, but if there are other suggestions, I'll hear them.   \n   \nPaul\n\n",

It'll mostly be used for corporate brochures, fact sheets, and short newsletters.   \n   \nMy icon appreciates the compliment, Stephen.   \n   \nPaul\n\n"

I love the italic k.   \n   \nBut I recently used it for a project and the roman turned out a little light even though I printed on uncoated stock.   \n   \nThe printer's \"inkjet\" proofs were lovely though.   \n   \nI don't think I'll ever understand printing. I thought the uncoated paper would make it nice and earthly. It wasn't that thin a font to begin with.   \n   \nAnyone know why this happens?\n\n"

I've run 4 color on a linen finish paper and the ink sits right on top like a coated paper. Why because when you make Linen finished paper they press the finish between two drums and create a hard surface.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> the hardness of the uncoated paper   \n?   \n   \n I don't understand. I thought uncoated paper absorbs more ink than coated stock and so has a larger dot gain which would translate to heavier (than usual) font.   \n   \nIs uncoated paper harder than coated ones then? It's counter-intuitive.\n\n"

      "content": "Luc(as) de Groot designed TheAntiqua because he was   \nappalled at how often he saw TheSerif used for long text.   \n   \nBut I used TheSerif as the text font for 4 years in a student   \nmagazine and it worked very well. The rag was printed on   \nbad newsprint so it performed better than most types   \nwould. Maybe if the company you're working for is printing   \na lot of glossy stuff it might be too stark, but I wouldn't   \nflatly recommend against it. It depends more on the   \npersonality of the company.   \n   \nBut give TheAntiqua and PMN Caecilia a try.   \n   \nYour user icon is very pretty, btw, PD.\n\n"
