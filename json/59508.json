  "content": "Dear typophiles,  \nI'm looking for an ID on the grotesk typeface in the following two pictures. It is used by Fogal, a Swiss stockings company, for their packaging. I doubt that they'd have a custom typeface, but maybe that's the solution.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301193354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fogal_caresse_5726.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301193354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fogal_madison_6142.jpg)\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",

There are a lot of weights and variations in the complete Neutraface superfamily. With a bit of graphic manipulation I am sure you could come very close, if not an exact match.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
