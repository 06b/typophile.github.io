  "content": "Hi guys\n\nWhen printing on paper, I use points spec everything, such as my baseline grids, leading, etc.\n\nHowever, now that I'm working on a signage project, the contractors require me to spec everything in millimetres — such as the cap height, margins and so on because it would not make sense for them to measure something that is \"4.1574931 mm\" or anything like that.\n\nDoes this mean I should use millimetres for everything now? Such as margins, leading, baselines grids? How will it affect the overall aesthetic? Would using millimetres for leading go against any typographic best practices?\n\nWould be great if anyone could share how they set up their canvas. Any insight would be great!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

      "content": "I don’t know about signage, but I set up all my DTP documents using millimetres: since I start with paper sizes expressed in mm (usually A4, 210×297mm) I find much easier setting a grid (margin, columns, baseline, etc.), it greatly simplifies any calculation involved. The rest is eye ;)\n\n"

Just design the signage as you wish and then convert the measurements.\n\n"
