  "content": "This headline style was established by M/M from Paris. They said the following about the redesign of Vogue's typography, but I can't see that this is one of those typafes:\n\n> The foundation of Paris Vogue’s redesign is a new typographic system. Using Gerard Unger’s Paradox for body copy and the 18th-century Fleischmann for stand-firsts, M/M adopted a rough-edged schoolbook typeface for headlines (a face they named Gulliver after the subject of the book) and employ one of their own existing designs (now called Carine) to title fashion spreads.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419154136im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-12-29%20at%2020_5005.10.39.png)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Carine by M/M \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [sebastianhilgetag](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419154136/http:/typophile.com/user/225247 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
