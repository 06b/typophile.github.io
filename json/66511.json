  "content": "Hello all!\n\nSo I lost a font, and now I want to recreate the image I created with it, and I can't find it.\n\nI built a basic \"logo\" using some font that is remarkably similar to \"Grotesque\" and used it on a website. Now that I want to use it again, BOTH remote .PSD files are corrupt AND my local .PSD is corrupt, so I can't access the file to determine what font it is.\n\nI have over 1500 fonts and I've spent about 2 hours looking through them and nothing fits.\n\nI've attached the ONLY sample text I have for it. I know it's minimal, but maybe someone knows what it is.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-rockerest\n\nEDIT:  \nNotice the vertical bars on the parentheses. I have not yet seen a font that has both these vertical bars (versus continuous curves) and the inward facing stroke ends on the parentheses (versus upwards or diagonal stroke ends).\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20120730063553/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_11.png) | 5.22 KB |\n\n",

I can't believe I did that, and with that knowledge, I figured out that the bracket font is [Atilla](http://web.archive.org/web/20120730063553/http:/bayfonts.com/atilla-normal-p-170.html), while the \"t\" font is Arial, as you said.\n\nI'm kicking myself hard about the bracket/parentheses thing. Thanks again for your help.\n\n-rockerest\n\n"
