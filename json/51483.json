  "content": "This demi roman text font was used from the teens through the thirties on the piano roll labels of Rythmodik and then Ampico in NYC and Rochester. It bears many similarities to more common fonts, but I have been casually searching without success since about 1960. Unfortunately, the lc examples are mostly in about 8pt and get blobby.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207122610im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ampico300_4757.gif)\n\n [‹ (x) \"Stubb's Bar-B-Q\" faceted slab serif by Decoder - Ironmonger {Yves}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207122610/http:/typophile.com/node/51485 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [swashes and flourishes from which font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207122610/http:/typophile.com/node/51457 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
