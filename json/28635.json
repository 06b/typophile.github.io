(A little CSS goes a long way.) We're working on some additional features like RSS and referral tracking, and we're still plugging away with the content. More specimens and downloadable PDFs are in the works, so bookmark us or create an account to receive announcements.\n\nSome new fonts are up. [Chris Dickinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223458/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=Nw==) has given us two brand new exclusive humanist sans families: [Alber](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223458/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MjI1) and [Depot](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223458/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MjM0). We've got more from [Dino dos Santos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223458/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=Mw==) (DSType). I've regenerated his new OTFs to group by family -- a vital convenience in my opinion. [Ryoichi Tsunekawa](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223458/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=OA==) (Flat-It) has joined and has a lineup of exclusives on the way. [Neil](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223458/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=Mg==) teamed up with [Anuthin Wongsunkakon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223458/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=NA==) to put the finishing touches on [PennStation](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223458/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=Mjgz)... an intricate LED style headline. Neil has also been quite busy. Several of his OTF rereleases are now available.\n\nFeedback is much appreciated. Let us know what features you'd like to see and whether you stumble over any quirks that need fixing. Just shoot us your 2 cents through our contact form. Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "It's a great design; almost entirely functional, it renders quickly and lets the type stand out, with just a little hint of decoration to keep the header from looking boring.\n\nBy the way, Depot is so pretty it hurts to look at. That one's going on my list of fonts to buy when I'm not living on student loans!\n\n"

I just bought it a couple of weeks ago and a family list would be helpful to say the least considering how many OT features it has.\n\nBTW, I love your type and love your site. I also love the prices! Very reasonable for us working designers. I will be building a library from Type Trust for sure.\n\n"
