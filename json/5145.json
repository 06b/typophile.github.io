I did a digitization of China for a client in the late eighties. I got a lot of queries about it since I show it in my custom fonts section on my site and decided to do my own version of it which became Changeling. A lot of elements from that early type design ended up in Changeling. The other stuff you allude to (Coquette, etc.) is where my head is at now after thinking about type for 20 or 30 years. Changeling is me reverting to what I thought was cool when I was just starting out.\n\n"
