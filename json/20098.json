  "content": "Hi, I’m relatively new to publishing and not as expert in typography as I’d like.\n\nI’m attaching a few pages from a forthcoming book, which I would love to have critiqued — please tell me how bad it looks, and what would make it better :)\n\nThe book is currently set in 10.5pt Adobe Garamond (AGaramond), with initial letters of chapters in 20pt Christensen Caps.\n\nThe book is an epic fantasy novel originally published in 1825. It currently runs about 450 pages. I’d like a font that’s easy on the eyes over a span of 450 pages, but not one that ends up swelling the book to 500+ pages.\n\nAny help is much appreciated!\n\n— Jay\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [magic.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20060630150536/http:/typophile.com/files/magic.pdf) | 70.41 KB |\n\n",

For the initials, try enlarging them, maybe up to 27.5pt, 34pt or maybe even 72 pt.\n\nmy little two cents.. hope it helps and good luck.\n\n"
