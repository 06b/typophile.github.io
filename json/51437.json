  "content": "Help all,\n\nI am working on a logo and I am looking to a font similar to elderkin bold.  \nElderkin has been discontinued. It looks like Helvetica Bold Condensed but it has slightly rounded corners.  \nThis gives it a punched leather/ woodcut feel.\n\nIt was used on the cover of the Annual of Type Directors Club 26.\n\nAny fonts that are similar would be great. I have a tight deadline and would prefer to not have to recreate something.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tdc26annual.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150226174303/http:/typophile.com/files/tdc26annual_0.jpg) | 39.66 KB |\n\n",
