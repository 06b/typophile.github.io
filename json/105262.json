I tried to explain what I want to do in my not-so-perfect English:\n\n[http://youtu.be/eZ3VU1xM0aI](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015160450/http:/youtu.be/eZ3VU1xM0aI \"http://youtu.be/eZ3VU1xM0aI\")\n\nYou can find the project page on the German/American crowdfunding platform startnext:\n\nIt would be very kind of you if you could imagine to become a «fan» of the projekt so that it can reach the following step – the financing phase.\n\nBest\n\nLars\n\n",
