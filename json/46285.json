The N looks like it had the curls ’grafted’ on, and for that reason I am inclined to think the initials are hand-drawn. The rest of the lettering looks like it could come from either a script font, or an italic of a serif font, but they are not distinctive enough for me to recognize them.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
