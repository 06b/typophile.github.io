  "content": "Greetings all. I am trying to find a sample of the logo/letterhead of a now-defunct grocery store chain: First National Stores. It used to be a major grocery store chain in New England and the northeast, but seems to have been bought out and buried in recent decades. I spotted this toy truck from the 1950s, but I need to see a sample of their logo from the 1920s or '30s. Anybody here ever seen it? Anybody from that part of the country who might remember it? I'd be grateful for any leads.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014015425im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FirstNatTruck_4019.jpg)\n\n",

It doesnt look like any of them reflect an actual logo, though.\n\nBut [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014015425/http:/www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/history/business/2000s/finast1920s.htm) has what looks like an old circular, from (i think it says) 1931.\n\n"
