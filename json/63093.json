At a glance, it seems a bit wider than the digital set I have.\n\nThe back cover list sure makes me drool. Must be from childhood memories, as all of these fonts were already deemed 'tacky' when I started typesetting. (Admittedly, it also could be my age.)\n\n"

Come to think of it, that goes for the entire catalog. When is the next 70s revival due?\n\n"
