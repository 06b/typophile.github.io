It should have a clean and corporate look too.\n\nThis logo is still a draft, but what do you think?  \nAny comments will be very appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080101095251im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logo-ije-20071019-02_6422.png)\n\n [‹ high end nursery in vermont](http://web.archive.org/web/20080101095251/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39077 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [A company named Techlink ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080101095251/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39037 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

What I mean is when you get a small print of logo the IJE will stand, but the other text won’t. If I were you would meke some other tests.\n\nAntónio\n\n"

Second, the line space between the bottom two lines is optically larger than between the top two lines, because there’s no ascender in “empresa” and almost no descender in “júnior”.\n\nAs a solution, I’d try shifting the words left and right a bit, until the line spaces appear somewhat evenly distributed.\n\n"

So instead of shifting the 3 words left and right, I thought of representing this idea, putting them in two lines.  \nSo that the “i” in “júnior” doesn’t collide with the “p” in “iscap”, I tried to put this text to the left of “ije”, aligned right. It’s size is bigger too, so its legibility is increased at small sizes.\n\nWhat do you think of it this way? Does it look any better?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080101095251im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logo-ije-20071025-01_5076.png)\n\n"

I think this last version IS much better than any of the previous ones.\n\nBut when I think of acronyms in logos combines with text they normally do appear as acronym on the left and text on the right. But noone says it should be this way.\n\nI like this last version. It works better in smaller sizes than previous designs.\n\nAnd BTW if nobody saw it so far: in the “ije” we have two “kids” holding their hands and facing eachother. Maybe that could be more emphasized. But the logo works at this moment already.\n\n"
