  "content": "I've been renaming and regenerating for days now. The problem I have is that Roman typefaces and their italics appear under different font menus even though the family name is exactly the same (see pic). How can I sort this and have them all appear under the same menu? I have spent enough time going round in circles getting nowhere. Why are there so many options in FontLab and no definitive solution to generating an OTF family in a range of weights?\n\nAny help much appreciated. Thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121214051823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fontmenu_4695.gif)\n\n",
