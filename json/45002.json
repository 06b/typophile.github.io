[Punchcut](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019082842/http:/www.punchcut.com/) commissioned Brent Barson and Eric Gillette for the title design on behalf of Typophile. We could not be more pleased for Brent and Eric and the students of their Visual Arts 441 / BYU class that participated. The titles opened our Typophile Film Fest 4 to a filled-to-capacity audience of 300+ attendees at TypeCon 2007 in Seattle and was shown again to a standing-room-only crowd at the Swedish American Hall in San Francisco.\n\n",
