      "content": "Soren --   \n   \nI'm not sure I understand your first question. Insignia's 'A' serif goes to the left. This is not all that uncommon (though not usually so pronounced). One could probably trace the origins of this treatment (although a different style, to be sure) back to some medieval calligraphic forms.   \n   \nBut 'A's that have a single serif to the right are going to be hard to find. Goudy did a couple designs that might qualify. Goudy's National Oldstyle has an unusual seriffy movement to the right. This face was based on lettering he did for National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) around 1900. Goudy's Pabst Oldstyle also shows a similar flourish.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
