      "content": "Lex, I think you're right. I tried it with a normal serif font at 300% the normal height, and got something very similar in shape. I wanted to try it with Perpetua, but it wasn't handy. (I think you need a typeface with a P whose bowl droops a bit after leaving the stem.)\n\nIf you don't want to play such games, [Peplum](http://web.archive.org/web/20140117164141/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/peplum/peplum/testdrive.html?s=D+E+P+T&p=72) is similar 'off the shelf'.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
