  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm pretty new to Typophile—I've been lurking around for a few months now, but would just like to say hello! I'm glad I was introduced to such a wealth of knowledge. I'm a graphic design student, and definitely have a nice big place in my heart for typography. Just can't get enough. You know how it goes...\n\nAnyway, I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I just got back from a semester in Spain, and a (design) friend I met over there told me about TipoGrafica, the Buenos Aires–based magazine. Can't believe I hadn't heard of it sooner! Anyway, so I've been reading it online for quite some time now, but can't figure out how to subscribe. Anyone know how to do so? A secret hidden link somewhere?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nCassie\n\n",
