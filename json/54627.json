  "content": "Hi guys, a client has reported a problem viewing a PDF in Acrobat 7 and 5 which was generated from InDesign CS4 (producer: Adobe PDF Library 9.0, version:1.4)and has an OTF font embedded as a subset. It views perfectly in Acrobat 9 and Apple Preview but in earlier versions of Acrobat the text displays as a series of checked rectangular boxes.\n\nDoes anyone know if this is a CS4 issue? The font embeds/views fine in earlier Acrobat versions when I test from CS2. I've left a note on the Acrobat forum but thought I'd check if any typophilers have seen anything like this.\n\nCheers,\n\nJoe\n\n",
