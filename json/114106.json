  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI've been looking for a nice serif body text that will compliment Geogrotesque. I would like something with a timeless feel, contemporary, solid, but somewhat friendly. I've been messing around with Vendetta. I've also tried Garamond ITC Pro. Since I don't have anyone I trust for their type feedback, I'm posting this here. I would love to locate something with lots of cut options moving forward. Vendetta seems to have a lot of options.\n\nAny recommendations would be awesome - thoughts on Vendetta as a complement to it would also be great. Just wondering if I'm off on that. If you all have better alternatives, I'd be very much open to exploring...\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [geogrotesque-vendetta.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420050608/http:/typophile.com/files/geogrotesque-vendetta.jpg) | 85.28 KB |\n\n",
