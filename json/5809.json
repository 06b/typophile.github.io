  "content": "Hi there, I was given the opportunity to consign some of the books from the estate of Mr. Frank Petrocelli owner of Press of the Iron Horse. A family member asked that I take care of the sale(s) of his various books regarding typography, most privately printed in limited editions. If interested you can view the collection at [www.devineconsign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525002126/http:/www.devineconsign.com/) and press on the GoAntiques links on the homepage, anything typophile related or privately printed are from his collection. SO far I have about two pages worth of his books and more to come. All offers are considered and the proceeds go back to his family. Thank you for your time and consideration.   \n   \nLaura Devine\n\n",
