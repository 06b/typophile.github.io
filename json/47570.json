Anyhows I'm doing a shot music community film project and it's with over 50s.. basically I want to make hopskotch designs on the ground, and in the squares put the text of a poem they have written... anyone know the best way to d this neatly and accuratly but very quickly, was thinking templates... where would be the best place to get these in the uk... also they have to be laregish and it must be removable.. but also anyway to do it so it looks really vibrant on film.. also any ideas for fonts that might reflect the theme of aging, but also games and fun and yoouth lost.. thanks for any help in advance..all the best.\n\n",
