The idea that the 'edge effect' intensifies both the white and black near a stroke. I think I read this also in G. Noordzij, but here it is applied in a practical way. I realize it is closely related to what we here on Typophile have debated about 'notan'.\n\n2. Unger's characteristic handling of the mn branches is partly due to a theory that bigger counters will intensify contrast, making the blacks more forceful.\n\n3. The observation that Newspaper type has become progressively bigger and narrower over the past 15 years.\n\nI wonder, how much was the book updated from previous Dutch editions?\n\n"

When I saw it at TypeCon I just bought it and canceled my order with Amazon.\n\nI'm sure that the publisher will get a bigger cut if you order directly from them, but not necessarily the author. The basic author percentage is I believe usually based on retail price. But if Amazon negotiates a reduced price from the publisher, then it may reduce the cut to the author, depending on how the contract is written...\n\n"

I've had Unger's book for over a month and have been remiss in completing my reviews.\n\nBesides, my reviews (plural, one for design/typographic readers and one for general readership) are more focused on Unger's research, views and speculation on readability and user experience.

I know it’s convenient, but if you want the book quickly and want to suppport the publisher/author, get it from the source!\n\nBuying from Amazon will not short the author ... unless the book is remaindered ... then the author gets diddly. I suppose some small publishers prefer to sell direct, but most of the biggies look at single sales as a nuisance, and prefer to sell to distributors and larger retailers, who get their own cut, but handle all the small sales.\n\nSome publishers won't even sell to small bookstores, let along end users.\n\n"
