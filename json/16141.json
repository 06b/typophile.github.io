They list your product for you on multiple engines and manage the whole process from listing to shipping (focus: large clients with lots of products)\n\nI am looking for recommendations for a typeface that will be used next to a mark and in text on their collateral materials (For the mark, we're going for something kind of like a DNA strand - semi-scientific feel but still ultra hip)\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",

Ultra Cool seems to be grungy (I could be wrong) and Scientific seems to be on the Eurostyle feel all lower case (but I could be wrong again). I would go another direction all together, I would explore a unique mark that was not plugged into a category.\n\n"

Maybe these thoughts will help (I appreciate the discussion by the way, this is really helping).\n\nI wouldn't say grungy for \"Cool\" maybe a better word would be \"hip\". They want to use orange as their main accent color. This color to me puts them in the \"Dot Com\" arena. They actually are a dot com, but they want to move out of that area a little bit while still keeping the edgy dot com \"hip\" factor. Throw in a slice of scientific and we have a real Frankenstein don't we?\n\n"
