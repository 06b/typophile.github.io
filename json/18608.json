I did find a post on these forums from a couple of years back on it, but nothing else. I’m guessing it used to go by the name Modular Bold, but the font that comes up by that name in Google searches bears no resemblence. It was owned by NovelFonts.\n\nDoes anyone know where I can get a copy of this font these days? Or even a relatively decent proxy?\n\nThanks in advance,  \nTom\n\n [‹ Need id help in two fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080107113226/http:/typophile.com/node/18610 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Sutera Medical Spa logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080107113226/http:/typophile.com/node/18612 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
