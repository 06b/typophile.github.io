  "content": "I've finally released the free (as in beer) version of !Disc Inferno, despite Luc crediting me for it months ago. This features the first 200 of the 1300 glyphs or so, meaning no international scripts, swatches or other such goodies. I've incorporated the feed back from mentioning this previously, but now you can look at a fuller map, or download and play with it.\n\nParticularly, I'm interested in people's impressions on the relationship of x-height to overall size. However, I look forwards to your thoughts and comments in general, as I work on to release the very expanded version in 1Q07.\n\nDL available @:  \n [http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/11970?text=Quick%20Brown%20Fox](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.abstractfonts.com/font/11970?text=Quick%20Brown%20Fox)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dididididi_4964.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "It's very 'rollerball'. What about softening up the curves so they are bigger? Especially on the inside of shapes. But in general too. What about opening up the spaces slighly - between shapes inletters and between letters too. I think these changes would make the face more accessible. I don't know that that's your goal, but...\n\n"

Readability is desirable, but not so much.\n\nAfter I build the skeleton of the OpenType feature set, I plan to run out a few iterations, including one with larger (and interior) curves.\n\n[Choz Cunningham](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.exclamchine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"

Intended uses could be for sci-fi posters, retro geek-chic material, or just for where one wants to inject a funky in-yo-face look.\n\nThe original hand-lettering this was built from was actually created just before Mechanical Animals was released, but the album's spirit matched well, and a recent listening helped inspire the overall look. Also, I did make a point of looking closely at my own bookshelf to make sure !Disc Inferno brought a far more modern look than a 30 year revival would have.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mm%20sampler%20copy_3742.jpg)\n\n[Choz Cunningham](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.exclamchine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"

I think it is this:\n\nI enjoy not only the connotation, but I also enjoy the details, when I look at an entire word. However, any more than one word, and the legibility seems to drop. A lot. Why, if we read by word shape? Should the leading or the size of the space be altered? Is there a way to get a flow between words that is as fun as that between letters?\n\nI guess what I am looking for is a critique of metrics, not glyphs.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hownowbrowncow_6389.jpg)\n\n[Choz Cunningham](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.exclamchine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"

      "content": "I bet even a small increase in interletter spacing would pay. What if you got rid of the diagonals? They seem arbitrairy ( except in the case of the Cap N) and are probably not helping the face to read. Instead, I think probably distract. You could add them to glyphs where you expect them like with the K. Or eliminate them altogether. What happens if you make the heavy area swith sides & be on the left? What if you drop the middle of the W? What if all the forms were based on lower case? There is more variety of form there. What if some of the shapes were based on unical?\n\n"

And then I felt a couple more helped them get on with the more angular shapes.\n\nI suspect that your assessment on the outer curves is right. I blurred some text and it helped. I haven't experimented with the inter-letter spacing, yet. If it works, I can't yet imagine why (not that I won't try it anyhow).\n\nThe thick strip on the left is harder to read for some reason. Shorter mid-W is a winner.\n\nI think uncial letters would complicate the font too much, if I am imagining them correctly. Might try that last. :)\n\n[Choz Cunningham](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.exclamchine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417130550/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"
