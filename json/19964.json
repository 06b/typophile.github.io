So the title is changed to something useful like “J-Crew headline”\\*. And then, when some member ID’d the requested font he gets the credits like “Joanna {Yves}” (Joanna is the fontname, Yves the IDer). So when the case is closed it gets an (x) at the beginning.\n\nThank you dear cleaning staff, makes it so much easier here.\n\nEDIT: Sorry SuperUltraFabulous, wasn’t meant to insult, it was just meant as an example. Just to clear some things for Track & Kern\n\n"
