  "content": "Hi I'm looking for some suggestions.\n\nI've been searching for an appropriate serif to use for my personal identity / branding (graphic designer). As such I'm quite picky, especially when it comes to type faces.\n\nMuch to my shame, I very much like the majority of Georgia's letterforms and its screen appearance (it was designed for screens after all). That said I wont allow my self to use a windows default font for my personal identity. Even if no one else notices, just for my personal satisfaction.\n\nBefore I start rambling too much, I better provide an idea of what I'm looking for. The straight line ears, for example on the lower case 'g' and the cross-bar on the lower case 't' give me the shits, but other than a few niggles like that, Georgia I quite like.\n\nOther fonts I have been considering include:\n\nMrs Eaves XL - [http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=212](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201153012/http:/www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=212 \"http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=212\")\n\nI like the verticle serifs on the 'T' and the vertical legs (correct term ? I forget) of the 'M' and it looks generally pleasing. The XL weight seems to fix most of my problems I had with the origional Mrs Eaves (x height etc). Still not quite convinced yet though.\n\nBonesana Pro - [http://www.gestalten.com/fonts/detail/?id=ceaea76523135ee601232d96478400bc](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201153012/http:/www.gestalten.com/fonts/detail/?id=ceaea76523135ee601232d96478400bc \"http://www.gestalten.com/fonts/detail/?id=ceaea76523135ee601232d96478400bc\")\n\nI generally like the letter forms here but the angled serifs on the 'E' put me off a little.\n\nI'm also interested in a good range of open-type features. Partly why Mrs Eaves XL could be a good choice.\n\nCould anyone recommend some nice serifs (preferably with extensive familys etc) ?\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n",
