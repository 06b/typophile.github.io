  "content": "I thought I had seen most of the unusual characters associated with scientific publication in the 19th century but this one has got me stumped. It occurs several times at the end of sentences published in an 1829 issue of the Philosophical Magazine, and, as I haven't seen it before I am wondering if it has any significance to the text, or if it is merely typographical decoration. Could you tell me what the character is called and if it has any special meaning in its context. The attached image is a picture of the character as taken from the original printed material. The OCR program has interprted it as \"Tj\" in one place and as \"^\" in another, but I doubt this has any meaning, given that the program in use cannot reliably extract the letters ae from the character æ!\n\nhere is one excerpt from the text with my square brackets showing its positioning:  \n\"oxypetalum. E. (Acute, red and white flowered) tubo longi-  \n 4. tudine loborum acuminatorum; floribus sessilibus,  \n fructibus longitudinaliter nervato-angulatis.  \n Cactus oxypetalus. DeCand. Prod. Syst.Veg. 3. 4:70.  \n Habitat in Mexico. [HERE].\"\n\nhere is another:  \n\"Habitat in Mexico, ubi invenit Dom. Ackermann, et  \nDomino Tate multis aliis communicavit : in cujus horto  \nnunc copiose floret. [HERE].\"\n\nThe original text can be viewed at this link:  \n [http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15533177](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803003156/http:/biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15533177 \"http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15533177\")\n\nI thank you in advance for any help you may be able to give,\n\nCiao, KK.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Weird Symbol.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803003156/http:/typophile.com/files/Weird%20Symbol.JPG) | 8.24 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "And that's also the symbol for lead. But the context is about botany, where one might expect the symbols for Mars and Venus, standing for male and female flowers.\n\nSo my guess would be that the plants in question are hermaphroditic.\n\nEDIT: Looking it up, I found this:\n\n[http://bytesizebio.net/2012/03/08/the-origin-of-gender-symbols-in-biology/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803003156/http:/bytesizebio.net/2012/03/08/the-origin-of-gender-symbols-in-biology/)\n\nso if Linnaeus is being followed, those are _woody_ plants, not, as I had guessed, hermaphroditic ones.\n\n"
