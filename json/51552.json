  "content": "Hi everybody!\n\nSo... I'm currently developing a video game for this women's tackle football league, and wanted a font that had that blocky, authoritative look that you see on all the tv networks' NFL coverage... but I wanted something a little warm, too. (For lack of a better word, more _feminine_.)\n\nI couldn't find something, so last Saturday I started work on this.\n\nThe game is due out in four months, so I'm a bit pressed for time... I was wondering if anybody had comments. I think it looks a little too cartoony; it's supposed to look kind of elegant and sexy, yet blocky. Not sure what's going wrong there.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [springball.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416010205/http:/typophile.com/files/springball.gif) | 14.43 KB |\n\n",

I forgot to mention, yeah, I'm totally open to ditching my thing and going with something that's already out there, if I can embed it in a flash file.\n\n(Of course, my needs for a font are pretty limited right now; It will never be shown as big as my sample, I'd just use it for panel titles and menus and such, and it will never appear in print.)\n\nBut like most things I saw, Stainless is... a bit too sterile, I think? Severe? Having trouble articulating what I want here. Sort of something that's really classy like Aviano Sans, but with that sportsy, blocky look. Oh, and still casual somehow.\n\nPerhaps I'm being too picky.\n\nI'd actually happily go with Aviano, but I can't possibly afford the embedding license, sadly.\n\n"

I think next I'll increase the weight overall a little, and make the stress on the ovals a bit more contrasty.\n\n(On a side note, I'd actually love the challenge of banging something out on a tight deadline, so for that reason alone, I'd like to continue working on this.

I think that last one has helped a bit, though I'm still not thrilled with the r, b or k. Not sure what to do with those.\n\n"

Been cleaning up the small caps more, trying to even out the widths of everything. And I've got a few large caps.\n\nThere are a few numbers too, but they're terribly rough right now.\n\nTo my eyes this is looking pretty good, but if that statement leaves any of you scratching your heads, I'd love to know. ;)\n\n"

The ideas are not consistently carried through--eg the tapered and bent verticals on the MN aren't followed elsewhere, and even the M and N are different treatments. The weight of the horizontals seem too heavy and clunky. Compare [Armada](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416010205/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Armada/inuse) by Tobias Frere-Jones for a balanced and polished execution of a related idea. Finally, the a lot of the curves are wonky, and the tail of the Q looks way out of place.\n\n"

I actually like the A, U, V, W and Y very much, but any of the round stuff is starting to look a bit strange now that you mention it. But I can't quite see what's wrong there. I'm thinking I should have the horizontals get a little thinner in the middle to match some of those verticals. I'd actually done that very early on, and abandoned it for some reason...\n\n"

The first one was supposed to be sort of stylishly asymmetric. Guess that wasn't working. So this is a little dull, perhaps, but at least seems like a better place to be working from.\n\nI changed the horizontal curves on the O, Q, U, C and G so they get a little thinner in the middle. I think that's helped a lot; thanks for mentioning that. Also made the C more balanced top-top-bottom. Again, it was supposed to add a little character having it top heavy, and I don't think it worked.\n\nAlso worked a little on the M and N. Still not thrilled with those; I'll have to have a closer look at them.\n\nI looked closely at Armada, and I think it's been helpful... I'm finding the curves on things like the lowercase p really interesting.\n\n"

But if I'm on the wrong track, could somebody please let me know?\n\nSo I'm trying to make this look more professional, more balanced. I thought I'd start by looking at the whitespace; people at TypeCon are always talking about that. But I've never really looked at it much.\n\nI started with a redesigned R, that I'm fairly happy with (though it appears to be falling forward or something now).\n\nMy normal instinct for the P then, would be to just remove the diagonal stroke on the R. But, without that there, the bottom of the bowl of the P doesn't feel balanced anymore; the diagonal was taking up some of that whitespace there. So I made the bowl a smidge taller.\n\nHaving done that, the bowl felt a smidge too big, compared to the R.. so I made it thinner, trying to make the whitespace in the bowls similar in area, if not in shape.\n\nWith that sort of logic in mind, I've increased the width of the E to make those counters match the R, and made the F a little thinner than the E, and moved the center bar down a tiny bit.\n\nOn to the horizontal bars on the A, E, B and F. I've made those thinner; if the height of the horizontal bar on the top or bottom of the E is a particular percentance of the cap height, I figured the height of the center bar should be the around same percentage of the height between the top of the bottom bar and the bottom of the top bar... so that visually, they look the same. Just a guess, but I think that's helped.\n\nAnyway, I'm babbling. There's also a more conservative Q now, and I fixed up the S so it looks a little more balanced.\n\n"

      "content": "Way better; you're starting to get your 'type eyes' :)\n\nThe key to making it better is to study a lot of other stuff in depth.\n\nYou can start with similar stuff. Armada is good, because it's Tobias Frere-Jones, who is one of the best, even though this is relatively early in his career. [Clicker](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416010205/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Clicker)--done for TV guide on the basis of the old TV screen shape--is another to look at. Also [Eurostile](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416010205/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/eurostile/).\n\nYou probably would find useful Karen Cheng's book Designing Type, which has a lot of comparisons between the widths and proportions of the caps.\n\nThe idea of something wide, a bit squarish rounds, and somewhat Albertus serifs is fresh, I think. But you need both more consistency and better proportions to make this sing. On proportions see Cheng's book. There are no hard and fast rules, but still that will educate your eye. On consistency, I think for example the S needs to be more 'cornered' to look consistent with the rest of the face. check Armada, Clicker and Eurostile. Now the S looks like it can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up :) The D also needs to relate to the O, and currently looks like its having a severe identify crisis.\n\n"

Fonts & Logos by Doyald Young\n\nCheng's book is useful, but she doesn't really approach the subject as a type designer would--you get that from the others.\n\nFor the technical side: Learn FontLab Fast by Leslie Cabarga\n\nAnd the most helpful is studying in depth--in FontLab so you can make overlays and comparisons--other fonts you admire.\n\nAnd finally, Typophile!\n\nGood Luck :)\n\n"

That's been really helpful.\n\nHere are some disconnected notes...\n\n-Been working on the diagonals a bit. I think they're a bit more consistent now, though I'm still not happy with the K.  \n-Made the tops of the B, R and P a little curved to counteract that leaning effect.  \n-Staightened up the D.  \n-Made the U thinner, but I think I overdid it.  \n-Made the S a little more angular. I think I need to go farther with that.  \n-Made lots of changes to the overshoots and width of various things, to get things looking more consistent. I'm trying to be less rigid about the numbers and just eyeball it.\n\n"
