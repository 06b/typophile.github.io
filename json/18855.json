  "content": "hello typophiles\n\nif this thread belongs to the licensing-subforum, please move it moderators, i wasnt sure .\n\nim asking myself the following things:\n\n- i found ITC magnifico in several different stores from fontshop to fonts.com, etc.. the prices range from 30€ up to 45$ for exactly the same font.  \n- in [fontshop](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329201323/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=magnifico), there’s [one copy by ITC](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329201323/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=ITC.108270.0.0) and then there’s [one thats 8€ less](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329201323/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.106143.0.0) but appears to have exactly the same characterset - what now?  \n- the monotype/itc-shop is the only one which sells the [opentype-version](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329201323/http:/www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.aspx?PID=205028) - does anybody know if there’s any difference between the normal TT/PS-font and the OT-version? its 15$ more, so i’d only get it if it really has some “special” features.\n\ni find it very disappointing that, unlike many others, im ready to pay for fonts even if i’ll just use it in my freetime, but then i have to look around hours just to find the reseller that gives me the best price while not having exact information on different versions. or is there anything else i should take into consideration when chosing a shop? (im from switzerland if that matters..)\n\nthanks for any help! im a bit lost with this question..\n\n",

      "content": "Just like any software product, pricing will vary according to the vendor.\n\nYou’re looking at essentially the same font, available from different foundries. The Creative Alliance version was licensed from ITC by Monotype and they chose to sell it at a different price. Now that Monotype owns the ITC collection it seems strange that they still offer it through both foundries, I know.\n\nThe OpenType version is sometimes priced higher for no other reason than it offers simplicity (1 file) and cross-platformability (Mac and Windows). For some folks, this convenience is worth a few extra bucks.\n\nI understand a bit of confusion in seeing the same font data for different fees, but I have to ask: you’re spending hours to save $15? That’s not too grand a price break.\n\n"

      "content": "stephen, thanks alot for your reply and thanks for your insight on those foundry-stories.\n\nits clear to me that any vendor decides how he wants to sell and price his products, i have a business education :). what really annoys me is the fact that there’s no clear and structured information about different releases or some kind of meta-search / froogle where one could find all possible vendors for a specific font. well, maybe thats a business idea on its own :)\n\nits 30$ because its two fonts, and yes, 30$ are enough for me spend a few minutes searching - im doing an internship, not a well paid job, and afterall, this is for personal use, not for paid jobs.\n\nif there’s anybody here that knows of a even better deal than the fontshop-32$-version? im just asking, if not, i’ll probably get that one.\n\n"
