The only characters that seems odd, are the 'f' and the 'e'. The cross-stroke on the 'f' seems a bit high and the bold/heavy 'e' is starting to fill in from the interpolation.   \n   \nVery nice.\n\n"

Friendship is a virtue, an adjective.   \n   \nPlease, could you help me with the optical topics that you mention? If you want, write privately to my email.   \n   \nThanks again.\n\n<center><table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150414231901im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"LEFT\" alt=\"application/pdf\">presenta digna 2811.pdf<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150414231901/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/presenta_digna_2811.pdf\"><b>presenta_digna_2811.pdf</b></a> (109 k)</td></tr></table></center>!-/attachment-!\\>!-attachment:\\> \n"

It 'falls' to the left if you ask me.   \nThe light 'c' in your PDF looks like it is in the top and bottom a little thin compared to the other characters.   \n   \nGood luck,   \nRen\n\n"
