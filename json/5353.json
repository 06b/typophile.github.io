I notice now that you've done something similar with the descenders of **g** and **y** (is that the confusion you mention?)... Although the **y** looks like a **y** , the **g** \\*could\\* be confused with an **a** , I think...   \n   \nYou may want to try extending the **f**'s ascender and the descenders of **g** and **y**... it doesn't have to be a lot -- try making a few different versions of the **f** , for example, with varying lengths of ascender, and let your eye decide which works best. (This is a method I learned from [Briem's website](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012113631/http:/briem.ismennt.is/), and it has been of great help to me.)   \n   \nBest wishes!\n\n"
