      "content": "Globe itself has been well overused especially in logistics business. I think if you want a globe in your logo, you have a very tough job to do to make it stand out from the rest and already designed (memorable or not).\n\nsimply enter \"global logo\" into Google Image search and you'll see all those results. Many many companies use globe in some shape or form. You'll probably get something similar with other search terms as well.\n\nI don't want to say \"Forget about the globe stylisation\" I'm just saying you're in a tough place to make it work and to not look like a rip-off of some other logo. Take BT for instance. Very innovative and distinct but still \"globe\". One of the best to my idea of a great logo.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
