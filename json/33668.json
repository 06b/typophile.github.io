  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have been working on a display font based on the inscriptions I've seen on the catacombs of a church here in Porto Portugal, the \"Igreja de São Francisco\". These are painted grave inscriptions. In was interested in them because, even though they are clearly based on victorian leters, I think they may have something of portuguese (like the \"A\" or the \"R\"), or at least a unic interpretation of, may be, british influences which can be seen, for instance, in older stores, in Porto. I would like ask for your opinions on this. What do you think about these letters? Can you relate these forms to other alphabeths from the early 20th century?\n\nThanks in advanced:)\n\nHere is a pdf file:\n\n",

      "content": "Wow, these are both awesome!\n\nCatacumba One: I really like the swooping horizontal stroke-serifs of the T, E, L, Z, etc. And does Portuguese really use MB, MP, TE, HE, TU, TT ligatures? Wild. The only thing I don't like is the foot of the R -- it seems like an accident. I want it to go more horizontal at the end, or go from narrow to wide, maybe like the diagonal in the 4.\n\nCatacumba Two: I think the E and F are too narrow, and the H is too wide -- it looks like it's two letters stuck together. The tail on the R is great -- looks like a dangerous fishook. The tail on the 6 and the 9 don't match the rest of the font -- they are too geometric. Maybe make the two forked ends go in separate directions, or use a tail like that on the R. And the serifs on the 2, 3, and 7 should look like the serifs on the T.\n\nOh, and I want to see what a lowercase would look like.\n\nOverall, this looks really great!\n\n"

Make the two fonts uniwidth (each character having exactly the same set-width in each font) for extra usefulness.\n\n\\> Can you relate these forms to other alphabeths from the early 20th century?\n\nYes, I saw De Vinne in it (even before reading your mention of a timeframe).\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry Matt but the ligatures were my idea, to make the font more fun to use. The original grave inscriptions doens't have any ligatures (I think) although I have seen ligatures in stone inscriptions.  \nI know the foot of the R is very strange, it's a litle uncomfortable perhaps, but it caught my eye since the first time I saw it, I don't know where it came from. Thanks for your comments they will be very helpfull.  \nAbout the font's width, I suppose I'll have to something about it, because my idea was to make two mixable fonts, and the uniforming the widths woud help.\n\n"
