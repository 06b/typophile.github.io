These are structurally humanist, but simplified and regularized so that they are somewhere between humanist and grotesque or straight-sided.

Franklin Gothic-esque vs Helvetica-esque? I guess I could say my problem is that I see the difference in a histortical context. For example, the earlier english/american grotesques with the binocular g and the usually higher stroke modulation vs the newer german grotesques with the monocular g and the usually monoline strokes.\n\nSorry if this doesn't make sense, it's a little late in the morning!\n\n"

In my opinion, DIN and Conduit could be pretty safely classified as Grotesques... The same applies to the _Spiekersans's_, despite their being, well, slightly humanized.\n\n"

I can’t see how they could be grotesque.</cite>\n\nIn my opinion, _proportions_, which are the primary classifiable features, of 'Meta & Friends' place them firmly in the Grotesque Sans category. Those are the 'Modern' (Didone) proportions: slightly narrowed (round shapes based on oval, not on circle), more uniform glyph widths. However, the _open counters_ for shapes like C, G, S, a, c, e, and s are definitely 'Old-Style', and that—secondary classifyiable—feature relegates them to the Humanist Sans category (which also includes Gill Sans, Frutiger, Eras, Flora, Verdana, etc.). That is why I think that the _Spiekersans’s_ are actually Grotesques, albeit slightly humanized.\n\n"
