Three or four? Is there a standard, or is it a typographical decision left up to the writer?\n\n",

Printing 250 The first word of a new paragraph..is commonly put in Small Capitals...

Ibid. 386 Others are so sententious in their writing that they break off almost at every place that will admit of a Full-point.\n\n( The whole work 'The history and art of printing' 1771 is available for full, free access at [http://books.google.com/books?id=kkI5AAAAMAAJ](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416221027/http:/books.google.com/books?id=kkI5AAAAMAAJ \"http://books.google.com/books?id=kkI5AAAAMAAJ\") )\n\n~  \nIt would seem that that versions of small-caps openings predate contemporary usage, and that they may have exceeded its scope.\n\nAlthough I haven't undertaken any systematic research of the matter, bert\\_vanderveen's guess seems a good one: Makes sense. Also, the large opening letter for chapters and stories used to be more common at the same time that small-caps usage seems to have been more common.\n\nI think jim\\_rimmer's remark is dead-on, although aesthetically, I think there are pros and cons to a large leading letter with caps, or even a caps-only leader, under a chapter number and possibly title, graphic, et cetera. But more on chapter-openings later.\n\nThe convention of the large opening letter seems to be waning. Its primary use (that I've seen) now in modern print is mostly in a stylistic old-timesy manner in fantasy, romance, or other novels, or memoirs, or in print or online periodicals, e.g. The Economist, where a large opening capital (sometimes a non-type graphic) helps to balance the page. (Images or cartoons are often located in the bottom center or on the right margin of the page.)\n\nAlthough I'm sure the large opening letter is used in all sorts of books still in print -- usually with a short small-cap clip (I think about 3 words is most common.) -- it's worth noting that the small-caps opening of a paragraph seems to have taken on a new, or perhaps, depending upon the intention and context of the Luckombe quote, a revived usage: namely, that of accentuating sectional gaps (rather than toning down or making more palatable the accentuation accomplished by large opening letters). In a variety of books and other applications, small-caps leaders of three or four words are used to open a new section within the same chapter, essay, story, or article. In some books, these small-caps leaders are accompanied by minor or major leading letters, but generally they're not; and the distinctiveness of the usage can be seen from alternative methods used to achieve it, now. The same sort of sectional break is in other texts accomplished under bolded/italicized/underlined/small-capped/all-capped/imagized headings, etc; via demarcation of the text into section boxes or broken columns; or using stars, lines, asterisks, or other type/graphics above the first line of the new section, often centered in the page, or even left of (and separate from) the opening line.\n\nIn this manner, the small-caps lead-in has developed (or recovered, or enriched) a significant usage apart from that of chapter openings. There may even be a case for using small-cap lead-ins in a book, for instance, but not in chapter openings, only in sectional breaks. The practical effect of caps lead-ins, I would argue, is two-fold: (1) It accentuates the beginning of a description by providing a pause for the reader, along with a (sub)conscious realization that a new string of narrative or exposition is to begin. This provides the opportunity to recollect one's wits, take a sip of water, adjust one's glasses, change postures, reconsider the just-finished portion of text... the day... the weather... the birds... the time. It provides a firmer version of what the sentence, and particularly the paragraph, provides: a chance to get out, or at least pause.\n\n(2) It gives the caps-rendered words a sort of unique definition. Whereas prose is metered in word, phrase, sentence, and paragraph, in verse every word or sequence of two or more words is arguably imbued with pregnant meaning. Ambiguous syntax, line construction, and punctuation in poetry intensify this effect. A portion of prose may be said to hint severally at various interpretations, but the confines of Standard English syntax greatly reduce any actual uncertainty as to what the primary surface meaning of a given utterance is. Likewise, although punctuation, sentence configuration, word selection and arrangement, et cetera, can amplify or dampen verbal turns in the phrase, it is ultimately the reader's own apprehension of the text and internal rendering that defines the cadence of a passage read. Spoken aloud, a text may recover some of the multiplicity and uncertainty of verse, but only a portion. I would argue that the caps-rendered lead-in performs a sort of poetic, focusing function. It renders the first few, seemingly random, words of the passage apart, now, like a line or an artificial phrase. Even if the format is applied after-the-fact, of a later decision, still the delineation of lines in this fashion is certain to draw out some ubiquitous moments in the text. But if the author composes with an eye to the structure to begin with... surely (s)he is offered therein a unique, unobtrusive thrust of poetic verve to begin her prose. The focusing effect of opening caps can be seen in the reference of old (un)numbered poems, or new ones, according to the first full line, phrase, or opening words of the poem, or in the manner in which news stories or mimetic forms sometimes begin LOCATION: SPECIFIC LOCATION. TIME. Et cetera. It sets the scene.\n\nNow, fan though I clearly am of small-caps intros, I have a caveat: I'm not sure that they do more good than harm, in the opening of a chapter or (sometimes) a piece. Already the reader is outside of the text, having just finished a chapter, or another article, or another activity -- maybe a phone call. Does the reader need to be reminded: 'OK, you're about to plunge into this! OK.' I don't think so. Among sections, the interest built and maintained in the previous section keeps up the momentum of the read and encourages the reader to carry forward. The reader is also reassured by regular (though not flippant or excessive) sectional breaks: 'OK', if I need to go get something to drink/pick up the kids/answer the door/move the laundry/check on the chicken/catch the next bus/etc etc... I can do it at the next break.' But beginning a chapter, book, or long article... the first introductory phrase, stark in caps and fanfare, implies the ENTIRE endeavor of the WHOLE READ! 'I don't know if I have time to be starting War and Peace, I have to be sure dinner's ready by 5...' And whereas the phrase-making of the intro-caps lead-in, underlining in modest poetry the composed nature of the work, mid-thrust, at the beginning of a great reading endeavor surely such a reminder is more jarring and unsettling, than conspiratorial. The reader knows it all already. She doesn't want to be reminded. Don't give her extra excuses. Don't dredge up her fears and anxieties and hit her over the head with COMMITMENT! Ease 'er into it. I say: cap your sections; ease your chapters. But that's just me.\n\n"

      "content": "(edit)\n\nThe OED (sententious, a.) cites Luckombe, Philip — [A concise history of the origin and progress of printing (anon.) 1770  \n—ed. 2, entitled The history and art of printing 1771]:\n\n1771 LUCKOMBE Hist. Printing 250 The first word of a new paragraph..is commonly put in Small Capitals... But this rule may be very well laid aside in matter which is too sententious and which would take up more Small Capitals than an ordinary..Fount could supply. Ibid. 386 Others are so sententious in their writing that they break off almost at every place that will admit of a Full-point.\n\n( The whole work ’The history and art of printing’ 1771 is available for full, free access at [http://books.google.com/books?id=kkI5AAAAMAAJ](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416221027/http:/books.google.com/books?id=kkI5AAAAMAAJ \"http://books.google.com/books?id=kkI5AAAAMAAJ\") )\n\n~  \nIt would seem that that versions of small-caps openings predate contemporary usage, and that they may have exceeded its scope.\n\nAlthough I haven’t undertaken any systematic research of the matter, bert\\_vanderveen’s guess seems a good one: \"I think the idea behind using sc’s after an initial is that the contrast between an initial (dropped or raised) and lowercase following that is somewhat harsh…\" Makes sense. Also, the large opening letter for chapters and stories used to be more common at the same time that small-caps usage seems to have been more common.\n\nI think jim\\_rimmer’s remark (\"Using a two, three, or even four word small cap lead-in tends to give one a little more to work with in setting a consistent look to each chapter.\") is dead-on, although aesthetically, I think there are pros and cons to a large leading letter with caps, or even a caps-only leader, under a chapter number and possibly title, graphic, et cetera. But more on chapter-openings later.\n\nThe convention of the large opening letter seems to be waning. Its primary use (that I’ve seen) now in modern print is mostly in a stylistic old-timesy manner in fantasy, romance, or other novels, or memoirs, or in print or online periodicals, e.g. The Economist, where a large opening capital (sometimes a non-type graphic) helps to balance the page. (Images or cartoons are often located in the bottom center or on the right margin of the page.)\n\nAlthough I’m sure the large opening letter is used in all sorts of books, still, in print — usually with a short small-cap clip (I think about 3 words is most common.) — it’s worth noting that the small-caps opening of a paragraph seems to have taken on a new, or perhaps, depending upon the intention and context of the Luckombe quote, a revived usage: namely, that of accentuating sectional gaps (rather than palliating the (over-)accentuation accomplished by large opening letters). In a variety of books and other applications, small-caps leaders of three or four words are used to open a new section within the same chapter, essay, story, or article. In some books, these small-caps leaders are accompanied by minor or major leading letters, but generally they’re not; and the distinctiveness of the usage can be seen in alternative methods used to achieve it, now: the same sort of sectional break is in other texts accomplished under bolded/italicized/underlined/small-capped/all-capped/imagized headings, etc; via demarcation of the text into section boxes or broken columns; or using stars, lines, asterisks, or other type/graphics above the first line of the new section, often centered in the page, or even left of (and separate from) the opening line.\n\nIn this manner, the small-caps lead-in has developed (or recovered, or enriched) a significant usage apart from that of chapter openings. There may even be a case for using small-cap lead-ins in a book, for instance, but not in chapter openings, only in sectional breaks. The practical effect of caps lead-ins, I would argue, is two-fold: (1) They accentuate the beginning of a description by providing a pause for the reader, along with a (sub)conscious realization that a new string of narrative or exposition is to begin. This provides the opportunity to recollect one’s wits, take a sip of water, adjust one’s glasses, change postures, reconsider the just-finished portion of text... the day... the weather... the birds... the time. It provides a firmer version of what the sentence, and particularly the paragraph, provides, more generally: a chance to get out, or at least to pause.\n\n(2)The usage imbues the caps-rendered words with a sort of a sort of unique definition. Whereas prose is metered in word, phrase, sentence, and paragraph, in verse every word or sequence of two or more words is arguably imbued with pregnant meaning. Ambiguous syntax, line construction, and punctuation in poetry intensify this effect. A portion of prose may be said to hint severally at various interpretations, but the confines of Standard English syntax greatly reduce any actual uncertainty as to what the primary surface meaning of a given utterance is. (Puns are clearly the exception, rather than the rule.) Likewise, although punctuation, sentence configuration, word selection and arrangement, et cetera, can amplify or dampen verbal turns in the phrase, it is ultimately the reader’s own apprehension of the text and internal rendering that defines the cadence of a passage read. Spoken aloud, a text may recover some of the multiplicity and uncertainty of verse, but only a portion.\n\nI would argue that the caps-rendered lead-in performs a sort of poetic, focusing function.
