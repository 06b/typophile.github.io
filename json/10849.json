And I'm not sure about the \"9\". The \"a\" and \"i\" are nice, but maybe the \"r\" needs a pixel less on its right.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

This look really takes me back to the early   \nMac days of NFONTs built into apps and such.   \n(Oregon Trail, Hypercard shiz)   \n   \nThe spacing on the 'i' is a bit tight when to   \nthe left of letters like the 'l'.   \n   \nI'd chop off the last pixel on the end of the   \n'y' and 'g' tail.   \n   \nShow us the uppercasers!   \n   \nStephen\n\n"
