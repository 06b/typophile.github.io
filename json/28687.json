      "content": "Castcraft was at one time a distributor and caster of metal type. Both Monotype and foundry. Though tey had licenses to recast with European foundries, such as Stempel and Bauer, they were not that well regarded.\n\nAt some point they digitized an awful lot of these. As Paul says some of them are quite hard to find elsewhere. The problem is that these are not often the best renditions and are technically quite poor.\n\nGerald\n\n"
