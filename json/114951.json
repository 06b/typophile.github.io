  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI apologize if this has been asked and answered before but I searched for a while without coming up with any answers.\n\nI'm wondering if someone could help me find a good, readable sans-serif font that would flow nicely when inserted into body text that is composed of Adobe Garamond. Something with the same proportions so as not to cause any weird leading issues.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards,  \nChris\n\n",

You can read all about it here: [http://ilovetypography.com/2013/11/01/making-fonts-proza-typeface/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804005304/http:/ilovetypography.com/2013/11/01/making-fonts-proza-typeface/ \"http://ilovetypography.com/2013/11/01/making-fonts-proza-typeface/\")\n\nFor similar proportions you might try this: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/jannon-sans/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804005304/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/jannon-sans/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/jannon-sans/\")  \nIt's based on Jannon, rather than Garamond, but it's probably the closest of a match you'll find.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
