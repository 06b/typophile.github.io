  "content": "I need a bit of direction re colour matching and was wondering if anyone here could help me out.   \n   \nI work in the printshop at my architecture school. I get a lot of complaints from students that the colours didn�t turn out as they appeared on the screen- and they are right! Blacks come out green and browns come out pinkish coral! Although I deny any responsibility, I must say, they do have reason to complain. The problem is, I have no idea how to fix this problem.   \n   \nI would really like to learn how to get the computer screens and the printers to produce somewhat the same colours. I don�t need EXACT matches, just close approximations. Do you know where I could begin? We have an IT staff at the school, but they are Techie Guys who claim not to know anything about colour.   \n   \nDoes anyone know whether it is the printers that need to be adjusted, the computers themselves or the monitors? Is it likely that all three need adjustment?   \n   \nWe have an hp5500designjet and an hp 5000designjet. We have PC computers everywhere.   \n   \nI know there is software like Spyder which I�m sure I could get the administration to buy and the techie guys to learn and install, but is that the right way of getting the colour generally right? I know that the plotters we have cost about $15,000 so they must be capable of printing black and browns no?   \n   \nAny general suggestions about how fix our color problem?\n\n",

Also, check out the Epson site, you may need the correct PPD files por whatever is used in the PC world. Most high-end color calibration and workflow for graphics and publishing is done on a Mac so their is a lot more Mac info about. It CAN be done on a PC (so they tell me) but I have no direct successful experience. I worked on a PC for nine monthes developing graphics for web sites. I personally found the PC to be a big pain in the tuchas for graphics but maybe someone here has had a more fortunate experience and can enlighten you.   \n   \nChrisL\n\n"
