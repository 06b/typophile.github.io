  "content": "I'm working on a logo for a brand. It's about home-made deli food (delicatessen)produced in smaller quantities. It's a food with a twist which means it contains interesting mix of ingredients in otherwise ordinary products.\n\nI'm looking for suggestions for typeface that would communicate HOME-MADE, WARM, and in the same time EXCLUSIVE (high quality) .  \nI already have a solution for expressing \"food with a twist\" part so the type doesn't have to express that. Maybe a slight touch of \"a twist\" in type would be OK. I am particulary interested to see SERIF typeface suggestions.\n\nI'm only looking for a professional typeface since we're talking about high quality product.\n\n",

      "content": "Hmmm...thanks for the suggestions.However, I want to keep the type simple with just a touch of \"difference\". Also these fonts like Clarendon and Avance seem to be a little too rough in this case. I imagine the needed type would be a bit more softer (a bit rounder or finer letters than in suggested types). It's a small food production company so I want it more warm.\n\n"
