Looks like the [update for CS2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104020929/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321322029/ref=pd_sim_3/002-2299043-6754462?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance) is due to hit the shelves in December.\n\nFor looking up basic stuff, I use the [Visual Quickstart Series for InDesign CS](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104020929/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321213483/ref=pd_sim_4/002-2299043-6754462?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance). I'm also interested in getting [Adobe InDesign CS/CS2 Breakthroughs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104020929/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321334132/ref=wl_it_dp/002-2299043-6754462?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I3POBABQD2RZOL&v=glance&colid=3HNIFP5RGYVYN) by Blatner.\n\n"
