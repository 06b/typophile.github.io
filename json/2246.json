      "content": "Ole: I like! The letterforms are very illustrative. The \"A\" reminds me of a sumo wrestler and the \"M\" looks like a Japanese arch. The i is a little dull compared to the other letters. And the bottom stroke of the G seems a little flat and the connection is awkward. How would it look if the G had a vertical bar sort of like the horizontal double bars of the H and K? Also, did you intend for some strokes to be slightly thinner than others? Perhaps it is just the screen.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023082647im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21463.gif)\n\n"
