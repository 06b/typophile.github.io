The original foundry is unable to take on the extra work, but is open to allowing another party to build it out.\n\nWhere would I go to get something like this done?\n\nDoes anyone have advice or experience with this kind of situation?\n\nThanks in advance...\n\n [‹ Helvetica neutral?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080904221314/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38975 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [50 percent off: Sale at Stone Type Foundry ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080904221314/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38645 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’m also looking for someone with a good knowledge of international font support issues that can guide me through the intricacies of supporting fonts in other languages.  \n—  \nCheers, Clint\n\n"
