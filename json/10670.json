One of my favorite examples of just how tight can you space a line and still make out the individual words. Probably worth $40 just for that.   \n   \nBut the first edition would actually be worth quite a bit. If you have the Dover paperback, yeah, you paid a bit too much maybe. Check Abe.com to compare prices on this.\n\n"
