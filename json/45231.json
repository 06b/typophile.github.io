Designing a typeface based on a specific area. I have chosen the area, it is a landmark that deals with two cultures and the reclaiming of land.\n\nI’m thinking of pulling the semiotics out of the area and visually working these into letter forms giving a more meaningful typeface and a deeper visual/verbal representation on the specific area.\n\nSound like an interesting project? Perhaps not?\n\nWhat other area’s of design would you recommend considering when using type?\n\nEDIT:\n\nE.g.\n\n- typeface design  \n- 3D type  \n- interactive type\n\n [‹ typesetting a book need some suggestions](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709013610/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46726 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [sans serif logo--what company? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709013610/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46772 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

A sign is a representation of something, not the thing. And because of this, a sign is always the construction of meaning (when interpreted).  \nThe reason why the Pigiarniq’s Typographer opt for that shape of letters sure has some kind of meaning and this meaning sure is related to this region of Nunavut.\n\nOther areas of study, I suggest:  \n [The Elements of Typographic Style](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709013610/http:/www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1214482389&sr=1-1), Robert Bringhurst (obvious)  \nInformation Design (Edward Tufle’s books)  \nVisual Perception (Rudolf Arnheim’s books)  \nand perhaps it will help to take a look into Graphic Design history to see how typography has being used over the centuries in order to convey meaning. (perhaps [Meggs History of Graphic Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709013610/http:/www.amazon.com/Meggs-History-Graphic-Design-Philip/dp/0471699020)?)\n\nHope this information helps...\n\nBest Luck for the project!\n\n"
