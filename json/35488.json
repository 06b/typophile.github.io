I realize that there’s some new stuff coming out of Linotype and some of the other foundries Monotype has purchased, but it’s not the great stuff coming out of the indie foundries, and the promotion of these new typefaces is not nearly as good as Veer or Fontshop. While having thousands of old fonts to milk is by no means a bad business model, it is not one that can grow enough to justify investing in the company.\n\n"

Reports suggest it includes twelve type families - 11 of which are all old-fonts from the Monotype, ITC, Linotype or Microsoft libraries (the twelfth is Marker Felt - don’t know who did that one).

My point was that the bright stars of type design that I see from this organization are Lester and Crossgrove and, given its size, I wish there were more.\n\nAnd when I say Monotype Imaging Holdings doesn’t give a hoot about type design, I am referring to an ownership that wants to make money, but doesn’t care much about its legacy. I am referring mostly to ITC, a collection that is — as anyone who has followed it in the last 7 years would agree — a sad shadow of its former self. Nothing remarkable has come from the library since Monotype acquired them in 2000. Click “New Fonts” at itcfonts.com and see a page filled with very few actually new designs (Swank? Baylac?). The only genuinely new typefaces I can find in 06-07 are [ITC Outpost](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2006/Feb2006.htm), [ITC Aram](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2006/March2006.htm), [ITC Kloegirl](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2006/Kloegirl.htm), [ITC Anima](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2006/Anima.htm), [ITC Jante Antiqua](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2007/0407_JanteAntiqua.htm), and [ITC Vellvé](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2007/0507_Vellve.htm). Only two of those are interesting.\n\nThe day _[U&lc](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/U%252526lc)_ [died](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22669.html) I started to worry about ITC. The day Monotype bought ITC, I said a sad goodbye.\n\nLinotype, on the other hand, has clearly been producing great work with Kobayashi/Frutiger/Zapf. And both Mono and Lino are valiantly OpenTypifying their libraries, which consumes a lot of resources and isn’t recognized by the general public, but is a worthwhile effort.\n\nThere are great people at Monotype who are passionate about type and they do fine work: Lester, Crossgrove, [Allan Haley](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Allan%252BHaley), [Delve Withrington](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031849/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Delve%252BWithrington) and their custom type team.\n\nI just wish the ownership recognized what they acquired in ITC and gave it a new life rather than letting it sputter and die. They certainly have the money to do great things.

Think of the good will from the design community that single act would generate.\n\n"

Those are the things investors look for when determining the financial health of a company, cashflow, cash on hand, revenue streams, etc . . . I would guess retail revenue accounts for 40% of the total revenue of Monotype.\n\nWhile I’m not any closer to knowing what really goes on behind closed doors than the rest of you, I do know so far the only commentary about this has been from a font designers perspective and not an investors perspective. Follow the money trail backwards and it’ll become quite clear retail releases really don’t affect the bottom line at this level.\n\nMy 2¢  \nStuart :D\n\n"

Corporations license fonts with great forethought, usually by consulting or staff designers. If those designers are not being actively targeted by Monotype marketing they end up recommending fonts from other vendors. I have no doubt that the intense promotional activities of foundries like House Industries, Veer, and Fontshop have a tremendous influence on corporate font licensing. This is why I don’t see Monotype’s business model as well-focused on growth, at least not enough to justify sinking money into it.\n\nThis will be especially important eight years from now when the elder designers and corporate executives of the baby boom are retiring in great numbers. Designers used to those classic Linotype faces will be heading off to the beaches, executives who expect to see those fonts and dislike newer stuff will do the same, and suddenly a portfolio of great twentieth-century typefaces won’t be a great investment.\n\n"

So I’m not worried that the well of font designs will ever run dry for them . . . This holds true for the fonts being added to the Linotype Font Explorer store as well . . .\n\nAlso, it should be noted that most often corporate buyers will go first to existing vendors before digging in to find the original designer of a typeface so even if its a font Monotype doesn’t offer, they may be approached first being they are the approved vendor for font purchases.\n\nNo slight to the thoughts being shared by the group or your commentary Steve, my comment was focused on how Monotype makes money which is different than how we as designers and consumers perceive their income streams.\n\nIt is eye opening to say the least!\n\nStuart :D\n\n"

This applies to type foundries, software developers, everybody. You can’t expect innovation and creativity from large companies except as a coincidental byproduct when they’re going through one of their “oh, we’ve got to make a better product” phases. Such phases occur only when the big cheeses determine that, for a while, a better product will increase profit. Then follows the “resting on our laurels” phase.\n\n"
