  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nCan you identify the attached font? It was used as the title in the main menu of the first network enabled, multiplayer 3D cyber space video game entitled “SPECTRE”. This game was developed by Peninsula Gameworks for the Macintosh in 1990 and published by Velocity in 1991.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018031552im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SPECTRE%20logo%20(from%20original%20game%20main%20menu)_5104.png)\n\nWe are developing an updated version for the iPhone and cannot locate the original font resources in our archives. None of us remember the font name (it's been 20 years!).\n\nAlso, it is not necessary that we find a version with the chrome type of fill, as solid black would suffice.\n\nThank you for your time and interest.  \nBest regards,  \nCraig Fryar, President  \nPeninsula Gameworks\n\n",
