I realize their is some level of subjectivity, but would you consider it to be too flashy for a resume?\n\nThanks for any help. I have to make a decision soon and just don’t want to design around it if it’s a bad idea from the start!\n\n",

I think Peignot is too decorative, and can deliver flavor and punch but I think its best used in advertising.. for a resume, I'd say go with a strong serif font for your headlines- goudy or baskerville- rather than Peignot, which is an art-deco font, and if used clumsily can easily look cheesy.\n\n"
