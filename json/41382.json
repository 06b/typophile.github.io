So I want to have some innovative elements, to add more personality.  \nTake a look at the attached image. Is the Didot Elder by Optimo. I was tempted to use this one, just because the small \"g\" and some caps are very interesting, but some serifs are a litte \"diabolic\" (look at the \"s\" and \"z\").  \nMaybe can you suggest me another serif typeface with cool personality?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100612222742im_/http:/typophile.com/files/didotelder_5003.gif)\n\n",
