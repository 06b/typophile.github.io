  "content": "Hi,   \n   \nI have several typefaces that include special characters like L slash, Eth, Dyet, etc. But in my software (Quark 4.11, Freehand, 8, Photoshop 5.5) they are not available.   \nWhat's wrong? Do I need other keyboard settings, do I have to upgrade something (I'm still running under OS9.2.1)?   \nI would like to fix this, because typefaces with the Adobe Standard Coding don't show all the characters in my software.   \n   \nDoes anyone have some tips or suggestions?   \n   \nThanx,   \nRen�\n\n",

IIRC, the   \n\"MacEncoding\" doesn't support the characters   \nyou're mentioning (eth, lslash, etc).\n\n"

      "content": "Basically, you need to use software that speaks Unicode. In some cases, this only helps if the OS also speaks Unicode fluently (e.g. OS X).   \n   \nYou cannot access these characters in any version of QuarkXPress up to and including 6. Juergen Kurz recently said that they would add Unicode to QXP 7 (at a cost of 18 engineers for 9 months).   \n   \nMore recent versions of Freehand reportedly do Unicode (may require OS X). Photoshop certainly does. Any version of InDesign does. Depending on the application you may need to change keyboard settings to enter these characters, or use the OS X character palette. In Illustrator CS and InDesign, you can use the built-in glyph palette.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

All the characters with accents work, but the eth, thorn, scaron, lslash, onequarter, mu, and more of these characters are not accessable for me.   \nWhy, when they are in, can't I access them? I've looked in my keyboard setting, but I don't have an Iselandic or a Polish one. That might help by accessing the characters, I think.   \n   \nMacOSX and InDesign are coming up.
