  "content": "I'm fairily new to this site and have made a couple requests--one of them got a response that said \"again...\" meaning of course it's a very common request. And I've seen this a lot while clicking through other threads, i.e., \"DIN, again...Eclat, again...\"   \n   \nObviously the board has a search feature, but I was wondering if there's a list somewhere with the \"most common\" requests. Perhaps something for the FAQ, etc.? Additionally, I'd simply be curious to know what things get requested the most also.   \n   \nWhat a great board though.\n\n",

With the fonts, it is simply that they are popular or trendy. Or sometimes it's just a weird cluster. With the logos, it's people who don't bother to do a search before posting a request. Also the search feature isn't that good.   \n   \nIt's been suggested before to make a greatest hits list for people to check before they post a thread but who has the time???   \n   \nAlso, people who aren't in the design business don't necessarily know that a lot of corporate logos, magazine fonts, etc are custom or proprietary and therefore not available to us peons.\n\n"

This sample of Myriad was 30 points. I would suggest 550-600 pixel width as a sample size.
