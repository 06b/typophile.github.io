I'd like to know the font for numerals: '20', '50' (Trade Gothic?) and the font used for 'Twenty dollars', 'Fifty dollars'. I know they're easy, but I can't figure them out.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130413235218im_/http:/typophile.com/files/20_obverse_final_3622.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130413235218im_/http:/typophile.com/files/50_obverse_final_4684.jpg)\n\nSecond one by [Michelle Haft](http://web.archive.org/web/20130413235218/http:/richardsmith.posterous.com/dollar-redeign-michelle-haft).
