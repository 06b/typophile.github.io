      "content": "Listen think about this: Professional Teams make a ton of money on marketing their logos on merchandise. A good example is The New York Giants brought back a retro jersey that was red (last worn in 1952), why to sell retro jerseys for the Holiday Season. The New York Giants are known as big blue. So if you are going to have a propriority look it pays to make everything custom. This also allows your team of lawyers to sue anyone who uses the logo or mark without paying big fees. Its all about money.\n\n"
