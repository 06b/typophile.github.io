  "content": "Hi everyone. I'm new here, and I chose this forum as a last resort, to identify a font. Even though I can grasp some graphic work, I'm a programmer, not designer, so please bear with me.\n\nIn short, I have to build a site, using fonts that are present on a flyer from the company. Of course, no one could provide any information, just an image (jpg) of 72dpi. I've tried a few offline/online tools to identify it, Google-d around quite some time, but the result wasn't the desired one. So I've edited the image, and cropped the only word which has that font. Here it is:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184700im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font2_5632.jpg)\n\nThe closest guess of mine would be those:\n\n[http://www.linotype.com/610732/NeueFrutigerProBlack-product.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184700/http:/www.linotype.com/610732/NeueFrutigerProBlack-product.html \"http://www.linotype.com/610732/NeueFrutigerProBlack-product.html\")\n\n[http://www.linotype.com/517462/DINNextPaneuropeanBold-ot-cff-w1g-font.ht...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184700/http:/www.linotype.com/517462/DINNextPaneuropeanBold-ot-cff-w1g-font.html?showVariation=727058 \"http://www.linotype.com/517462/DINNextPaneuropeanBold-ot-cff-w1g-font.html?showVariation=727058\")\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/neue\\_frutiger\\_pro\\_black/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184700/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/neue_frutiger_pro_black/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/neue\\_frutiger\\_pro\\_black/\")\n\nbut obviously they are not the right ones.\n\nWell, my question is simple. Could someone kindly decipher it, and name it, or, even better, could someone suggest me the closest alternative? I don't know yet if the client would pay for a font, but I'm almost sure not. Thanks in advance.\n\nKind regards,  \nAndrew\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Gotham Black \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [kthomps5](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184700/http:/typophile.com/user/175823 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
