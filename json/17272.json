Great newsy font but generates labyrinth effect in Polish when set in 39 mm columns. Already tried a variety of H&Js. This one seems optimal but not satisfying - the gaps.. 39 mm column is a must. Any ideas?\n\nBTW: Does anybody know any newspaper in compact format [apart from Independent on Sunday] which uses 6 column grid?  \nThanx in advance.\n\nknap\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [freight39mm.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119134631/http:/typophile.com/files/freight39mm.jpg) | 225.34 KB |\n\n [‹ Swiss typographer Marcel Nebel](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119134631/http:/typophile.com/node/17719 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [the Apple question ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119134631/http:/typophile.com/node/17706 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
