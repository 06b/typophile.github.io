      "content": "Regardless of anyone's critique or feelings about AGG with or without alternates and ligatures, I bet Herb Lubalin and Aaron Burns (and maybe Ralph Ginsberg) would be laughing their venerable arses off about the continuing releases, re-releases and re-marketing of what NEVER began a \"typeface\" to start with.\n\n**Herb Lubalin:**\n\n_'The dedication page of the first issue of Avant Garde magazine reads: 'As most of the world's ills are traceable to old imperatives, old superstitions and old fools, this magazine is exhuberantly dedicated to the future.'_\n\n'For one who finds the present almost impossible to contemplate, the future is absolutely beyond my realm of understanding. So when Ralph Ginsberg asked me, in early 1967, to project myself into the future and design an avant garde logotype for Avant Garde magazine, I felt entirely inadequate to the task.\n\n'I had three alternatives: (1) reject the job, which would automatically admit defeat; (2) reveal myself as a failure, which wittingly I would never do; and (3) make a satire of the name (which I felt was the only avant garde way to interpret what avant garde means — and what avant garde means is meaningless, since once it is seen, it is no longer avant garde. ) I chose alternative no.3)\n\n'I submitted the logotype in Old English, Bank Script, Cartoon Bold, Dom Casual, Flash italic, Wedding Text, Monastic, Buffalo Bill, and a last-ditch effort reflective of Coca-Cola.\n\n'Ginsberg said, 'Stop kidding around!.'\n\n'I then tried to dazzle him with a multitude of ornate swashes which usually does the trick. He said 'Cut it out!'\n\n'It was clear that I had to produce a piece of typography unlike anything done before. The juxtaposition of the letters AVA with their related slants was evident in several of my sixty abortive attempts, and it became critical in the cockeyed lettering of my final sketch. As soon as I worked out a pencil rough, I knew I had hit on the ultimate solution. I can't really remember doing it. I only remember it being there on my layout pad.\n\n'When I looked at the lettering there was a feeling that I only remember having once before in my graphic lifetime, and that was when I designed the 'Mother and Child' logotype. I knew the Avant Garde logotype would stand the test of time and remain avant garde for a long time. It was a subconscious or intuitive feeling that you get only occasionally — a feeling that you have created some thing that cannot be made better — by anyone.'\n\nThe logo was the basis of the typeface design we know today as 'Avant Garde'.\n\nNow, obviously, Herb \"prettied-up\" his tale about how \"Avant Garde Gothic\" came into existence for marketing purposes. Basically he would have said, \"_Jeez, Ralph... quit your f\\*?king whinning and use the goddam mother-f#@king logo and stop being such a big a@#hole!_\"\n\nMeanwhile, time passes, and Aaron is scratching his forehead thinking \"_How are we_ [ITC] _going to make money with all these half-drawn designs from PLINC?_\" or something like that.\n\n\"_I know, let's get all of our friends and design buddies MAKE them popular by using them in high-visibility ad campaigns! Hmmm, and the logo that Herb did for Ralph, some folks have been asking what font they used... well, let's quickly make it a typeface so we can license it to Linotype, Monotype and Compugraphic! I'm sure they might stay popular for a couple of years while we start building new designs._\"\n\nTruth is always better than academic posturing. =o\n\n"
