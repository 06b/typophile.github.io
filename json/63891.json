Slatterine is a ‘Streamline-era’ family drawing its inspiration from the ‘futuristic’ designs of the 1950s. Stannard is a pure piece of advertising inspired Nostalgia from the 1920s. Starting from November 5 both families will be offered at a 30% discount on myfonts.com.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202214818im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Slatterine_Sale_Poster%20copy_3830.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202214818im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Stannard_Sale_Poster_3662.jpg)\n\n",
