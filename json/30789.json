They just don’t hold a candle to beautifully styled fonts.\n\nIn all my years of helping ID fonts - when it comes to pixel fonts I offer two suggestions. And hope your eyes are young enough to go through to find what you are looking for.\n\nCommercial Pixel Fonts  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=pixel](http://web.archive.org/web/20090807111144/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=pixel \"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=pixel\")\n\nShareware/Freeware/Charityware/Beerware  \n [http://www.dafont.com/bitmap.php?page=1&nb\\_ppp\\_old=10&text=Type+your+tex...](http://web.archive.org/web/20090807111144/http:/www.dafont.com/bitmap.php?page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=Type+your+text+here&nb_ppp=50&af=on&classt=pop \"http://www.dafont.com/bitmap.php?page=1&nb\\_ppp\\_old=10&text=Type+your+text+here&nb\\_ppp=50&af=on&classt=pop\")\n\nSorry I cannot be more helpful than that - but hopefully your font is among the many growing pixel fonts that are out there...\n\n"
