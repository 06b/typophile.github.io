  "content": "Hi again:\n\nHere are there three images of fonts that I’m curious about but don’t know what they are.\n\nThe first is for TASCHEN. I’m looking the numbers ‘25’ in this.  \nBTW… The other TASCHEN fonts are set in Scala Sans, HF&J Didot, and Inserat.\n\nSecond is the numerals for a book by erberto carboni. Text is set in Bauer Bodoni but again its those funky numbers I’m looking for!!!\n\nLast is the Phaidon book “fashion today”. I thought something by HF&J- but nope.\n\nThanks for all the helps,\n\nMikey :-)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/taschen_25er_flyer_2006_5076.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/25_5311.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/fashion2_6720.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/fashion3_5606.gif)\n\n",
