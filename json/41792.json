      "content": "You _could_ use it to print on shirts. There is generally a difference between textile and paper water-based screenprinting ink, but nothing so substantial that you couldn’t do it just to recover the ink. As far as water-based goes, it lacks the opacity of Plastisol inks—which are acrylic-based—and cures itself. So you’ve got to move a little faster with it. It’ll work though, its worth a shot. But yes, there are water-based screen-printing inks that textile printers use all the time. A lot nicer to breathe.\n\nI will say that i’ve had problems crossing plastisol emulsion with water-based inks and vice versa.\n\n"

      "content": "Am I right to assume that by water-based inks, you mean waterborne acrylic emulsion that is waterproof when dry, right? Not a soluble gum based paint like gouache or poster tempera?\n\nIf that is the case it should be compatible with most brands of artists acrylic paints and inks. You may need to add an elastic medium to prevent it from cracking on garments. Ceramcoat Textile Medium is good if you are producing a relatively small volume. It’s available at craft stores. For larger volumes I’m sure a commercial silkscreen supply house can provide an equivalent. Of course adding clear acrylic medium of any kind will increase transparency of the inks, so this is generally only a viable solution on white shirts.\n\n"
