I wouldn't think there exists a font today  \nto match, but is there any similar font that I might  \nuse for the restaurant's website?\n\nI note the serifs on the lowercase l, v, a, and d,  \nand the top serif on the uppercase C.\n\n[http://clevelanderbar.googlepages.com/Clevelander1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417045128/http:/clevelanderbar.googlepages.com/Clevelander1.jpg \"http://clevelanderbar.googlepages.com/Clevelander1.jpg\")\n\nThanks.\n\nredstart\n\n",
