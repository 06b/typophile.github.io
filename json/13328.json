The problem is that this developer never left any files or information regarding the fonts that he used when he initially developed the website.\n\nAnyone care to lend me a hand and try to identify the font that was used in [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110035220/http:/www.bearslax.com/images/system/cla_logo_large.gif) logo?\n\nThanks in advance - I really appreciate your help…\n\n- Al Liebowitz\n\n",

Also looked at parts of DaFont’s Techno styles. I suggested Typophile to Al, because I was getting nowhere, and thought someone here might recognize the font(s) used. I think the angled A might be a customization to make this more logo-ish, since it’s an easy three straight lines to make.)_\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
