So I took on Cyrillic, knowing next to nothing about Cyrillic, but figuring that with such limited choices, there couldn't be too much to do wrong. Can someone more familiar with these languages tell me how it turned out? In particular I wonder if my unusual rendering of capital Ф is valid and if Э and З are sufficiently disambiguated.
