They appear to contain an XML header in some propriety format, followed by encoded data of the actual images.\n\nNot something you could program off-hand (although the $499 seems a bit steep).\n\nI seem to be missing the actual how-to-use as a font, though -- does a Mac recognize these files as a valid font type?\n\n"

Plugins for Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress are currently close to be released, as is Photofont WebReady, an application that allows web designers to produce dynamic web page headlines using photofonts (using a mechanism similar to sIFR).\n\nAdam\n\n"
