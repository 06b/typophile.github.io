John, you're encouraged to re-post your   \nthoughts on PDFs to the PDF thread.]   \n   \nI'd have to agree, Mark. I also suspect that most pirated fonts are first stolen from their original licensees--an intern at a design firm walking off with a CDR full of fonts that the company paid $$$ to license.   \n  \nThere's one thing even better than PDF, though: printed specimens. Most of the more established font vendors will send you printed specimens if you ask for them.   \n  \n...   \n  \nHrant, I do not understand how changing my icon to reflect my own political position is any more \"underhanded\" than the rest of yooz putting peace signs on yours, a trend which I believe was started at the suggestion of one of the moderators. Not keen on conflating \"peace\" with complacency, I was inclined to disagree. You seem to be the only person who has a problem with it.   \n  \nPlease, if you want to get into this, start a thread dedicated to the War in General Discussions. No one is stopping you from doing that. As they say, \"anything goes.\" It would be nice, though, if we could keep this discussion about PDF and not something else.\n\n"

      "content": "_The peace signs are a political statement, yes. But as such they are pretty neutral._   \n   \nI sure as heck hope they're not neutral. Peace isn't a likely outcome of wishful thinking.   \n   \nI'm opposed to the war for specific moral reasons that I suspect differ from those of a lot of other contributors to this thread. For me, whether the Iraqi people are better or worse off after the war than before is not sufficient reason to either support or oppose the war. Likewise, the justifications put forward by Bush and Blair are largely beside the point. Similarly, Jacques Chirac may be rightly concerned about US hegemony in the Middle East, but that wouldn't in itself be grounds to oppose the war. Quite simply, this war completely fails to conform to the criteria for a _just war_ that have been laid down, debated and asserted for some 1,600 years, and which I believe provide the only sound moral guidance to the questions of when a war is just and how a just war should be fought. It is on these grounds that the Pope has spoken out against the war, and I believe his reasoning, and that of his theologians, is sound. I've read the lectures and essays by some US Catholics who attempt to jerry-rig just war philosophy to fit the circumstances, but I am unconvinced by their contortions. Ironically, as a fellow Catholic, John Butler may have a better appreciation of my opposition to the war than some people 'on my side'.\n\n"

The illusion that a state can be run morally and that there is any such thing as international law has been knocked on the head. The US government is in such a powerful position that it can do what it wants.   \n  \nDespite the moral register used by Whitehouse spokesmen, the US government has chosen an amoral path. Its actions are based on ethical decisions about the pros and cons of whatever it happens to be doing at the time. Opposing the invasion and occupation of Iraq (this isn't a war) with moral arguments is a waste of energy.   \n  \nAnd I think the Vatican is fully aware of this.   \n  \nMatha\n\n"

      "content": "_Opposing the invasion and occupation of Iraq (this isn't a war) with moral arguments is a waste of energy._   \n   \nI disagree, because I see the moral argument as the only sound one. The fact is, from purely political arguments I could go either way on the Iraq war: hypocrisy and uncertainty of motive and evidence exist on both sides. To try to maintain a consistent position on purely political grounds is futile, because there is the _possibility_ that the other side is more correct or less incorrect. The just war tradition provides an ethical framework for looking at any conflict from a non-political perspective, which is its enduring strength. Even if it were now discovered that Saddam Hussein was hiding a nuclear weapons program in the desert and proof positive was found of his intention to sell or give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations, the US invasion of Iraq still failed to meet the criteria of a just war (_ad bello_ at least; I'm not sure that we have enough information to judge US conduct _in bello_). The fact that no such evidence is forthcoming is certainly convenient for those opposed to the war. but the moral argument stands whether such evidence is found or not, because such evidence was not in US possession when they launched the war.   \n   \nThe US has not chosen an 'amoral path': the just war tradition and Catholic morality do not provide for amorality. Shooting without being able to clearly see what the target is is not amoral, it is immoral. Exercising our ability to say that it is immoral, and to explain why it is immoral, is never a waste of energy.\n\n"

Succinctly, one could say that the just war tradition is necessary for Christians, but Christianity is not necessary to the just war tradition. The idea of a just war, the _ad bello_ conditions for such a war and the _in bello_ conduct during such a war, can be defined independently of specifically Catholic or Christian ethics (although orthodox Christians would point out that this is because natural law is part of a divinely created order). The idea that a defensive war is just while an aggresive war is not does not require a belief in a deity, a saviour, the resurrection, the real presence of the eucharist, or any other Catholic doctrine. On the other hand, I do believe that ethics divorced from religion have a tendency to become very shaky and may slip into the kind of relativism you describe.\n\n"

The orthodox Catholic teaching has always been that ethics derive from natural law, which is the objective character of created reality knowable by the human intellect.
