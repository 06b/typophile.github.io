It's a bit of fun, but is all a bit rude from the 'female' front cover - (not quite a Brazilian, ;^), to the male back cover, so if you're a bit prudish or easily shocked don't open the pdf.\n\nI'm very proud that Roberto chose Houschka Pro as the text face using style set 2, and I must admit it looks pretty damn sexy!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TDC\\_brochure\\_final\\_1\\_28.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123154202/http:/typophile.com/files/TDC_brochure_final_1_28_0.pdf) | 157.14 KB |\n\n",

Not only in terms of the male/female dynamics (which does make it feel like this can't be targeted at me – I know there are many more type guys than type girls, but maybe this isn't the best way to change that), to me it also feels too «young», more cheap than witty, and too much like an iPod ad.

I do wonder if the board was thinking about them when it approved this design.\n\n"

This is heavy-handedly overt in a way we already see more than enough of every day, and that I think fails to connect to the kind of sexiness and magic that working in-depth with type has. Yes, of course there are voluptuous curves in type. But it's deeper than that.  \nThere's so much culture, so much depth in type; precision and sophistication and sensitivity. So much in type is about perception and about insinuation; so much of it is about the _un_spoken, the _in_visible. THAT to me is where type and eroticism connect.\\* And sorry, but this brochure has the precision, sophistication, sensitivity, and, yes, sexiness of a sledge hammer.  \nIt's not about being prude; it's about missing the magic. That of type and that of sex. Maybe that's just me, and maybe I am really just not the target audience.\n\n(\\* I'm wondering if that might be a male/female rift right there?)\n\n"
