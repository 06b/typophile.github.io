Have a class consisting of all the glyphs in the font, and have it appear when nothing in the class proceeds the two glyphs in question.\n\nNote that this could then get triggered by anything else that breaks the context, such as a change of font. Even a change within the same family (bold or italic, for instance) would do it....\n\nT\n\n"

This ligature is ment to replace a specific word not the same characters within another word. This word wouldn't be a word inside the text without a preceding space. But it still would be a word at the begining of the line.  \nb\n\n"
