  "content": "Hi all!  \nI'm thinking in develop a new typeface.  \nAfter some reasearch and studies I found in an old Portuguese Pharmacie lettering (60/70's). Quiet nice and decided to do a \"similar\" typeface with some personal adjustments and \"feelings\".  \nBut since the ideia from an lettering I dont want to waste my time in develop something that already exist (and there is a lot of typefaces outhere).  \nOnce again I added something personal but I want to know (from your expertise) if there is something like the letters that I designed.  \nIts just a first studie. Any ideias/critics welcome.\n\nAntónio\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419061852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/amarantino2_5634.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Thats for the comments!  \nYes, its similar in style to Hubert Jocham’s Milk...didn't know thst typeface  \nBut like \"both\" of you said \"don’t let that prevent you from pursuing something similar\" and in fact I already had designed some letters that are quiet diferent. That a look and give me your feedback.\n\nAnother interesting point I could ask now is: I'm design the letter in my favorite drawing tool (freehand). Already made some search about the best way (price/quality) in software to produce fonts. Is FontForge a good soft? I dont want to spend money in a software, like FontLab Studio or Fontographer that I will use a couple of times...\n\nThanks for the input.\n\nAntónio\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419061852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font1_5568.jpg)\n\n"
