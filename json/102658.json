  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am designing an essay book: 11 x 17 cm. I would like to give it an avant-garde look, a kind of mix between russian constructivism and the german avant garde in Germany in the 30's. El Lissitzky, John Heartfield, Bauhaus… The best example of what I am looking for is Cristiana Couceiro, two images attached.\n\n[http://typophile.com/files/Cristiana-Couceiro-33.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720043326/http:/typophile.com/files/Cristiana-Couceiro-33.jpg)  \n [http://typophile.com/files/tumblr\\_lquhtcp2I71qa5y9j.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720043326/http:/typophile.com/files/tumblr_lquhtcp2I71qa5y9j.jpg)\n\nSo, I am looking for a couple of fonts working well together. I was thinking why essay books usually use serif fonts for body text, and sans —in case of using a sans— only for titles and page numbers. Is there a rule or is ok to use a serif for titles and sans for body text? In both cases, which fonts could give this look?\n\nRegards\n\nT.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Cristiana-Couceiro-33.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720043326/http:/typophile.com/files/Cristiana-Couceiro-33.jpg) | 273.92 KB |\n| [tumblr\\_lquhtcp2I71qa5y9j.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720043326/http:/typophile.com/files/tumblr_lquhtcp2I71qa5y9j.jpg) | 216.7 KB |\n\n",
