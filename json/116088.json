  "content": "I have drawn some illustrations for a novel. I already have scanned them but I actually cannot find the right way to “clean” them in order to print them as a part of the book. I do not want to create a vector of them using AI because I will lost the “handmade” part of it. So I tried to use brush tool to clean them but I am not sure if this will work quite alright for what is needed. The style of the drawings have something of the engraving art. If someone can help me solve this out I will be glad.\n\n",

Convert Photo to Grayscale.  \n2. Run Artistic/Poster Edges Filter at 1 for Thickness,  \n6 for Intensity and 2 for Posterization.  \n3. Use Image Adjust Threshold to fine tune your  \nSketch.  \n4. Convert to Bitmap using Diffusion Dither.\n\n"
