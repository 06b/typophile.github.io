  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm working on the Front End for a modern arcade game. Something similar to SEGA's 'Afterburner Climax', and i'm looking for heading and body fonts.\n\nI like the italic, smooth feel of Ray Larabie's [Stasmic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012184330/http:/www.dafont.com/stasmic.font) but i'm worried it may be a little too light and difficult to read, even as a heading font.\n\nAnyone fancy suggesting some suitable heading/title and body fonts?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDan.\n\n",

On the other hand, I'm not looking for something too futuristic either.\n\n[http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/687/headerbodycomparison.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012184330/http:/img29.imageshack.us/img29/687/headerbodycomparison.gif \"http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/687/headerbodycomparison.gif\") (Excuse the link, I can't work out the correct tags \\>.\\<)\n\nBody text? I'm thinking perhaps Century Gothic Italic, though i'm far from convinced.\n\n"
