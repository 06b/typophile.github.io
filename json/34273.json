  "content": "Hi —\n\nI'm wondering if anyone knows of a nicely designed '@' symbol that would look good used with Futura Extra Bold. I've tried all the cuts of Futura I have and a load of other fonts but can't find anything decent. The closest I've come to something near to acceptable is the '@' in LT Kabel Black, but that's not great. Anybody have any suggestions?\n\n(PS. I've had a go at designing my own, but I'm no type designer and the end results looked crude as hell...)\n\nThanks\n\n",
