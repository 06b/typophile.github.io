In contrast, I once had to ask Apple a question about QTVR (which I had recently purchased), and they wanted to charge me $50 to ask it, with no guarantees that it would be adequately answered.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Thank you in advance and I'm looking forward to being in these forums!   \n   \nFYI, you can buy a manual for $39.95 at the FontLab site -- look for the manual link -- it's printed and sent to you directly from a third party.\n\n"

      "content": "There are two ways to import Illustrator outlines into FontLab.   \n   \n1. You can copy and paste an outline directly from Illustrator into FontLab. Note that some bugs have been reported with this method, and I believe Yuri is working to resolve these. At the moment, it is best to copy and past individual outlines, not groups of outlines. Very complex outlines may also have problems.   \n   \n2. You can save Illustrator outlines as EPS and import using the Glyph/'Import from EPS...' function. I should note that I have not used Illustrator for a long time (I do all my drawing directly in FontLab), so I can't confirm that this method is without problems.   \n   \nI recommend that you join the [FontLab user community](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421053006/http:/groups.msn.com/FontLab) on MSN. This is a very lively forum with lots of knowledgeable contributors.\n\n"

      "content": "I think I can help, since I always relied on Illustrator to transfer vector art in FontStudio and now I started doing so in FontLab.   \n   \nIllustrator support the copy and paste function John mentioned, but the architecture of Illustrator 10 is different. You should use Illustrator 8 or 9.   \n   \nIf you have FreeHand 10, you can easily use the \"copy special\" feature which allows a different copy strategy for different formats. Selecting the EPS format works exactly like if you are copying directly from Illustrator 8 or 9.   \n   \nI tested FontLab with a lot of RAM and very complex digitized forms of a hyper-decorated Art Nouveau alphabet juping back and forth between Illustrator 10 and Freehand 10 and FontLab and everything vorks fine. I'm under MacOs 9.1, by the way.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> [Oh, I really know nothing of FontLab (I did not own previous version 3 and I just bought the new 4.5) compared to people like John Hudson or the fantastic John Butler, the OpenType maestro. Just out of curiosity: have you been able to copy directly from Illustrator 10 to FontLab cells or have you done it via FreeHand 10? I'm under Os9, maybe you're under Jaguar (OsX 10.2x)? Also, I've seen your ITC text face release, don't recall, the name. It seems very, very interesting but hard to judge from the small samples. Would it be possible to have a pdf? Besides, here in Italy many people used Monolein for Book covers, some in a very bad way. Monolein and SGI seem separated at birth, but SGI was more gracious, in my opinion.]\n\n"
