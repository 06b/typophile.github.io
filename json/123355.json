But bonus points to anyone who knows what they are!\n\nPPS - Just edited to change title from \"sans serif\" to \"serif.\" It IS a serif font I'm looking for!\n\nPPPS - Found the font (it's [Tiepolo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415062451/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiepolo/))! And the script font is [Hemmet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415062451/http:/www.dafont.com/hemmet.font)! Unfortunately I can't find the sans serif! More explanation in the comments.\n\n",

So there you go!\n\nThanks also to Ryuk for finding that script font!\n\nUnfortunately, the font I assumed would be the easiest to find turned out to be the hardest. I knew it was a humanist sans serif, but unfortunately most of the usual suspects - Myriad Pro, Frutiger, Open Sans, Source Sans - lack that slab serif on the capital I's, and the ones I'm aware of that do - Tahoma, Verdana - just kinda...don't look right.\n\nAny help?\n\n"
