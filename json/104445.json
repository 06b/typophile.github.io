  "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI need some serious help identifying this font in the photos attached. I'm not 100% sure it is an actual font - or it was at one point and then played with (obvious but the thunder bolt)\n\nMy thought process lead me to to think it was something like: 'Thirsty Script' but it's not block enough. Then i thought it might be a variation on a baseball style. That didn't lead anywhere either. I ended up very close with 'TX NineBolt' but it's still not 100%\n\nAnyone else able to help on this one?\n\nCheers\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [20130419-band-of-horses-15-x595-1366405233.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828203357/http:/typophile.com/files/20130419-band-of-horses-15-x595-1366405233.jpg) | 32.4 KB |\n| [464079935\\_1fd694f2c5\\_z.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828203357/http:/typophile.com/files/464079935_1fd694f2c5_z.jpg) | 52.11 KB |\n\n",
