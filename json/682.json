Although you'll hve to do a little about spacing and kerning. (you could try to base those on leadtype, no kerning?) If you want to claen the forms up, beware of not loosing of loosing the vitality it has now.   \n   \nFor modern use, you might want to have a small 's' (or not!)   \n   \n--Jacques\n\n"

So he dont italiced the caps rigt? maby hav to try with the AdobeAldus...   \nSpacing and Kerning... hmmm view my other typedesign and you will see this is one think that I really have to learn. But i will try also to overtoke it from the original.   \n   \nTo William and jacques: Of course a \"short s\" comes... Are there chances to embed it with a Opentype feature?   \n   \nBTW: I must made many more ligatures for this. But what will happan if make somesthink like this: \"fi\" and \"ie\" What if both ligaturs are after another in one word??   \n   \nOkay thanks for the comments... mabye some more?   \n   \nGreets Jens\n\n"

      "content": "This is a beautiful design, and it has   \nquite a bit of potential.   \n   \nI don't think it needs a companion roman,   \nnecessarily. Aldine italics were meant   \nto function independently. It's only relatively   \nrecently that we have begun to pair them   \nwith roman fonts.   \n   \nI also think that a bold version would go   \nagainst the spirit of the face. This design   \ncould easily stand alone as either a text   \nor a display face.   \n   \nI agree with you that the caps should probably   \ntake either a roman or sloped roman form. I'd   \nencourage you to try an upright roman first   \nfor the caps to see how it works.   \n   \nI also agree that you should design a short \"s\"   \nfor beginning and ending letters of words.   \n   \nAs for ligatures, I say design as many as seem   \nto suggest themselves. You should definitely   \ninclude a full range of \"f\" ligatures (\"fb\", \"ff\",   \n\"ffi\", \"ffj\", \"ffl\", \"fft\", \"fh\", \"fi\", \"fj\", \"fk\", \"fl\", and \"ft\"),   \nas well as \"c\" ligatures (\"ch\", \"ck\", \"ct\", etc.)   \nand \"s\" ligatures with long and short \"s\".   \nYou might also consider a \"Th\" ligature,   \nas well as ligatures for the article adjectives,   \ncommon prepositions and conjunctions   \n(The, \"the\", \"An\", \"an\", \"Le\", \"le\", \"La\", \"la\",   \n\"El\", \"el\", \"From\", \"from\", \"And\", \"and\",   \n\"&c\", \"etc.\", etc. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419030252im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) )   \n   \nI also wouldn't change the \"a\" very much,   \nas it looks nice to my eye, and seems to fit   \nthe spirit of the Aldine italic.   \n   \nBest of luck. This could be a great font.   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
