I am wondering what if any pros/cons you think there are in going to 10.5 in terms of the stability of Fontlab, ADFKO, Tal's software etc. And also for Parallels and interaction with Win XP. Thanks!\n\n",

Consider OSX upgrades more like service packs...they're fairly painless so you might as well go with the newer version if you can.\n\nThe big thing is .5 is Time Machine.\n\nBootcamp vs. Parallels isnt' really a security thing. Both are Windows. ;o)\n\nParallels wins out for me as I can run it at the same time as everything else. Store your work files in OSX, and access them from Windows running in Parallels. That way your disk image isn't as large and you can wipe and restore Windows at anytime without loosing your work files.\n\n"

If you have a huge surplus of RAM and multi-core processors, you'll have no problem running everything at once.

My machine is a MacBook Pro 15\" 2 GHz 2 GB.\n\nI'd say, go for it! 10.5.4 has just been released which fixes some nasty crashes with InDesign CS3. Apple has already announced 10.6 (Snow Leopard), so by the time you're well into the academic year, you might start thinking that 10.4 is somewhat outdated. And you definitely don't want to be doing OS updates during crunch time... ;^)\n\n"

Initially it was a bit wonky, but that's been pretty much sorted out.\n\nMy favorite Leopard features (things I would miss if I had to go back to Tiger) are: Quick Look, Time Machine, the streamlined networking user interface, and Spotlight (which works much much better than the Tiger version).\n\nI thought I would like Spaces, but I haven't found it to be that useful. Cover Flow looks cool, but I tend to avoid using it. Quick Look is better if I want to browse the contents of files.\n\nI disable the 3D dock and the translucent menu bar. Other than that, the window \"chrome\" looks nicer and is more consistent.\n\nIn general, I find Leopard to be at least as stable as Tiger. One of the reasons I upgraded so soon was that I was having a lot of stability issues with the Finder in Tiger on my main machine. Leopard cleared it up. Although it may be that re-installing Tiger would have worked just as well.\n\nOne thing: If you have a pre-Intel Mac, you lose the ability to run Classic apps. (Intel Macs can't run Classic apps, even in Tiger.) My experience with OS X is that most of the stability problems I had (especially anything to do with fonts) were related to Classic, so I don't think this is a bad thing.\n\n"

Also, since it isn't supported, you don't get updates or technical support on it, which you would for 10.5.\n\nI use BootCamp on 10.5 with Vista. Dan Rhatigan from last year has 10.5 (?) with Paralells and XP.\n\nAs for this year's class, most of us have updated to 10.5 since its release last year.

Important exchange.\n\nThe balance is that there's loss of OSIX support even on Motorola machines, patched up search, another step towards less clumsy networking, being held hostage by boot camp and then there is the time machine as only the legitimate selling point. For that the tedious new graphix are a heavy price to pay in terms of performance.\n\nI stick to OS 10.4.9 with WinXP on Parallels, until there's a functional upgrade. No need for bootcamp whatsoever. My present configuration is rock-solid, well integrated and fast on a 2.4Ghz, 4Gb memory MBP.\n\nFor FontLab and Fontographer I use Windows because I happen to have these versions, for CS3 Mac for speed or Windows for convenient Unicode interchange and most international functionality, as the MacOS still hasn't caught up with Windows.\n\nI gave up on the MacOS searching function. If I really want to find what I am looking for, and not everything else that looks vaguely like it but what I am not looking for, then I search with the Windows file browser.\n\nThomas Milo  \nDecoType  \n [www.decotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191403/http:/www.decotype.com/ \"www.decotype.com\")\n\n"

For example, some applications like Freehand or Quark 6.5 have not been updated and are not known to work reliably on 10.5. If you're application software is current-- CS 3, Quark 7.x, now would be a good time to upgrade. Keep in mind that we are currently on the fourth 10.5 update, so many serious issues have already been addressed.\n\nAs Mark pointed out, there are some nice features with 10.5. For example, once I started using Quicklook (space bar) to preview files, I've needed to keep fewer applications open. My problem now, is that I now try to do it on my Windows system, and puzzle for a second about why it isn't working.\n\n"
