[Aviano Didone’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122450/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-didone/) high contrast forms lend elegant beauty, luxury and romance to your designs and it’s extended letterforms provide strength and power. Aviano’s foundational classical forms give the face a look that is unique for Didone faces. Aviano Didone is a bold new interpretation of vertically contrasted type.\n\nAviano Didone comes in five different weights and is packed with OpenType features. Want ball terminals for that logotype or headline? Flat serifs? Swash forms? Aviano Didone includes 102 alternate characters. Five style sets are available, and Art Deco inspired alternates, small forms, swash, titling and stylistic alternates. Aviano Didone also includes 40 discretionary ligatures for artistic typographic compositions. Please see the informative .pdf brochure to see these features in action.\n\nBe sure to check out the rest of the [Aviano series](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122450/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/aviano/fonts/) which can be used as complementary faces, including Aviano, Aviano Serif, Aviano Sans and Aviano Slab.\n\n",
