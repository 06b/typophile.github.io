  "content": "I'm getting interested in Thai fonts now, and would like to look at some specimen books. I've already found แบบตัวพิมพ์ไทย (Thai Fonts) in digital form ( [PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20141017115531/http:/ftp.opentle.org/pub/national-fonts/FONTBOOK.PDF)) and am wondering if there's any place I can get it in paper form before printing it out myself. I'm also aware of [Theppitak Karoonboonyanan](http://web.archive.org/web/20141017115531/http:/linux.thai.net/~thep/)'s work maintaining the NECTEC fonts for Linux.\n\nBut what I'm _really_ interested in is older, pre-digital specimens of high-quality Thai printing.\n\nI have one gem already in my collection, [Débuts de l'imprimerie en France: L'Imprimerie nationale. L'Hôtel de Rohan](http://web.archive.org/web/20141017115531/http:/books.google.com/books?id=KoZB2IN96ccC) (see p. 160 for the \"Siamois\"). I have some other lower quality samples, like a book on printing \"Foreign Languages\" from the US Government Printing Office, but what I'm looking for is the good stuff, quality metal from the pre-digital era. Specimen books or just well-printed books are all welcome -- I want to do my [averaging trick](http://web.archive.org/web/20141017115531/http:/typophile.com/node/31349) on the smaller sizes of text, and I am in particular interested in optical sizes for Thai, as I think those small loops and curlicues could be more robust in smaller sizes and smaller and more refined in larger.\n\nExamples of excellent calligraphy and penmanship are also most welcome.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

      "content": "I would love guides to finding similar information, i.e., pre-digital specimens of high-quality printing, examples of excellent calligraphy and penmanship, not just for Thai but other writing systems. I say this because I just had this thought looking at Xavier Dupré's Khmer typefaces the other day, and wondered if I should just go find well-printed Khmer books in the library and look at them, even though I don't read Khmer.\n\nI don't imagine I would ever be able to design Khmer letters (I need only to think of all the things non-natives would get wrong trying to design letters in the Korean alphabet), and would be sceptical about the attempts of non-natives, but your averaging trick sounds promising. If one is to design a successful typeface in a writing system one doesn't read natively, your approach is the way to go about it, I think: fresh and well-thought-out revivals of pre-digital quality type.\n\nSome sort of convenient repository of \"quality type and lettering samples\" for different writing systems would be nice. Maybe a job for the TypoWiki?\n\n"

I have only experience of what I've seen, not an appreciation of the historical derivations of the letters (which would help explain the differences between print and handwriting). Approaching type design purely as a linguist not so likely to be successful. Still, it's fascinating ;)\n\n"
