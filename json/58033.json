  "content": "I showed my client Orange Grove from LHF as a possible option for use in his logo. I chose it in particular for the shape of the T, the jagged edges, and the whimsical nature of it (like it's from a storybook). He liked it but I don't think he was sold. He found Wade Grotesque and liked how it has a little more movement because the baseline isn't firm. While the swash version of Wade does have a similar T to what I'm looking for does anyone have other suggestions that somewhat fit this description?\n\n[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/orangegrove.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020151135/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/orangegrove.shtml \"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/orangegrove.shtml\")\n\n[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/wadegrotesque.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020151135/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/wadegrotesque.shtml \"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/wadegrotesque.shtml\")\n\nTIA.\n\n",
