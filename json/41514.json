  "content": "So I posted this typeface back in the summer and I received a lot of help and I think I have finalized it. I'm really happy with the letterforms but I wanted to see what some of you thought. It's obviously a display face and yes it does pay homage to Avant Garde. It was also designed based on a grid.\n\nLet me know what you think. Thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417085944im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Enotmik_6010.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "It looks very interesting to me. I like it!\n\nBut I have some questions:\n\n- Why do the apex and vertex of the letter N end peaked? In my opinion it should be like the M, V and W.  \n- The upper end of the G's throat seems to end above the arms and crossbars of E, F and H.  \n- Why did you fill the bold glyphs' counters? It looks like stencils, but why? It's not what the font looks like.  \n- I think, that the curly braces don't fit in your obvious concept. They don't seem to be created on the grid.\n\nBut nevertheless, I like the font! Especially, I like the M, Y and Q.  \nWhat about the lowercase?\n\n"

      "content": "Alfred, thanks! I'll answer your questions in order.\n\n1. I made the vertices that way on the \"N\" because if I kept it consistent with the M, V and W, the \"N\" looks too wide. It didn't fit in and felt bigger than all the other letterforms. It also makes the N unique.\n\n2. I see what you are saying but I can assure you it's aligned with the E, F and H. It's possibly an optical illusion, which I don't see, but I will explore it.\n\n3. I filled in the counters to give the typeface a unique feature. I like it a lot, especially when the it's used at large sizes, but I'm also considering a version with counters.\n\n4. The curly brackets were created on the grid and use the same corner angles and thickness as the rest of the forms.\n\n5. I tried doing some lowercase letters but they weren't working out well in the grid but I'll revisit it soon.\n\n"
