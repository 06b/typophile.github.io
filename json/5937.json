  "content": "Hi, I'm working on the re-design of a sports magazine. I've decided upon Olsen as the text font and I'm looking for a sans to use for heads, decks and sidebars - and therefore need a font with a variety of weights and itals. At the moment I'm using Trade Gothic Cond for heads and regular for sidebars. I also have Akzidenz, Eurostile, Futura, Helvetica, Interstate, Franklin Gothic, Gil and Univers as possible alternatives. Olsen has double storey a's + g's should my sans have the same? or should it contrast more? Any suggestions from what I already have, or should consider to purchase would be appreciated. thanks.\n\n",
