Corporation\". NovelFonts is a foundry that doesn't exist anymore, and it seems like their business model was to release copycat fonts under slightly different names than the original. I'm having trouble finding the name of the original or its equivalent.\n\nI found a misleading match in the Solotype Catalog which calls this face \"Schadow Antiqua Bold Condensed\" but googling that name is a dead-end; URW Schadow Antiqua is definitely not the same font. Identifont.com didn't get a match, either.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n//john\n\n",

I think the Jaspert 'Encyclopaedia of Type Faces' is a better authority, and it shows 'Schadow Bold Condensed' as identical to Shattuck, as far as I can see.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
