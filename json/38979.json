Veer knows how to build a great stock library, how to market it, and how to sell it. Corbis sucks at most of that (excluding the massive historic image library) and I’m sure that Veer’s success is hurting them. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Corbis stock images moved under the Veer brand with the historic stuff treated as another stock library Veer licenses and sells. As for the type, given the way Corbis has been built up via acquisition, maybe those TYPE stock certificates will become collector’s items in the future…\n\n"

Type is a commodity, like stock illustration, photography, or footage. It’s there to be sold. It’s all about the bottom line. While the Veer type library is “curated” unlike the free-for-all at MyFonts, the result is the same. Another “independent foundry” bites the dust? Don’t make me laugh.\n\n"

I was just waiting for a bit of the dust from last week’s news to settle.\n\nYes, everything is indeed good.\n\nAs an addendum to the clarifications by Nick, Stephen and Ricardo (thank you all), I would like to reinforce the fact that Veer does have a large in-house stock photography production and art department. We are currently building out four brands of photography: Fancy [1], Solus [2], Dear [3], and the Latin-American focused Somos [4].\n\n[1] [http://www.veer.com/fancy/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015071311/http:/www.veer.com/fancy/ \"http://www.veer.com/fancy/\")  \n[2] [http://www.veer.com/solus/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015071311/http:/www.veer.com/solus/ \"http://www.veer.com/solus/\")  \n[3] [http://www.veer.com/dear/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015071311/http:/www.veer.com/dear/ \"http://www.veer.com/dear/\")  \n[4] [http://www.veer.com/somos/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015071311/http:/www.veer.com/somos/ \"http://www.veer.com/somos/\")\n\nAs for typeface development, I am but the sole type designer (of sorts) and technician on staff. However, we work very closely with Jason Walcott on adding new faces to our Jukebox [5] collection. Likewise, Alejandro Paul, Stephen Rapp, Christian Robertson and others are all significant contributors to the exclusive typefaces in our Umbrella [6] library. This year, we acquired the Mean Tangerine [7] foundry for its solid lineup of pixel fonts, and are working with Tyler Young, continuing to build out this great collection. Finally, we just soft-launched Cabinet [8], an embryonic new collection of text and titling faces - Stefan Hattenbach of Macrhino is producing exclusive families for us in this context.\n\n[5] [http://www.veer.com/jukebox/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015071311/http:/www.veer.com/jukebox/ \"http://www.veer.com/jukebox/\")  \n[6] [http://www.veer.com/umbrella/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015071311/http:/www.veer.com/umbrella/ \"http://www.veer.com/umbrella/\")  \n[7] [http://www.veer.com/meantangerine/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015071311/http:/www.veer.com/meantangerine/ \"http://www.veer.com/meantangerine/\")  \n[8] [http://www.veer.com/cabinet/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091015071311/http:/www.veer.com/cabinet/ \"http://www.veer.com/cabinet/\")\n\nSee, we’ve been busy.\n\n**@Jonathan** We’re still cool.
