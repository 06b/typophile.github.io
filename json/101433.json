  "content": "The name _sounded_ familiar.\n\nHe is the designer of the famous typefaces Caledonia and Metro.\n\nBut today I encountered his name in quite another connection.\n\nIn junior high school, in the textbooks we used reflecting the \"New Math\", there was a reference to symbols for \"dek\" and \"el\", representing the duodecimal digits having the values of ten and eleven.\n\nAs it turned out, it was W. A. Dwiggins, who was also an advocate for the use of base-12 instead of decimal, who invented those symbols. Dek, the symbol for ten, is like a capital X, but with the upper left to lower right bar curling over outwards at the ends. El, the symbol for eleven, is an upside-down 3 (the style with a top like that of the 7).\n\n",
