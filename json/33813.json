The site also has a  \n'Found Type' photo section and links to my retail typefaces.\n\n[www.seblester.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012071612/http:/www.seblester.co.uk/ \"www.seblester.co.uk\")\n\nAny constructive feedback, positive or negative,  \nwould be much appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nSeb\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for the input kuroneko and alepaul.\n\nI'm mainly curious about peoples perception of the illustrations,  \nwhich is why I posted the link. I guess you either love or hate  \nthis aesthetic. Much of it can certainly be seen as 'bad, cheesy'  \nbut also I think 'good, kitsch'.\n\nI'm trying to avoid vectors and 3D seems a good starting point,  \nalthough it carries a lot of baggage and it's not a particularly  \n'cool' style at the moment.\n\n\\>the illustrations you’ve made don’t emphasize your caracters...\n\nI guess what I'm trying to do, in some ways, is create images  \nthat make lettering interesting and evocative to a wider audience,  \nrather than just designers. I love stark, simple, black and white  \nimages but I also like the other extreme. Vivid, complex and colourful.\n\n"

      "content": "I understand your point of view and I really hope you will continue to experiment this way. My critic was only based on my personnal tastes which is based on my so called strict, minimalist swiss visual culture. So I'm not really impartial and the fact I don't appreciate something don't means it's bad. Plus, even if I'm not a fanatic of this style, it's evident that your illustrations are really well done and that you work quiet a lot on them. So, goodnight and good luck!\n\n"
