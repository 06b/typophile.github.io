      "content": "I thought about Memphis as well but looked for something closer. Memphis has the angled slab serif to terminate the horizontal strokes for Extra Bold, but not for the weight shown in the image. A font with with the angled slab serif at the right weight is [Adelle Extra Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822042203/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/adelle/) by TypeTogether. The Adelle Extra Bold is lighter the Memphis Extra Bold and narrower, i.e. a better fit to the image. Do a manual slant, shorten the midstoke on E and you should be pretty close.  \nPerhaps someone has an exact match?  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "interesting. i'm sticking with Memphis. i feel the strokes match better, and the lowercase that goes along requires no modification. Adelle's lc does not match the same style. quick sample of Memphis EB with a distortion.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822042203im_/http:/typophile.com/files/memphisfauxitalic_4767.jpg)\n\n"
