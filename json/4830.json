I'm not casting any stones here   \nbecause I neglected to insert the appropriate smileys myself.   \n   \nDear Joseph, I'm serious now: I profusely apologize if   \nwe might've given the impression we were making fun   \nof you, which was certainly not our intention, nor was   \nit to hurt your feelings. I hope you'll forgive us and give   \nthe Typophile Type Identification Board another chance.\n\n"
