My suggestion would be to look through the samples in [part 5 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141509/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg1.html) for something that seems similar in feel. The Supplier codes in the linked Script Font Reference List can help you find who sells the fonts.\n\n"
