  "content": "Hi guys,   \n   \nAs can be followed in earlier threads, I'm working on my type called Nordic. Now I'm sketching on the 'textversion'. It will propably not become a real text face, but it surely should feel like it.   \n   \nCan you give me some good critique. Is this the right direction I'm going? This are some very early sketches where I'm trying to find out if the type work well in the light and the fat extremes. The weights inbetween then propably work as well.   \nI want the fat version to be rounder, like a blown up balloon. The more light the weight, the straighter the verticals. Makes sence?   \nThis is the first time I'm doing a textface so all the tips are welcome. I feel I'm not good in keeping the type consistent in it's details.   \n   \n ![Nordiclight](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307125200im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27217.gif)   \n ![Nordicfat](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307125200im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27218.gif)   \n   \nSee the difference in the light and the fat lc 's'. Would you like it with or without the spurs?   \nI'm not really sure how to handle the horizontals (a, e, g, s). Should they be much thinner than the verticals, as you can see above, or should they be 'equally' thick? That would make it more fat and I would loose a lot of details.   \n   \nThanx,   \nRen\n\n",

That doesn't change my opinion to the three weights though.   \nI made the bowl/stem connections thinner than the other horizontals to reduce stress. Like I said I started off making a font for small sizes. The current thin parts are a leftover from that, but still I think they work because they reduce some weight in a difficult spot in the glyph.   \nThe difficulty here is that I want to keep the diagonals in the font that are the most important characteristics. In the Light you can see them very well. These areas are almost flat and then go over in the bowl. In the Black they become more round so I have to do some optical surgery.   \nNormally I would make a nice thin connection to the stem and then a female round curve to the bowl. Hmm, I love typography. ;-)   \n   \nThanks for the \\*advice\\*, it's very very welcome.\n\n"
