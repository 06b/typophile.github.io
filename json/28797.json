  "content": "Good morning typophiles,\n\nI’m just asking myself whether it is possible in Fontlab 5 to temporarely use shorter names for some glyphs like “Asmall” or “germandbls” while doing metrics.\n\nExample: It is fine to kern uppercase and lowercase:\n\nHHOHHADAHHOHH  \nHHOHHAEAHHOHH  \nHHOHHAFAHHOHH  \n...\n\nnnonnadannonn  \nnnonnaeannonn  \nnnonnafannonn  \n...\n\nThe character of concern can be exchanged very fast.\n\nBut it is almost painful to do so with smallcaps:\n\n/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Asmall/Dsmall/Asmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall  \n/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Asmall/Esmall/Asmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall  \n/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Asmall/Fsmall/Asmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall\n\nTo do this job, it would be nice to say: for the time of beeing, when I say “A” i mean “Asmall”, when I say “B” i mean “Bsmall”, etc.\n\nIs there a way to achieve this, or is there another faster way to to endless spacing and kerning of smallcaps? I’m aware of kerning classes etc. it’s all just about faster program handling...\n\nThanks for your help  \nSebastian\n\n [‹ Illustrator CS2 - Pattern brushes](http://web.archive.org/web/20071031054605/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29077 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [OT replace feature for more glyphs ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071031054605/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29015 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This can be imported into the Metrics window by clicking on the “...” button in the lower right corner and then the folder button in the upper right of the Load Text window.\n\nOnce you import your list of preview strings, you can cycle through them quickly using the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard. You can also select a specific preview string from the pop-up menu to the left of the “...” button in the lower right corner of the Metrics window.\n\nIt can take a while to pre-compose your list of preview strings, but once you do it you can use them as often as you like. It’s a time saver in the long run.\n\n"

I do notice that Garamond Premier Pro does assign a PUA number to all the small caps & oldstyle figures. (And I can’t resist — if 2001 is “ancient,” I must be “decomposed.”)\n\n"

In these terms, OpenType fonts made in 2000 are located in the 280s, which was when the Chinese were the first to use the magnetic compass, and emperor Aurelian invaded Gallia and was trying to conquest Persia.
