  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm looking for a font ID on the rounded typewriter-y font used in the Clark's Shoes 'Enjoy Every Step' campaign.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110521102117im_/http:/typophile.com/files/enjoy_6470.jpg)\n  \nIdentifont and MyFonts came up with Antique Central and 58 Rodeo. They're close but aren't rounded and lack the swashes. I thought that perhaps it was a custom job, but then I saw the second sample whilst browsing through a magazine. It looked close enough to suggest that this could be an actual font.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110521102117im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bliss_5755.jpg)\n  \nAny help gratefully appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n\nBrumble.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [enjoy.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20110521102117/http:/typophile.com/files/enjoy.jpg) | 4.48 KB |\n\n",
