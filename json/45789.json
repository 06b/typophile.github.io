  "content": "I just wrapped up a logo design for a small business that I did for about ten times less than I should have. I offered to do the job for $250 because I thought it would be a quick wordmark for a yoga teacher, it turned out to be a three-part logo with a brandmark, wordmark, and an add-on workmark for a sub-brand. I was really busy and not sleeping much when I agreed to do the work without raising the price (end of semester stuff) and have a contract with the client for $250.\n\nNow the client is happy with the logo and wants to pay extra. The question is: do I tell her not to worry about it knowing that she’s planning to do more business with me, or do I accept the extra cash even though we have a contract?\n\n [‹ moderne display suggestions](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052523/http:/typophile.com/node/46073 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Does this sound like a logo you've seen? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052523/http:/typophile.com/node/45923 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Unless she’s going to double or triple the original bid, I don’t really think it’s worth it (unless you’re really strapped for cash).\n\nNow I’m always a fan of sucking every last penny from a client, but I think this will end up hurting you down the road. It would be better to just call it good at $250, but make it clear to her that this was more or less a freebie with a small stipend. If she gives you $50 extra, she’ll think that she paid you what you’re worth (or whatever arbitrary number she comes up with). And then she’ll expect those same rates down the road.\n\nProbably your best bet is to walk away, unless you think it would be a really great portfolio piece.\n\n"

We have two prices: full price and free. Even friends can understand this one. It should go without saying that if it is a free job, we work just as hard as if we were getting full price.\n\n2. 95 % of the time, for our work — even creative work — we have a price agreed on in advance. Sometime we make a little extra, sometimes we don’t; it averages out in the long run. For that other 5% of the time when I come back & ask for more because of some unforeseen complexities, customers almost always agree. I think this is due in part to that 95% consistency; and in part because they too see that the extra work was needed.\n\nAnd a final thing: very occasionally I quote too high, yet the price is agreed to. In that case, similar to when I have to go back & ask for more, we bill less than the agreed amount. I don’t view this as a change in price so much as a mistake in assessing the complexities of a job, just like the situation where we ask for more.\n\nFWIW\n\n"

Long time lurker & first post :)\n\nComing from a sign design background I have created many logos and various ’marks’ to distinguish local companies and services. I’ve had customers hammer me with re-vamps on designs, and have had them love my first iterations.\n\nThink about all of the time you have put into developing your skills as an artist FIRST. The time that you involved yourself with the customer evolving and constructing the ideas are SECOND. The actual design process is the most enjoyable part of this business but it’s still THIRD.\n\nTake the money James. You’ve worked hard for it. Even if it seems like it was too easy.....It wasn’t. You know that. It seems as though your customer knows as well!\n\nRedo the contract with the yoga teacher. You will most likely benefit from a happy client.\n\ncheers Grant\n\n"

From what James said, the client recognized that the job was worth more than originally agreed and made the offer of more money. He didn’t browbeat her into doing it. Sounds like a great client!\n\nIt is always good to have a contract before starting a job (learned the hard way) but it’s also important to make clear the scope of the job within the contract. If the contract stipulated a wordmark and the job exceeded that description then you would also have been within your right to negotiate for additional money.\n\n"
