I’m thinking I’d have to carefully monitor it though so as to make sure it doesn’t end up breaching any copyright.\n\nThanks for the heads up on that one, maybe they’ll hold a copy at St Martins, I’ll have to give them a go next time I’m in.\n\n"

      "content": "Chris,\n\nNot sure which direction you want this to come from: Is it about typefaces, and examples of them in use, or is it about graphic design, with extra info about typefaces used? The first is a resource I think everyone would welcome, and the rights and permissions of that shouldn’t be terribly restrictive. The second sounds like a portfolio site, with lots of feedback, bickering and contention, and also doesn’t sound like something people need. I see no need for “judging” or other ratings or feedback; that sounds like it goes against the intention of a resource that helps people understand how typefaces perform. Who cares which one is your favorite? I think what people need is a place to see how type looks in various settings, and what it can do for them, before they buy it. Is that what you’re thinking of?\n\nIf it’s about the typefaces rather than the products using them, then you do have the challenge of selecting faces to feature. Over time, you could have a lot of typefaces in the library. But every free, grunge, and rip-off face doesn’t need a page of examples. Newer designs without a lot of popular exposure could very much benefit from this kind of demonstration/example site. People are always asking for specimens, and asking if anyone has used a particular face, and how well it works.\n\n"

It’s not about favorites or style...the proposed star ratings would be about “this is a good (as in the type is approriate and set correctly) example” and this example is “not as good.” This would only be necessary if it was an open portfolio like Flickr, which would undoubtedly attract posters of varying skill, knowledge, and experience, and likely be heavy with lesser experienced students and amateurs who cannot wait to see their work posted on the site.\n\nI’ll assume that people who know what they’re doing wouldn’t need this resource and wouldn’t have much time to dedicate to it.\n\nAll of a sudden this is beginning to sound like a train wreck.\n\nBut maybe if it was typographers rating the use of type in work done by designers, there’d be some shared interest among both professional communities.\n\n"

The more open you want the community, the more open you have to allow submissions to be. The more closed, the more administrative time and effort that would go into maintaining it all and filtering the submissions in some objective fashion.\n\nRemember that a rating system is only as good as the knowledge of the raters. ;o)\n\n"

      "content": "In terms of judging, I think it would be closer to moderating, more of whether a piece is a suitable example of that typeface in use as opposed to the personal preference of the viewer. If means and time allowing there was a want for it to open up to provide extra resource for other disciplines, then that is something that I would have to consider.\n\nThe main idea for now is to have a central reference for design, focusing heavily on the typography and how it is used in context, not just to help judge the suitability or the usability of a typeface you might be considering for a piece, but also as a permanent record of that typeface and a research/teaching resource for students and academia (although I could see it open to all sorts of ’find this typeface’ assignment abuse). I wouldn’t want it to end up purely as an extended marketing tool for the type foundries, although I think if they were interested they could be invaluable to enriching the user experience.\n\nI would like the focus when concerned with submissions to be more towards established studios/designers/typographers/etc. but I don’t see it as unfeasible to have an ’education’ section that works with universities to provide coverage of their degree shows, this way I would hope that the students might use the resource and then be showing, hopefully work that in some way has benefited from it. Also bearing in mind that todays students are tomorrows designers and with luck they would as they progress add to the library and essentially be giving something back to the design community.\n\n"
