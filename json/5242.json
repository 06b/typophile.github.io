  "content": "Hi guys,   \n   \nI incountered a very annoying error in InDesign. I created a layered font called Kryptonite. It exists out of 3 layers that on top of eachother form a font that resembles the logo I ones created for a client.   \nThe correct order in which the have to be stapled is: A (Blue), B (Green) and C (White).   \n   \nIn QuarkXpress (yak) the fonts are perfect, but in InDesign (jummy) it seems like the baselines are shift. The font doesn't fit anymore.   \nI checked in FOG but everything is consistent. Has anyone had this error too? I know it's a problem that you don't encounter unless you use a font like this, but perhaps someone knows.   \n   \nIn this image you can see what happens. The upper one is Quark and the lower one InDesign.   \n   \n ![Kryptonite error](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110140756im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/38482.jpg)   \n   \nPlease help, because I spent a whole lot of time getting this font to fit properly.   \n   \nThanks,   \nRen�\n\n",

Also, make sure the leading is the same for all three text boxes.   \n   \nBTW, I wouldn't call this an error so much as an inconvenient default setting. Quark has a similar setting (I seem to recall) which used to default to the same thing. They must have changed it at some point, or perhaps your Quark default setting is different.\n\n"

Thanks Kent.   \n   \n\\> but I think it will work better if you set the First Baseline Offset to \"Leading\".   \n   \nNot really. This will put the text much deeper in the text box, so it looks 'wrong' to me. The option from Kent 'looks' better. I don't know whether it's also effectively better.   \n   \n\\> I would make the logo as a whole identity, in Illustrator.   \n   \nAlessandro, it is already a logo, I made a font out of it afterwords.   \n   \nThanks guys for the great help.   \n   \n�\n\n"
