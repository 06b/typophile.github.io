      "content": "The letters /d f o v w/ look weird because they violate pen logic, i.e., the placement of thick and thin diagonals is inverted. Likewise, the orientation of the semi-serifs seems haphazard; I imagine making them consistent (to the left on top, to the right on the bottom) would help the font find its rhythm.\n\nThe small ball terminals in /c e g s y/ and, to a lesser degree, in /a f j/, look like they'd benefit from a bit more weight.\n\nThe /t looks like it's about to fall over. The /z feels out of place.\n\n"
