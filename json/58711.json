From the dozen or so hand drawn letters found in that source we have constructed a family of Roman faces for display and text work, with bold weights, an italic form as well as condensed, small capital and title forms, all (hopefully!) preserving the fun of their inspiration. Here's a sample of Clementhorpe 'in action':\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020144911im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Clementhorpe_Gallery1_3851.png)\n\nWe've just posted further samples on our [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020144911/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\nWe intend the Clementhorpe family to provide a complete solution for early 20th century inspired design work with Character, offering all the faces needed to complete a project or a range of projects within the one type family.\n\nThis is our largest family to date, with twelve faces-one of which, the italic form, is available free on [MyFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020144911/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/clementhorpe/).\n\n",
