Even though some of the information in the book might be considered outdated nowadays, the chapters on book design, the parts of a book, paper, lettering, calligraphy, and printing are all useful. And I, for one, think that even the “outdated” parts are still useful, the same way that I find it useful to know where terms like [leading](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208191505/http:/typophile.com/wiki/leading) come from.\n\n[EDIT] P.S.: Bear in mind that the book’s author, Ruari McLean, was British, so you’ll encounter terms like “jobbing” throughout the text.\n\n"
