  "content": "Hello   \nI am a student and we are using fontagrapher to create our font. One other student and I are having problems with kerning. We kern our pairs. When we go to gernerate our fonts, the kerninng does not appear. It is like we kerned nothing. I have some kerning pairs, I don't think that it is too many. Heather the other girl has alot of kerning pairs. Our teacher and us are at a loss what to do next. Any ideas?   \n   \nLisa   \n  \nPS Heather also asked me to ask if anyone knows why her letters are appearing smaller than what the point size says.\n\n",
