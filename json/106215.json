  "content": "Dear Typophile forum,\n\nDoes anyone know of a foundry that could help with internationalising a typeface (5 fonts)?  \nTo start with, I would need all Latin based characters:  \nLatin Extended Additional  \nLatin Extended-A  \nLatin Extended-B  \nLatin Extended-C  \nLatin Extended-D  \n(= 500 new glyphs).\n\nPerhaps also Russin, Ukranian, Kazhak, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Mongolian, Uzbek, Greek, Hebrew, Kurdish, Arabic, Farsi, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Hindi.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
