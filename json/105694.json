      "content": "That is an unusual face and probably would make a nice revival if enough resource material is available. I do believe it is hand-set rather than by machine.\n\nI looked through my foreign foundry specimens (French and British) but cannot locate it, nor in the US foundries either. I'm uncertain as to where a Romanian book publisher of that era would go for type, perhaps a Russian foundry. Unfortunately I cannot find a Russian foundry specimen book.\n\nIf you do identify it, please post the name here for our information. In the meantime I will keep it on my list of to-be-identifieds.\n\n"

Your sample has some good earmark letters -- such as the A, f and e -- that might trigger some digging. If you have more text, particularly if it has letters such as R, K, G, M, Q and W, it would be helpful if you included that in your post.  \nDon\n\n"
