The class is seventy two hours in eight weeks. My great desire is to teach them true classic design including elegant and legible typography. Does anyone have syllabuses, lesson plans, pointers, warnings, and resources, which may help. If so, I would be grateful.\n\n",

I know of type rules and will look up the other two. I also liked the “the form of the book” Jan Tschichold. what do you think of it?\n\nThank you both,  \nPsachyah\n\n"
