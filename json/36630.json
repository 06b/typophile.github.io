Does anyone know how to reset the default document so I can change the units to inches instead?\n\nAlso, while I’m at it, I might as well change some other preferences. Anyone want to make a suggestion on other things I should probably change, maybe the baseline grid and increments.\n\n [‹ ITC Avant Garde Gothic Not Avant Garde Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021040311/http:/typophile.com/node/36627 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Dramatic, slightly scary and a little intimidating: any ideas? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021040311/http:/typophile.com/node/36614 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
