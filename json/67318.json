  "content": "I am working on a redesign for a science magazine/journal and we need a sans serif font with as big a glyph set as possible, including Greeks and quantum symbols and as much math as possible.\n\nIdeally this font would also look amazing as a display face, however I think we all agree that this is basically impossible.\n\nSo....what I am looking for is a sans serif with a million bazillion characters that will work well in italic, regular, bold and bold italics (because each of those things means something in science). I am going to try to use it for any sans serif body copy and then insert it in if it needs to be in the display area. It would help me if it had a condensed weight too since I am using one of the more condensed widths of Knockout for the display copy right now and don't really want to change it if I can help it (I'm rather attached to it actually).\n\nAny ideas?\n\nHelp quadruply appreciated....\n\nthanks,  \nryan\n\n",
