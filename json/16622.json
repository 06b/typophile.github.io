I’ve never really ventured into drawing a ‘custom’ script so I tried it with my name. Thoughts? I know it still needs refining but general ideas about it would be awesome! Critiques, opinions, thoughts, comments etc are all welcome!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/davebaileyscript2ok.gif)\n\n",

This caught my eye, and begged me to post my thoughts.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the “ave” and the “iley” look like separate designs. The “ave” has a twisted, unconventional feel to it, while “iley” looks like more of a traditional script. Also, the curly piece at the top of the “D” looks a bit forced, I like how the “B” looks and would try and model the “D” after it. The dot on the “i” is awesome, make sure you keep it as this progresses. I would love to see this deveop into a finished piece, please continue posting your updates.\n\nTravis\n\n"

      "content": "David, I think you’re on to something really unique with the a, and v in Dave. The other characters look more like traditional sign painter script. So, I agree with Travis that the characters don’t really flow well together yet, but it’s a good start.\n\nHaving said that, I’ve doodled a lot of script letters myself for fun, and they are deceptively hard to do.\n\n"

I put it on the backburner after there seemed to be no interest in it…\n\nTravis: I’ll get rid of the curly bit at the top of the D, because I’ve had thoughts about it feeling forced but your response confirms it. I fell in love with the dot over the “i” too…probably my favorite part of the design. It’s funny how the smallest things can become the most exciting!\n\nChris: So it seems as if I should try to rethink this based on the “a” and “v”?\n\n"

My boss who oversees all the creative work, both print and video is awesome as well. I often find myself staying late even though I’m not getting paid. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to go back to school in the spring. :-/ The lack of monetary income is the only downside. Manhattan has been a great expereience, beside the fact that I can’t freakin find another part time job….so many résumés and interviews but still nothing. It’s a good thing I had a decent savings before I got here.\n\nI hope to make a good judgement on this city by the time I leave and then after school spend some time on the west coast (San Francisco area) since a good portion of the design industry seems to be happening out there now. That is all dependednt on me finding a job etc, still too far away to really plan for though! Thanks for asking!\n\n"

I just don’t recall having seen something like that. So it almost seems like there are 2 different ideas happening there. Good luck with it, it’s a good start.\n\n"

I wish I had the time and ambition for stuff like this! :)\n\nLovin’ the ‘_ave_’ even more now … but the ‘_D_’ still seems divorced from the word somehow to me. Sharp pointy stroke ends, maybe? Verticals too swooping to the left? I can’t quite put a finger on it.\n\n"

      "content": "To me the stress needs to go on the top right corner of the a on the inside of the open counter. The joins still need something to raise them, maybe you could investigate how they change if you try painting this up with a brush and ink. Load up the brush and try repeating one group of letters at a time (ave & ailey) until you get a really smooth fast movement, I suspect the joins on ave are too contrived, because those of ailey work better and that the painting exercise will give you more modulation of stroke.  \nTim\n\n"
