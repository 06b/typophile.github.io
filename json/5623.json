Note that the S is different from the one in \"Square.\" The one in \"OBSCURE\" is the real Bank Gothic S. They must have simply customized it for that one logo and used it as is for the rest of the magazine.\n\n"

I used four white rectangles to modify the S (2 places) and the two E's, by hiding parts of them. I used 2 red rectangles to make the bars for the E's, and I used a black rectangle to add a tail to an O to make the Q.   \n ![SquareEnixSimulation](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110141120im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40744.gif)\n\n"

The [Bitstream version](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110141120/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/) seems slightly wider than the [E&F version](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110141120/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/bank-gothic-ef/) -- maybe this is based off of E&F's. Another possibility is [Banque Gothique RR](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110141120/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/banque-gothique-rr/), but this one seems wider also.\n\n"
