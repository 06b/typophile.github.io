(There's also no way anyone would make a mockery of this subject in Thailand.)\n\nThough this recycled-Latin chic is really common on Thai versions of Hollywood movie posters, I find it really fascinating that they'd choose to use not a single Thai letter for such a national occasion. Clearly all these glyphs are Latin characters reappropriated (with one modification, the V is stretched asymetrically to form ง.) I just love the unapologetic way the parenthesis and comma are used for the vowel mark ิ and tail of ญ respectively, it's just so naive and cheeky, and bizarre!

If this sort of faux-Latin Thai were used for text typography, even if the people of Siam were able to read it, I doubt it would fly.\n\nThe Indic scripts, although very diverse visually, approach isomorphism in structure - most of them can be used to write Sanskrit, although they may include additional letters for that purpose not used in writing the languages to which they belong.\n\nOne could imagine, therefore, that eventually one single script might replace the existing scripts used from Tibet to Thailand, from Sri Lanka to Laos. I don't think that's particularly likely, as a common script won't do much to surmount the language barriers in that region, and in today's age of digital fonts and laser printers, it's not as if supporting different scripts is an intolerable economic burden somewhere.\n\n"

The Thai script is especially adaptable and as we saw this week in the Flickr group [Cross-script letterforms](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102325/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/cross-script-letterforms/pool/), it can withstand not only Latinisation, but Hangeulisation, Sinification, Japaneseification, Bengalification and Devanagarisation. Thai popular culture loves imitation, it's not really a question of foreign things being better, rather that there are things outside of Thailand that Thais want to appropriate and offer their own unique take on. It's more a question of pick'n'mix than pushing things in any one direction. That makes it often very indiscriminate and muddled, superficial and nonsensical, but also very fast-moving, vibrant, non-judging and fun.\n\nI like the comparison with Morison and wonder about how he would have approached Thai. We'll never know of course, but looking at the way he brutalised Greek I have some ideas. His approach seems to have been very sober and practical, using a repertoire of Latin-ish shapes to compensate for a lack of understanding of Greek letterforms. I don't think he would have had the guts or the imagination to go anywhere near this far. Yes, this recycled/repurposed Latin Thai is reckless, but I find it somehow delightful in its complete abandonment of Thai shapes. In a way, they demonstrate such familiarity with Thai letterforms that they can be done away with, abstracted so far that they're not there at all: their presence must be inferred from the Latin letters that stand in their place. To me, the way this is executed is something only a Thai designer could have come up with, which paradoxically makes the whole thing quintessentially Thai.\n\n"

      "content": "I can certainly appreciate the benefits of joyful imitation; it's something that has made Western cultures richer, hence stronger. I do fear however that imitation can be used to [mis]guide discontent. Right now for instance there's a vacuum of governance in Thailand, and people in power can use visual language to push the country in a political direction that suits them, to the detriment of culture. This includes co-opting well-intended imitation to eventually make even Thai text fonts copy the forms of Latin with little regard to what they actually need to be doing, culturally, functionally.\n\nBasically to me any design effort comes with responsibility, beyond the personal joy it brings. Back when I myself used to make Latinized Armenian fonts, I was so happy with and proud of my \"formal gymnastics\" of moving shapes around; but then I realized that was a very superficial approach and opened my eyes to the damage I was doing, without however reverting to the conservatism of blindly reviving tradition. That said, it's certainly a tough balancing act, which I will never completely master.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "As I noted in another thread, I'm beginning to get an understanding of what is going on. Chanik Aramian apparently came up with the earliest influential Latinized Armenian face, and it looks as though he did so because the traditional faces seemed to need a breath of fresh air.\n\nFrom what I've learned earlier about conditions in the diaspora as against the homeland, it looks, though, like there's going to be little demand for better Armenian typefaces. The homeland doesn't see anything amiss with heavily Latinized faces - they're what they're used to.\n\n(Although the phonetics of Western Armenian, unlike Eastern Armenian, are such that it doesn't _need_ all the letters of the Armenian alphabet - Latin would be adequate for _that_ version of the language - at least there is no danger of that happening. The influence of the church, a naturally conservative institution, contributes heavily to the survival of the Armenian language at all in the diaspora.)\n\nSome of the diaspora prefers the traditional faces without change, and some of it apparently doesn't mind the Latinized versions. Without demand in the community, expecting Monotype or Microsoft or Google to see that anything's wrong is difficult.\n\nStill, typefaces that attempt to meet your goals may sneak in to Google's font collection, and _maybe_ they'll even get noticed.\n\n"

It's about stylistic translations from one script to the other. Certainly you couldn't call the Thai design above a stylistic translation. In fact, there is a total disregard for any translation. It simply uses symbols to mean something entirely different. It's conversion rather than translation.\n\n"
