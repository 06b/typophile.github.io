  "content": "Does anyone have intelligence (or heard rumors) about which fonts will be bundled with Adobe CS5?\n\nMeanwhile, I've been auditing installed fonts at computer labs in a couple of institutions (as well as on my own Macs), and was hoping to get a handy list of which fonts shipped with which versions of Adobe CS. I remembered there had been conversations here about this, so I poked around and figured it might be useful to re-post Thomas Phinney's lists from his Typblography (thanks again, Thomas):\n\nFonts that shipped with CS3  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/04/cs3\\_bundled\\_fon.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619215054/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/04/cs3_bundled_fon.html \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/04/cs3\\_bundled\\_fon.html\")\n\nFonts that shipped with CS4  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/09/cs4\\_fonts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619215054/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/09/cs4_fonts.html \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/09/cs4\\_fonts.html\")\n\nI'm left with some questions -- like, did Warnock Pro or Brioso Pro fonts ever ship bundled with other Adobe products? How'd they get on these lab computers!? Cussed pirates!\n\n- Matthew\n\n",
