  "content": "Hello everyone. First time posting on this forum and was wondering if i could get some help. I tried doing a search but have had no luck in finding these fonts.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knows of what both of these fonts are? Both the cursive and typeface. Or anything similar.\n\nSorry for the terrible pictures. It looks better zoomed out lol.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks :)\n\n-Kristina\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011190425im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%201%20(1)_6160.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011190425im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%201_5813.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011190425im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%202%20(2)_6413.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011190425im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%203%20(1)_3792.JPG)\n\n",
