  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m wondering if anyone has ANY information on the Swiss typographer Marcel Nebel. I’ve only seen two samples of his work (circa early 70s), but am in love with it. If anyone knows anything, or any tips- I’d be deeply thankful.\n\nBest regards,  \nNorman\n\n [‹ Who designed the 4AD record company logo?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011161121/http:/typophile.com/node/17770 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Freight frightens ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011161121/http:/typophile.com/node/17272 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
