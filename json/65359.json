  "content": "Type ID Cold Case Files: February 2009\n\nRound Two, everyone! Digging through the archives, I've rounded up a number of zero-response Type ID requests. This batch is from February 2009. Surely there are some here that we can close out, right?\n\nIf you solve one, respond on the respective thread and let us know back here so we can track the results and see who's top of the board. Also see: [Cold Case Files: January 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202121948/http:/typophile.com/node/65293) which still has a number of unsolved cases.\n\nWe'll start the clock at the date/time of this posting.\n\nReady..
