      "content": "Initial reaction is they look good, points I would look at are the vertical stroke of the R I feel it should flare to the left rather than right and possibly work in a closed loop where the counter and leg meet; work on the second o – it is slightly cramped; slightly close up the fto combination; try a thinner connecting stroke on op or maybe a more exuberant stroke – it is rather straight compared with some of the others; and possibly make the counter of the p a little wider.\n\nTim\n\n"

      "content": "I think it's really nice. I agree with Tim to spend some time on the second o. In addition I think the space between t and o is much to wide.\n\nBest,  \nJuergen\n\n"

      "content": "my take:  \ni like the R in version 3 better than versions 1 or 2. i don't think its flare is a problem - rather it feels in keeping with the movement of the rest of the type. again, second 'o' needs tweaking, as others said.\n\n"

      "content": "I vote number two but i would move the \"top\" slightly the to the left and fix the P at the end as it's starting to look a little too much like an R to me. Really just my taste I suppose. Other than that I think it looks really great.\n\n"
