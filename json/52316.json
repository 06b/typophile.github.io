Nothing screws up a design job interview like the following:\n\n“Do you know Flash?”\n\n_Nope._\n\n“Dreamweaver?”\n\n_No._\n\n“Javascript?”\n\n_Nada._\n\n“So aside from Indesign and Photoshop, what software are you good at?”\n\n_Fontlab._\n\n“Fontlab? Ummmm…right.”\n\nOn the upside, I guess this keeps out of dead-end web production jobs.\n\n",
