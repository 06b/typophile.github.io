  "content": "Just wondering if there is any foundry that produces Palatino (or a close enough typeface that could masquerade as it) in a medium weight and includes old-style figures (and preferably true small caps)?\n\nI require them for a few samples of light on dark text. I have actually created my own versions of the figures in Illustrator, but have never created a font before and don't want to put in all the work for this project if I don't have to.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I'm guessing Palatino nova will be the closest find, any others?\n\n",

      "content": "You're both correct, the original Palatino and the Windows shipping Palatino Linotype both include old-style figures and small caps (I use the latter regularly). The problem is they only come in their regular and bold weights. Every Medium weight I've come across so far has only ever included the default lining figures. This is what I'm after.\n\nMy own attempt in Illustrator was actually done by average the regular and bold weighted versions. Probably a major typography no-no! Of course this makes the hunt for a legitimate copy even more important! :D\n\n"

      "content": "Sure, but I've just presumed that my untrained eye simply can't see the differences between Palatino and Nova and that if an original Palatino exists with these features then surely it would be better (again, even if I can't see the subtle improvement myself).\n\nSo if I have the type experts confirmation that Nova is good enough and I wont be causing a typographic sin by mixing Palatino nova into an existing promotional environment of Palatino Linotype then I'll go shell out the cash for it! :D\n\n"
