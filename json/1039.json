Icame across the term in an essay by   \n Stanley Morrison,and have heard the term thrown   \n about in 'type' class without any concrete reason for it's   \nuse. It occured to me that it may have come about   \nbecause they literally look line hairlines when printed   \nat smaller pt sizes.   \n   \nI would love some clarification!\n\n",

Rule (lines) were cast at a minimum of one-point but the printing surface could be much narrower.   \n   \nI've printed cat whiskers. Real cat whiskers. Very nice gradation!!!   \n   \nGerald\n\n"
