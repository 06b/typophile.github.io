In the late 1940s, she started teaching at the Städel School of Art in Frankfurt. A typeface that she had been working on since the 1930s, [Diotima](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921062427/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Diotima), was released by [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921062427/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) around this time. Somehow, she must have met the chief in-house type designer there ( [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921062427/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf)), as they were married in the early 1950s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Gudrun Zapf von Hesse began designing typefaces again. She released several typefaces through [URW](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921062427/http:/typophile.com/wiki/URW), [Bitstream](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921062427/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bitstream), [Berthold](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921062427/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Berthold), and [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921062427/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype).\n\nShe lives with her husband in Darmstadt, Germany. The Zapfs have a beautiful house, full of typographic treats.\n\n[All of Gudrun Zapf von Hesse's Linotype faces are available on this overview page at the Linotype Website](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921062427/http:/www.linotype.com/7-647-7-16331/gudrunzapfvonhesse.html)\n\n",
