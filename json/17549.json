How do you people feel about mixing stresses within a font — I’m interested specifically in serifs (and display at that), but it is something that applies to sans aswell. I have seen a few text faces where stress fluctuates anywhere between the vertical and diagonal, and I have assumed this to be for readability reasons (that it creates a more varied letter shape for the reader’s eye, and helps maintain interest). Is it a mortal sin, amongst the purists at least, to do this? Theoretically it is against the grain of consistency in a font, but do you think it is enough for other constants like weight, and proportion to maintain harmony? On top of this, I lean towards mixing forms derived from various genres into fonts — this is not to say I don’t believe that forms should sing in harmony together. I suppose my methodoly could be seen as what Peter Bilak calls ’chirographic’.\n\n [‹ Grotesque or Gothic?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423050933/http:/typophile.com/node/17409 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type and the Olympics ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423050933/http:/typophile.com/node/15401 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
