Its compact range of styles has been designed for easy use by non-designers in offices of legal and academic institutions, and corporate environments. Eskorte supports Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, and over ninety languages using the Latin script.\n\nThe various styles were designed together, resulting in a smooth, coherent style across the family. The italics take on livelier, more fluid forms that echo the design of the Arabic, allowing them to sit perfectly together, while the extrabold adds punch to official announcements and notices.\n\nThe Arabic was designed in consultation with Titus Nemeth.  \nFor more unformation visit our site: [http://rosettatype.com/eskorte](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415021515/http:/rosettatype.com/eskorte)\n\n**The introductory price of Eskorte Arabic is only 68 €/font!**\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415021515im_/http:/typophile.com/files/eskorte1-5_4107.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415021515im_/http:/typophile.com/files/eskorte1-6_4327.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415021515im_/http:/typophile.com/files/eskorte1-7_4768.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415021515im_/http:/typophile.com/files/eskorte1-8_6578.png)\n\n",
