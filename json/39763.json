  "content": "Hi everyone  \nI've seen “Schoolbook” versions of Monotype faces (notably Plantin, Bembo and Gill Sans) pop up here and there in the past few years (indeed, I think this fashion has already been discussed on this forum) but I can't find any piece of information about the origins of these particular fonts. Were they hot metal fonts before \"going digital” ? When were they designed, and by whom ?\n\n",
