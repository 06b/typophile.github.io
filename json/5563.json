With Adobe CS apps I activate in Suitcase, switch back to app, font not there, click outside text box, click inside again, font appears.   \n   \n\\* Any other apps, you don't get autoactivation anyway (I don't run Quark) and must quit and relaunch.   \n   \n\\* It regularly hangs, and likes to take down other apps with it.   \n   \n   \nThis is on a dual G5 with up to date patches, btw.   \n   \nHaving said all this, I'm not sure there's anything better than Suitcase out there. Being a large(ish) company, it's likely Extensis will get there act together sometime soon.\n\n"

I am a little leery of Suitcase because of pre OSX issues and what I am hearing about the OSX version. Also one thing that bothers me about Extensis is they have bolted together a solution from three different products and my past experience with companies who buy code is they tend to not support it well in the future.   \n  \nRight now I am leaning toward two possible solutions, Font Agent Pro for repair/management/display.   \nor   \nFontDoctor (was Morrison SoftDesign\n\n"

To me it works very much like the old ATM Deluxe that had so many fans back in pre-X days.\n\nI think MJ's biggest advantage is not building its own database of the fonts. It just turns them on and off, anywhere they are located, and it doesn't have to be running all the time. Launch, active your fonts, quit. It does lack an auto-activation, but I was told by Alsoft that that would be in an upgrade. I fear that the upgrade may be a long wait since MJ is definitly a cult font manager at this point.\n\nJames\n\n10.4.2 with the CS suite\n\n"

FontExplorer adds some iTunes-like features, like making new sets from any fonts already activated or added.\n\nI use font managers to test fonts in development, so my usage is probably different from that of most graphic designers, but the convenience of activation is the big hook for me, and that's useful to anyone with a lot of fonts they don't want installed permanently.\n\n"
