Slanted is normally used for letters, words or fonts being skewed ‘electronically’ i.e. by means of simple software modification and without any optical compensation. Or have I missed something?  \nWhen you refer to the serifs in C and E, I’d say something like: the diagonal serifs in C and E. Or are you pointing at something else?\n\n"

I was indeed referring to the diagonal serifs in C and E.\n\n"
