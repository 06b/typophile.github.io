  "content": "I actually did this over a year ago, but haven't bothered to put it online for critique... until now.  \nI took the inspiration for this project from the word bitmap itself. The idea behind it is to create a dingbatfont with all varieties of intersecting roads in angles of 45° to enable the user to create actual 'bitmaps'. Think of it as Lego for typophiles ;-)  \nIn addition, I also made another dingbatfont with pictograms you often find on maps (buildings, vehicles, vegetation,...) along with some other commonly used pictograms (communication, transport, office,...).  \nOfcourse I felt obliged to make an actual font to go with it of which I have done several varieties. By now, I'm actually not too happy with the script & flip version, but I'll include them anyway.  \nI'll also include 2 examples; the first of a 'bitmap' I made of my hometown & the 2nd of several illustrations I made with the bitmapfont for a personal pixelfont project called 'Dressed in Letter'.  \nThe grid for the bitmap font was 7x7 pixels (which obviously might make some of the dingbats a little hard to recognise; for those of you who are wondering, the dingbat next to the penguin in the first row is a superhero ;-) ), but I might make a bigger version in the future.  \nThis was a lot of fun to do; both the fonts & the illustrations & I hope you'll all enjoy it just as much as I did!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Bitmap.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414063353/http:/typophile.com/files/Bitmap.gif) | 6.69 KB |\n| [Bitbet.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414063353/http:/typophile.com/files/Bitbet.gif) | 12.26 KB |\n| [Example.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414063353/http:/typophile.com/files/Example.gif) | 1.53 KB |\n| [Example2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414063353/http:/typophile.com/files/Example2.gif) | 2.57 KB |\n\n",
