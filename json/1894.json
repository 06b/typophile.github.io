  "content": "Hello Folks,   \nI have had fun trying to ID these two fonts today. The client said they were Modena and Verona (the word \"Australia\" is Verona and the rest is Modena). Looks like they are brand new fonts out of the UK. I saw a reference on Bowfin Printworks that Mike Yanega had supplied a sample of Modena. Hello Mike. A nice lady on MyFonts.com told me that these fonts are both made by Miles Newlyn from [http://www.x-and-y.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20090812131955/http:/www.x-and-y.co.uk/) (the site is not up yet). Can anyone confirm that these two fonts are indeed Verona and Modena from X-and-Y Co? The main question is this - how can I buy them?? ![modena-verona](http://web.archive.org/web/20090812131955im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19576.gif)\n\n",
