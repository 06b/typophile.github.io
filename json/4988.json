But it's the first font (that I know of) that deliberately and intelligently breaks the domination of the Black. It's the first \"notanic\" typeface, where the importance of the White is given more than mere lip-service; it creates bonds in the White, hence promoting boumas. In this way it breaks the biggest barrier towards optimal text type.   \n   \nWhich isn't to say I think it's perfect - in fact it has a serious drawback - it's a _constructed_ font. It's basically too Modernist, too regular.

Human beings are better at reading than any improvement at the type design level can significantly affect.

So it's a matter of context, and a good craftsman needs to be very concerned with the smallest of gains - they are \"significant\" to him, as a person creating quality objects, if for no other reason than because that justifies his existence, because it makes him happy. It is in the context of our individuality that any of this is \"significant\" - otherwise there are _extremely_ few really \"significant\" reasons to make new fonts. Plus that effort is usually better spent elsewhere anyway!   \n   \nWas it \"significant\" to use an esoteric pen to make SBL Hebrew\\*? Who the hell would have noticed any difference? And then you claim \"enhanced dissimilation between similar Hebrew letters\", but when needed you say it doesn't matter? And then you put the top-right spur on the final-kaf anyway, even though that's exactly opposite of the claim! Only the most conservative fonts -the ones that don't worry about dissimilation- do that. I honestly don't know what to think about the aggregate of your opinions on functionality. It really seems that you're just giving people what they _expect_, depending on context. Sure, expectation is part of functionality too, but there has to be an overall rhyme and reason, at least on the personal level - otherwise it's just reactionary.   \n   \n\\* Although when it seems necessary you tend to claim that the pen didn't influence the result...   \n   \nAnd then I have to repeat this yet again, apprently: There is a difference between what people think they can read comfortably versus what they can read comfortably for extended periods, without even realizing. It is in the latter arena that a good craftsman is most concerned. It is in the _promotion_ of efficiency, not the assumption of its irrelevance, that good design is best expressed. People don't read \"fast enough\" [partly] because of bad typography (and type), not because they can't read any faster. That's why using a serif font for a book matters for example.

Or maybe you should be _writing_ book? And since conveying information to people is intended to help them, I might propose that you forget typography entirely, and concentrate on what the bulk of the human population is severly lacking and truly needs: not books, but food and decency!! Who was more significant, Claude Garamont or Rachel Corrie? Or Mother Teresa?! Who gives a crap about Garamont.   \n   \nBut in order to propose such things I would need to ignore what _you_ need out of life - what is in _your nature_.

Some typefaces model the transition from the horizontal to the vertical on the dalet (spurred) others on the resh (rounded), a few use a hybrid approach. Zvi Narkiss developed a neo-Sepharidic style that tends to favour the rounded form, and I admire his types very much, but in SBL Hebrew I decided to follow a more traditionally typographic, less cursive form. User expectation is one consideration, yes, because the users are Biblical scholars most of whom are familiar with only one or two other Hebrew typefaces (shifting from an 19th century Ashkenazic style to a Sephardic one was enough of a shock for some of them when they first saw SBL Hebrew). However, the other functional consideration -- and this is something that should be right up your street -- is that more words in the Biblical text end in resh than in dalet, therefore it seems more important to distinguish the final kaf from resh than from dalet.\n\n"

On the other hand, I think I will always get annoyed when a type designer claims that readability simply doesn't matter outright, and (to a lesser extent) when a user doesn't appreciate the difference between a designer who cares about fine-tuning readability and one who doesn't.   \n   \nBTW, I don't think it's \"obsessive\", because I know that it's just one factor - which is the reason for example that some glyphs in Patria (like the \"a\" and \"e\") have intentionally sub-optimal readability, to promote the \"robust\" character of the face. And like I've said before, one reason I drone on about readability is that so few other people do, and so many other people want it not to matter.   \n   \n\\> you would prefer to confuse the final kaf with the resh rather than with the dalet?   \n   \nI actually don't know enough myself (what are the relative frequencies, especially wrt position?), I'm actually mostly referring to what \"native\" Hebrew designers (who have an innate linguistic sensitivity that we don't) are doing: it's not just one Narkiss font - the font in the Unicode table, Friedlaender's popular Hadassah of the late 50s, and every single Hebrew font in Bukvaraz\\*, with the highly notable exception of the hyper-conservative Nathan, uses the \"soft-corner\" form.   \n   \n\\* Even the super-blocky Atzmaut.   \n   \nAnd considering you're such a good researcher, I have to think that you knew about this general trend, but you either thought it's wrong, or you thought that in this case the spurred form makes more sense. Both could be valid, but the second one simply doesn't jibe with dissimilitude (as far as I can tell), which in turn doesn't jibe with what you've said in this thread!   \n   \n\\> The distinguishing feature of the final kaf is its descender   \n   \nBut the descender space is so weak in Hebrew - it doesn't seem safe to rely on it. But it depends -again- on the difference between legibility and readability. Sure, when you give a person many seconds to decide what a glyph is, there's no problem - there almost never is. But there are much more severe requirements of decipherability during high-speed immersive reading. Just like how an \"rn\" can be read as an \"m\" in English text - but only during immersion. And this is also why typos go unnoticed so frequently.   \n   \n\\> I decided to follow a more traditionally typographic, less cursive form.   \n   \nRight. And my point is that to me it seems to have been at the expense of the \"dissimilitude\" that you claim. My impression is that this conservatism was the deciding factor, irrespective of dissimilitude, linguistics, etc.   \n   \nBut really, what I mind most isn't that you're conservative, it isn't that you claim \"dissimilitide\", and it isn't that you're saying it doesn't matter anyway - it's the confluence of all three! :-/   \n   \nBTW, I'm really not trying to discredit you in toto, I just want to point out what I see as the flaw in the aggregate opinion/action.   \n   \n\\> more words in the Biblical text end in resh than in dalet   \n   \nYes, this would be significant - and it would be quite a nice refinement - as well as an endorsement for linguistic analysis! Is the data available?   \n   \nAnd a question: So is it the opposite in general Hebrew text?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

However, modern Hebrew distinguishes tense in a regular way, and I don't how this is done or what impact it might have on word endings.   \n   \n   \nI don't rely on writing instruments to make any font. In the case of SBL Hebrew, _unusually_, I began the design process by making letters with a broadnib. This wasn't designing per se, this was research on how the steep ductus of Middle Eastern scripts affects the contrast pattern of individual letters in specific writing styles. As I explained during my ATypI presentation on the subject, I think it is important to understand a script within a cultural and historical context, and the best way to understand a script is to write it as it has been written. It happened, at the time, that I didn't have a broadnib pen with the properly angled nib, so I just used a typical broadbnib calligraphy pen. For the next time I want to write Hebrew or Arabic, I now have a set of properly cut reed pens.   \n   \nI'm troubled that you seem to have conflated this initial research and sketching with designing the typeface, and in some determinative way. As I've explained several times in the past, I design my types entirely onscreen. If I sketch on paper, with outlines, shading, a nib, or any other method, it is only to explore ideas about form. I suppose there might be someone out there who could actually produce the forms of SBL Hebrew, with their various non-chirographic adjustments of weight and terminal, with a broadnib pen. I couldn't.   \n   \n_Anyway, my point is that relying on a particular writing instrument to make a font is no less esoteric than worrying about readability._    \n   \nIndeed, and there is nothing wrong with esoterica, especially not in this business.
