He was an interesting guy who, late in his life, began doing very experimental and artistic work using a letterpress. This image was part of a periodical he published called the \\*Next Call.\\* He was killed by the Nazis when Allied forces invaded Holland.\n\nYou should look for more of his work, it’s really phenomenal.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n"
