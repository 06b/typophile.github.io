The said it was of roman style I searched the roman fonts and it it not there.  \nThis is a copy of the email  \nI already received your mail.  \nBut our fonts are Thai fonts.  \nAnd your sample is Roman characters.\n\nAlthough, we have Roman characters in our fonts, but not quite the same as your sample.  \nVery sorry for this.\n\n"

That information would have been helpful as they have published so many fonts over time.\n\nIf they say it's not one of theirs, that's the best that can be done. It may have been removed from their active inventory.\n\nI am very sorry for this too. Dick Pape\n\n"
