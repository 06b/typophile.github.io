They have a [photograph section](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121024836/http:/collectibles.listings.ebay.com/Photographic-Images_W0QQfromZR4QQsacatZ14277QQsocmdZListingItemListQQssPageNameZdcpCollectiblesTextNonFeat) with lots of original/one-of-a-kind photos. I just bought a bunch of photos from the 1800’s that I plan to use in some design/art work.\n\nCheck out the comtemporary section, but also the antique one since people seem to put photos from the 60’s and 70’s in this section as well.\n\n"

I like Eduardo’s work and have always come back to collage as a form. Here I’m interested in the subtle communication of the time we (Pam and I) are from—the convergence of the pre-digital with the contemporary. We are both a bit old school maybe.\n\nSo I’m just going to shoot this as I much prefer an SX-70 as a head.\n\nThanks all. Off to thrift!\n\n"
