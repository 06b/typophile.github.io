These characters are pretty unique looking. Perhaps someone knows a face that could be close.\n\nInitially I thought of Benguiat.

It was created by the staff of Dr. Ing. Rudolf Hell, the company that pioneered cathode ray phototypesetters.\n\n**1975 (first original ikarus face)**  \nMarconi Designed by Hermann Zapf for Hell, Marconi was the first original typeface to be produced with the Ikarus computer-aided design and digitization system. Ikarus, developed in 1973 by Peter Karow of URW (Unternehmensberatung Rubow Weber), was the dominant type design and production tool well into the 1990s.\n\n"

I’m personally not skilled enough with the pen tool to fathom doing something so delicate.\n\n"
