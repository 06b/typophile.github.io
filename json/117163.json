They replaced them with a different font, but decided they wanted to revert back to this one. However, nobody knows what font it is.  \nI’m having trouble finding a font that matches the “R” and the numbers.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nIn the second picture, it's the serif font, not the sans serif numbers on the right.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Church Sign](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724113826/http:/typophile.com/files/church%20sign%20-%20Copy.JPG) | 36.85 KB |\n| [church sign.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724113826/http:/typophile.com/files/church%20sign.JPG) | 333.58 KB |\n\n",
