Other features are the high N with a cross stroke that meets the rhs at midpoint and the R with very large bowel. Since this is a French movie you might consider Transat, [http://typophile.com/node/101182](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829170246/http:/typophile.com/node/101182 \"http://typophile.com/node/101182\"), a geometric sans serif typeface with the correct proportions for N and R. It has caps inspired by Art Deco signage — found inside the “Gare Maritime” ocean liner terminals at Le Havre and Cherbourg, in the early 1930s. Unfortunately Transat is too rounded. What would really help is as squared off version like [Berber](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829170246/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterbox/berber/) or Compacta.\n\nDon\n\n.\n\n"

Here is about the film, from the French Wikipedia;\n\n> Michel Serrault campe un inspecteur de police caractériel et imbu de son pouvoir pour qui il n'y a pas d'innocent. Ancien de la Gestapo française du 93 rue Lauriston (la \"carelingue\") il se désole que la police ne puisse employer le supplice de la baignoire.\n\nGoogle translation misses a negation; that former French Gestapo member is sorry the police may not use waterboarding.\n\n"
