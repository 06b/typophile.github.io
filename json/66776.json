I once had an interior design (almost) rejected because the art director, who was doing the jacket, didn't have the fonts I was proposing for the text. She felt strongly about maintaining the look of the interior. Others feel the function of a jacket is like a poster.\n\nNot an argument you can win, whichever side you pick.\n\nIf it is your choice, the jacket (cover for a paperback) design may well be affected by how the book is to be sold. From a catalog with little thumbnail images, surrounded by lots of whitespace & a good written description of the text? On a rack in a bookstore, where it has to compete with all the other covers for attention? Etc.\n\n"

      "content": "I think that it partly depends upon the nature of the book and its niche or category. Fine books tend to want to be more traditionally harmonious from outside to inside. General trade and mass-market, not so much.\n\nAs a designer, I started out idealistic about covers and interiors. When I became creative director at a publisher, I had to learn to adopt a more pragmatic approach. As has been mentioned, very often the interior and the cover end up being handled by different designers.\n\nI think that going into it with a requirement that cover and interior typography be the same is an unnecessary (and perhaps ill-advised) constraint. The two situations frequently have different needs and demands. Today’s book cover is mostly advertising/poster. The cover must entice; the interior must communicate.\n\nSometimes the same type palette can serve both needs. Often not.\n\nEmerson’s oft-quoted quip from _Self-Reliance_ comes to mind: “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”\n\nSince the two aspects were handled by different teams, I always took it as my job as creative director to make sure that the elements would come together and harmonize in the end — from directing the initial concepts to working with transition elements (like title page or back cover) to make sure that the overall object felt like it made perfect sense in the end.\n\n"

But it is no mistake to strive for an approximation between the typography of the jacket and that of the book. The jacket is first and foremost a small poster, an eye-catcher, where much is allowed that would be unseemly within the pages of the book itself. It is a pity that the cover, the true garb of a book, is so frequently neglected in favor of today’s multicolor jacket. Perhaps for this reason many people have fallen into the bad habit of placing books on the shelf while still in their jackets. I could understand this if the cover were poorly designed or even repulsive. But as a rule, book jackets belong in the waste paper basket, like empty cigarette packages.\"\n\n"

I used to work on trade covers and it was like a little death each time I opened my book and the interior was completely off. OTOH, the cover can change a zillion times and if the interior is on a deadline sometimes it can't wait for the marketing geniuses to make up their minds.\n\nI once did an interior for a cookbook. They sent me the cover for reference but said it didn't have to match. The cover was HIDEOUS. Then (because I had suggested it) they decided I should match the cover fonts, which by that time had changed, still awful. So I incorporated their fonts, reluctantly, and then when I got the book the cover had gone back to the ugly original, I had done an equally ugly interior, and they didn't work at all together.\n\nOh and yes, the relationship is the same if it's a paperback. On a HC, the cover, or case, should match the jacket.\n\n"

They are usually completely disconnected from each other. It often looks like someone grabbed an interior and folded some random cover around it. The design nearly always fails this way. As I mentioned earlier, the cover doesn't necessarily need the same typefaces, but I usually try to apply similar type, color and grid treatments as applied in the interior, so you really pull both of them together.\n\nLuckily I have been working for a publisher that is small to medium in size, so I do not have to deal with marketing departments.
