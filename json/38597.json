  "content": "FF CST was originally called FF City Street Type, but after this naming had been challenged by Berthold Types, the owners of the City trademark, it was agreed that the publisher, FontShop International, would refrain from using the full name. The type family by Berlin designers Ole Schäfer and Verena Gerlach is based on the two very distinct alphabets used in former East and West Berlin.\n\n",
