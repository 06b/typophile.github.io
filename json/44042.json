      "content": "John, this is some lovely swash action. It reads for me. I’d suggest not using the white hairlines to define edges. I like the beginning EIG more because of it. The backside of the cross-stroke on T seems a little thin, maybe should be closer to the front side of the cross-stroke on the H? The tail on the r seems a little horsey and the finial too sharp. You have a (sort of ) ball terminal on the cross-stroke on the EIG, but then you use sharp on the second E and the R and O. Not that combining both is bad, but maybe you need to decide how and where those are used a little bit more?\n\n"
