I am sure you are having in your mind to go on with your letterforms and create a complete font anyway.   \n   \nWhen i saw the nice symbol you created i thought that by condensing the upper dot a little you could have an compact exclamation mark which is suitable to the case (ideas in a protective nest).   \nBut tell me about the company. A long time ago I watched on tv a documentary about Barcelona and there was a German guy who created such a company. Is it the same you are working for? I am curious. It is funny because i was impressed by the idea and it's the only thing i remember from the documentary. It will be a nice coincidence to be the same company.   \n   \nBuenos dias, christos\n\n"
