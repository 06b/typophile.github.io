UPPERCASE gallery owner, Janine Vangool, and photographer Kirstie Tweed (Orange Girl Photographs) will curate from these images to create a physical exhibition and companion book. The exhibition will be part of Exposure, the Banff-Calgary Month of Photography (February 2008).\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/groups/typeblock/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090413172614/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/typeblock/ \"http://www.flickr.com/groups/typeblock/\")  \n [http://www.uppercasegallery.ca](http://web.archive.org/web/20090413172614/http:/www.uppercasegallery.ca/ \"http://www.uppercasegallery.ca\")\n\n",

So, er, Welcome!\n\nYes, “text” is slippery, but in the art world “text art” or “text-based art” refer to work with lettering or type as the main visual element.\n\nI don’t know what the best solution is. It just seemed strange that an exhibition of what will probably comprise predominantly photos of hand-made, one-off lettering is being described as typography.\n\n"

Lettering as an umbrella term could include:  \nCalligraphy (defined as “beautiful writing)  \npenmanship  \nhandwriting  \nsignpainting  \nlettercarving  \nbrush lettering\n\nbut not type, or typography. Typography involves type; see above. Type is modular, lettering is handmade; one of a kind. You can reproduce lettering (screenprinted shirts, hotel logos), but it’s still lettering, not typography. Type can be used with lettering, and both involve the alphabet and writing, but they still are not the same. It’s like the difference between studio pottery and production ware, or custom/retail, or couture/rack. Handmade versus mechanical. Type gets designed by hand (sometimes), but then becomes mechanical when it’s made into type.\n\nI do think the distinction is meaningful and important for designers to acknowledge; hand skills are dying out, and people are becoming oblivious to the way things get made. Everything is not photoshop, assemblage, appropriation and “homage”. Some people create things directly with their hands.\n\n"

The notion of documenting a city block was to make this a specific activity: take your camera into your immediate surroundings and see what you can find. Even in seemingly the most mundane surroundings, if you look, you can find the beauty. Garbage in the street, a bus token floating in a puddle, an emotional handmade plea to find a lost pet... or perhaps you find a stately plaque on a historical building, decaying hand-painted shop signs or beautifully designed modern signage. Each person’s “type block” will be different.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\*\n\n"

It was supposed to be a small, volunteer local project that Calgary Typos would do for fun. It’s now your own personal commercial project (and that you bragged about making money with at the last meeting), posted in public in an international forum, and there is no stated remuneration for people who submit photographs. (There is remuneration for anyone who wins the contest, right?)\n\nGosh, I can’t think of any reason that I (or the other members who thought this was a volunteer project to promote type in Calgary) would be disapponted or confused.\n\nSilly moi.\n\n"

Maybe I don’t have a thick enough skin for forums.\n\nSince a large portion of this thread has been about vocabulary, I will state that I take offense to the juvenile comments of referring to people as “snottier-than-thou” and references to people being “anti-social”. I am trying to produce a professional project here. If you want to discuss the Type Block project, that’s fine. If you want to name-call and insult, start your own thread. Almost anyone reading this thread would likely agree with me.\n\nI did not “brag about making money”, Linda. What a rude thing to post for all to see. If you can figure out how to make money with this project, let me know, it would certainly be most welcome to hear.\n\nThis project is not a contest. There is no fee for people to participate. People choose to join or not and our intentions are clearly stated on the Flickr group. My gallery will cover the cost of printing and displaying the chosen images. The exhibition is part of a Banff-Calgary photography festival that is free to the public during the month of February. We haven’t decided if the works will be for sale, and if they are, the prices will be determined by the artist with a small portion going to the gallery to recoup the printing and display costs.\n\nThe publication is a way of commemorating the project and will be a book published via Blurb or another print-on-demand source. Participants and the general public who are interested can order the book online and we’ll have a few in the gallery that month. That’s it. This definitely falls into the “labour of love” category.\n\nSo if you share a love for this project, we’d love to have you onboard and I’ll see you on Flickr. It’s a much friendlier place.\n\n"
