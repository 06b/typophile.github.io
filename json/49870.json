If you could tell me if these numbers or numbers like these can be found in any font, I'd appreciate it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317141036im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0502_5792.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317141036im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_0503_6414.JPG)\n\nSorry that I can't get an image that's not blurry.\n\n",
