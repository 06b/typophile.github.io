      "content": "[From](http://web.archive.org/) [Linotype's web site](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417161232/http:/www.linotype.com/1537/Times-family.html):\n\n> In 1931, The Times of London commissioned a new text type design from Stanley Morison and the Monotype Corporation, after Morison had written an article criticizing The Times for being badly printed and typographically behind the times. The new design was supervised by Stanley Morison and drawn by Victor Lardent, an artist from the advertising department of The Times. Morison used an older typeface, Plantin, as the basis for his design, but made revisions for legibility and economy of space (always important concerns for newspapers). As the old type used by the newspaper had been called Times Old Roman,\" Morison's revision became \"Times New Roman.\" The Times of London debuted the new typeface in October 1932, and after one year the design was released for commercial sale. The Linotype version, called simply \"Times,\" was optimized for line-casting technology, though the differences in the basic design are subtle. The typeface was very successful for the Times of London, which used a higher grade of newsprint than most newspapers. The better, whiter paper enhanced the new typeface's high degree of contrast and sharp serifs, and created a sparkling, modern look. In 1972, Walter Tracy designed Times Europa for The Times of London. This was a sturdier version, and it was needed to hold up to the newest demands of newspaper printing: faster presses and cheaper paper. In the United States, the Times font family has enjoyed popularity as a magazine and book type since the 1940s. Times continues to be very popular around the world because of its versatility and readability. And because it is a standard font on most computers and digital printers, it has become universally familiar as the office workhorse. Times™, Times™ Europa, and Times New Roman™ are sure bets for proposals, annual reports, office correspondence, magazines, and newspapers.\n> \n> Linotype offers many versions of this font:  \n> **Times™** is the universal version of Times, used formerly as the matrices for the Linotype hot metal line-casting machines. The basic four weights of roman, italic, bold and bold italic are standard fonts on most printers. There are also small caps, Old style Figures, phonetic characters, and Central European characters.  \n> **Times™ Ten** is the version specially designed for smaller text (12 point and below); its characters are wider and the hairlines are a little stronger. Times Ten has many weights for Latin typography, as well as several weights for Central European, Cyrillic, and Greek typesetting.  \n> **Times™ Eighteen** is the headline version, ideal for point sizes of 18 and larger. The characters are subtly condensed and the hairlines are finer.  \n> **Times™ Europa** is the Walter Tracy re-design of 1972, its sturdier characters and open counterspaces maintain readability in rougher printing conditions.  \n> **Times New Roman™** is the historic font version first drawn by Victor Lardent and Stanley Morison for the Monotype hot metal caster.\n\nYou have not specified the origin for the versions you have, which would be key to identifying whether they are commercial retail versions or OEM operating system versions.\n\n"

      "content": "One difference - I'm not saying it's significant - that lets people quickly identify whether a font is based on Linotype Times Roman or Monotype Times (New) Roman - is the shape of the lowercase z in italics. The Monotype version has a simple sloped z; the Linotype version has a swash on the bottom stroke.\n\nAny other differences (Linotype vs. Monotype, as opposed to Times versus Times Ten) are generally too subtle for the layperson and not particularly significant. Times Ten, on the other hand, is based on the 10 point size of Times, and so genuinely addresses a common flaw in digital adaptations of metal type - they're used to set text, but they're based on large sizes of the metal face, not text sizes, because they're easier to trace from.\n\nThe history is that Monotype invented Times Roman; Linotype licensed it, and copied it just about as closely as they could, and then Monotype had to use a slightly different name in the U.S. to avoid a trademark conflict.\n\nOh, yes, I almost forgot - and Linotype machines had a very serious limitation, in that the regular and italic forms (and usually the bold as well) of a face had to have the same widths for every letter. This meant, for _many_ Linotype typefaces, that the italic was wider than it should be.\n\n"

I think that Burgess did design a face, and it did look a lot like Times Roman, and so Mike Parker acted in good faith.\n\nHowever, I think he was still _wrong_.\n\nBasically, I think the original face by Burgess derived from De Vinne, while Times Roman derived from Plantin, and the similarity between them was coincidental (to the extent that it exceeded the similarity to be expected from having Caslon and Dutch types among their models and influences).\n\n@riccard0:  \nActually, this doesn't have anything much to do with the difference between \"typeface\" and \"font\" in the usual sense, but rather with the difference between \"typeface\" and something else, which is sometimes taken as another meaning of the word \"font\".\n\nThat is, the thing we want people to use the word \"font\" for is one of the following:  \n- a package of lead type slugs for printing in a given typeface, perhaps containing 20 a's and proportional numbers of the rest of the letters in the alphabet;  \n- a file with the extension .ttf or .otf used to allow a computer to print in a given typeface;  \n- an element for a Selectric composer, the brass matrices to fill a Monotype matrix-case, or the round or square negative to put in a photocomposition machine.\n\nThe alternate meaning of font, for which we really need a _third_ word, is a specific weight, size, and drawing of a given typeface. It's the \"sometimes subtle difference between _typeface_ and\" _that_ which Times Roman in this discussion would help to explain.\n\nAnd it doesn't help that this third thing is much closer to being like a typeface (as it is an abstract way of shaping letters too, just a more specific one) than it is to be a font. So as long as you call the third thing a font, you end up increasing confusion rather than decreasing it.\n\n"

Otherwise, we’ll need a new term also for files used to produce vector-based letters, because they’re not size-specific, like a lead font is.  \nSo, given there will always be philosophical and semantical nuances, I think the best way to discriminate is to referring to the “thing”, the œuvre, the platonic idea, as _typeface_, and as _font_ to the technical mean needed to deliver it.\n\n"
