  "content": "For Immediate Release:  \nBuffalo, NY- January 5th, 2010\n\nP22 Type Foundry and the International House of Fonts ring in the New Year with P22 Nudgewink Pro- a new font designed by Robby Woodard for IHOF.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140811062321im_/http:/typophile.com/files/NudgewinkPoster_4616.png)\n\nNudgewink is a funky, all caps typeface with a humorous retro 1960s attitude and a very bouncy baseline in three weights- regular, light and bold. The lower case contains a second set of differently designed caps that can be used in combination with the upper case to achieve different effects.\n\nPro OpenType features include discretionary ligatures, alternates and ornaments.\n\nWith all the different options, a dynamic handcrafted effect can be achieved with just a little experimentation. So load it up, turn it on and go for it, Dude! Hip and groovy uses include signage, invitations and greeting card design.\n\n-------------------------------------------------  \nIntroductory offer through January 31st  \n [http://www.p22.com/ihof/nudgewink.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140811062321/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/nudgewink.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/nudgewink.html\")  \n-------------------------------------------------  \nView P22 Nudgewink Pro in action in our newsletter:  \n [http://p22.com/newsletter/01\\_05\\_10.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140811062321/http:/p22.com/newsletter/01_05_10.html \"http://p22.com/newsletter/01\\_05\\_10.html\")  \n-------------------------------------------------  \nYou can now follow P22 on Twitter.com: [http://www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20140811062321/http:/www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry \"http://www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry\")  \n------------------------------------------------  \nBecome a fan of P22 on Facebook:  \n [http://www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951](http://web.archive.org/web/20140811062321/http:/www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951 \"http://www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951\")  \n------------------------------------------------  \nHappy New Years!  \nP22 type foundry\n\n",
