  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'd like to install python 2.3 on my Mac OS X v10.5. But i cannot find any fitting version of it, am blind/stupid or it really doesn't exist?\n\nI guess the python 2.3 version for v10.3 isn't the right one for me, right?  \nAnd only the MacPython 2.3 works with FontLab, right?\n\nCould anybody help me, please!?\n\nThanks,  \n;\\>\n\n",

It seemed to iron out a lot of kinks on my 10.6 machine to do with font development. Good luck!\n\n"
