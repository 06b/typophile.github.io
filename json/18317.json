I have individual ttfs for all the different “versions” of the font, MrsEaves (MrsEavesRoman, MrsEavesItalic, MrsEavesAllSmallCaps, MrsEavesSmallCaps and MrsEavesPetiteCaps) MrsEavesSmallCaps, MrsEavesPetiteCaps and MrsEavesRoman take on the identity of MrsEavesItalic when previewed. Any idea why the other 2 would work fine but those 3 do not? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n [‹ HOW TO MANAGE HINTINGS CORRECTLY](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109060817/http:/typophile.com/node/18310 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fontlab: Clean Up Classes command ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109060817/http:/typophile.com/node/18334 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
