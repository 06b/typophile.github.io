Too bad you can’t see previews of the different fonts on that page.\n\nAlso, you might want to browse through the sci-fi section at [DaFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20060604052119/http:/www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=303&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=DIFFERENT+STROKES&nb_ppp=10&classt=alpha) for similar techno-ish fonts.\n\n"

It goes by the name there of, simply, Digital. No promise of equal quality, though.\n\n"
