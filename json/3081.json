  "content": "Hello,   \nAs a font user, rather than a font creator, I'm not really familiar with font file technicalities.   \n   \nWhat I need to know is what is the easiest way to change a font name, in a true type font file.   \n(The software I'm using embeds the font into an executable file, but if a font of the same name is on the user's system, then it uses that instead. This is causing me real problems, as some of the target audience have a different font file, with the same font name, and the text is all wrong on their screens).   \nI need to change the name of the font - jst prefix it with a number and an underscore or something - while the program compiles.   \n   \nThanks   \nS\n\n",
