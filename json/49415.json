  "content": "Hi. I'm Diego Sanz Salas. I'm 24 years old peruvian designer. My first font is Sencilla. I'm working it at fontstruct.fontshop.com . You can download it at [http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/4701](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106075109/http:/fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/4701) . Now it has 1254 characters for Latin Extended, Greek Polytonic, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew and Arabic. I'm working now on Thai. I want to fix all the mistakes you could found. Please leave your commentaries here [http://typophile.com/node/49355](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106075109/http:/typophile.com/node/49355) or in the fonstruct site.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106075109im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sencilla_6726.gif)\n\n",
