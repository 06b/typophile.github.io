  "content": "Hello,   \nI'm doing here and there (mostly by chance) a reseacrh of certain contemporary typefaces in use (almost all from the boom years of Emigre, the first middle of the 1990s).   \nWhat intrigued me most was the use of a specific face (Jon Barnbrook Ma(n)son) in a widespread way but also unexpected situations:   \nfrom the latest Barbie cartoons DVD to the novel \"I, Lucifer\", to religious theatrical pieces posters; from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to a big (and embarassingly banal) Italian shopping center logotype.   \n   \nI would really love if you could drop me a line (and possibly the URL) when you see Manson used in unexpected (or even expected but good) ways.   \n   \nOther typefaces with a conceptual background (which users cannot guess from the face itself) I'm interested in seeing and collecting samples of their use are:   \n   \nTemplate Gothic (Emigre)   \nKeedy Sans (Emigre)   \nExocet (Emigre)   \nDemocratica (Emigre)   \nProzac (Virus)   \nAuferstehung (Linotype)   \nCircumcision/CQN Molecular (T-26)   \nMerlin (FontFont)   \nOneleigh (FontFont)   \n   \nMost of these may be seen by many people as \"novelty faces\" but part of them have been and are undoubtedly faces reflecting our times and the relationship with the emerging computer technology from the late 1980s early 1990s.   \nIn different ways, of course.   \nOneleigh (and Merlin), for example, I would be really interested to know if someone have used them in books or textsetting.   \n   \nPlease, report freely also examples of any other face (expecially conceptual) used in an original or surprising way.   \n   \nThank you SO much!\n\n",

Here in Italy we've had nice use of these faces but some of them I saw when I wasn't collecting samples yet.   \nCould you tell me more about this book? It's not so clear from the cover: the man seems a friendly blend between St. Joseph and Santa Claus but I guess it's just a good christmas story.   \nIn case, could you send me a higher resolution scan in jpg? It seems enough interesting and unusual to fit in my project idea...   \n   \nI wonder why people feel always the urge to enlarge Democratica's initial letters when the face is meant to be unicase. Anyway, this comes most from amateurs, while in your sample the enlargement is moderate and works quite nice.\n\n"

(488 gsm)cover paper, each printed on one   \nside with a glossy finish, and then stuck together. this particular   \nbook is about 5.25 by 5.75 inches and is 0.75 inches thick, yet has   \nonly 28 pages, including the covers. the point is the pages are very thick,   \nmade so chubby little baby hands can easily grab the pages and turn them.   \nthe book is about a man who builds a village to protect all of his   \nchildren from the dangerous forest surrounding them. one of the kids   \nfinds a whole in the outer wall of the village and crawls through,   \ngets lost, etc. the man comes and saves him, etc. it's obviously an allegory   \nfor the choices we make and how god will help us and all of that stuff.   \nemail me and let me know where i should send the high res images. btw, i   \nthink the designer should have left the title unicase instaed of faking   \nthe caps. it's just weird seeing it like that.\n\n"

Barrow) talks about the limitations of scientific thought (and of man's \"God complex\" in general), and this is echoed masterfully by the use of Template Gothic, designed by Barry in a deliberately \"irregular\" way to underline the imperfection and irregularity (and thus the limits) of this life.\n\n"

I did not imagine they have used Manson in other products beside the Barbie DVD (and I wasn't even sure they did outside Italy). Here Rapunzel translates as Raperonzolo, which is one of the most ridiculous names you can find in Italian. I guessed the original german name would have been something like that. After all it's from an old fairy tale. Barbie just plays the role of the Princess.   \n   \nPlease do send the hi-res scan. The size you've used here it's just fine: make it 300ppi and it would be A-OK. In fact I mean to showcase the DVD cover in big size.   \nThis is because in it the \"dreamy\" and \"fairytalish\" atmosphere is so strong contrasting with Manson in an incredible way.
