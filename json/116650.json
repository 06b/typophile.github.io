  "content": "Hi, I have a client who uses Centaur (Regular - I think) for their logo. On their website it looks a little blurred around some edges and is not totally crisp.\n\nI assumed I could just get the vector version of the original logo and re-save it but I noticed even in Adobe Illustrator it still looks slightly blurred around some edges - until i magnified it 12 times. Some of the angles are just so fine that it seems they don't come out so well on screen.\n\nSo my question is this - is this font not ideal for screen display and if so can anyone recommend a very similar alternative that is good for screens?\n\n",
