  "content": "Hello typophiles,\n\nThis is my first post in the critique section. I recently made this logo for an Artificial Intelligence symposium at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. I'm pleased with it, it portrays the \"motion\" aspect well I think. Please tell me what you think.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [aimotion.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108201938/http:/typophile.com/files/aimotion.png) | 10.22 KB |\n\n",
