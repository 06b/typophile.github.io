  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am really very new in Typeface design and need your help and suggestions in use of various softwares. I have designed few fonts using Illustrator and they are in illustrator pdf or eps format. Now I want to digitalize them and convert them to Opentype or Truetype or Potscript type format. How to go about it from the files I have? I have Fontlab, Corel Draw, Adobe softwares. Can these files be directly imported to any of these softwares and then convert them to one of the Type formats?\n\nI will really appreciate your help and suggestions. I have never used Fontlab studio before and I was trying to open these files but it didn't open in Fontlab and I couldn't find any Import option as well.\n\nThanks in advance,  \nTypomaniac.\n\n",
