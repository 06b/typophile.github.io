I am hoping that someone has already made this so I don't have to do it myself!\n\nIt seems like the Hebrew script would be this quite well, not just because it shares the fact that there are no capital letters. Do you know that font that is over all of the Irish pubs across the world? That is what I am thinking (with the option to add in dots or flourishes).\n\nSomething like ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317094020im_/http:/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Gaelic-text-Duibhlinn.png)\n\nI'm not referring to the 'sword' typeface used in The Hobbit movie. The closest thing I found was on someone's engraving service. ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317094020im_/http:/www.cjstones.com/prod_images/lettering/HebrewScript.jpg)\n\n",
