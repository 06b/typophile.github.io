      "content": "I don't think there currently is any really good way to do what you are describing. Most tools that claim to do this tend to have reliability issues. The reason is that in order for the samples to be generated, all of the fonts have to be turned on. In most cases, people who are using this sort of tool have more fonts than can pracitally turned on at once. So, to really work well, the tool would have to turn fonts off and on as it went through the collection. If there are any bad fonts, the application would have to be able to handle it.  \nThe same problem exists with WYSIWYG font menus, but to a lesser degree.\n\nPersonally, I've used an Applescript that generates an InDesign file from active fonts. You can get it here if you're interested.  \n [http://www.portlandtype.com/news/?p=54](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018214155/http:/www.portlandtype.com/news/?p=54 \"http://www.portlandtype.com/news/?p=54\")\n\n"
