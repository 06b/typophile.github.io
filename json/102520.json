  "content": "I recently purchased an Adobe font – Myriad Hebrew Bold – to use on a client's job. I can't read or write Hebrew but I usually can just copy and paste letters into InDesign based on a sample sent by the client. On my Mac I can use Quick Look to see a preview of the font and Suitcase, my font management system, also has a preview. Myriad Hebrew Bold (which is definitely Hebrew on the Adobe site) appears as an English font on my system, in both previews and when used in any program. After hours being transferred around on Adobe Customer Service, the final verdict was that I needed a special non-English keyboard or something to use the font! I have dozens of other foreign language fonts that work perfectly. Does anyone have any idea what's going on? Could this really be a font that can only be used in a Hebrew language system environment? There's certainly no reference to that on the Adobe site. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

I can painfully proof for the right characters, but when you add the marks & software control of their placement... better to have familiarity with the language. Or so we feel.

I usually open one of my Hebrew fonts and then visually copy the letters I see one by one in the into my document. It's an illiterates way of writing, but it works for a word or two.

We did force different linebreaks in the Hebrew sentences by adding junk Latin characters at the head of a test paragraph, and it rebroke the lines with Hebrew correctly, but that's not the same thing.\n\nFor the original poster -- If it is two works, I'd just set the Hebrew any way you can. I've set 20 pages of it that way from manuscript -- with cantellation marks put in by hand to mirror the manuscript. I told the client what it would cost ahead of time, and held the charges to that (a very large amount).\n\nThis was before OpenType, by the way. OpenType offers great time savings, but you then have to trust the software, as there often isn't a \\*manuscript\\* -- just a computer file in MS Word. And you know what that can be worth...\n\nEdit:\n\nBTW, I believe John Hudson did Adobe Hebrew (essentially a Minion-based font). Believe Myriad was done by Slimbach...\n\n"

This is because some businesses there have noticed poor tipping and a result add the gratuity for those who are used to the gratuity being integrated in the bill.
