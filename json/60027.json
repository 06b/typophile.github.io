Although you can change the width of the character panel now, with some experimentation I still can't make the new width \"stick\". As soon as I drag ways the attached panel it snaps back to default width.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you can always try resetting the program preferences.\n\n"

When I add another panel underneath with resize grip it only lets me make it bigger!  \nIt was a French corporate magazine that did it, they had really long character style names.

Attach a panel that can be resized (e.g. Table Styles) below the Character panel  \n3. Use the grip above the Character panel (see highlighted in red in the image below) to change the width of the column of panels\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022033438im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IDCS3_panels_6642.png)\n\n"

If you look at my image the lines that separate each section of the character window extend to the current edge of the window (they don't go any further, I can make the window larger because there is no lines but I can't make it smaller as the lines seem to block it)\n\nThanks again but I'll probably have to just live with it until i upgrade.\n\n"
