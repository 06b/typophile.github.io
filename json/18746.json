Now, whatever the merits of that idea, I approached the task of designing a monowidth typeface for it strictly on the premise of improving text colour, because monowidth fonts produce very lumpy colour. It occurred to me that combining monowidth with the Alphabet 26 unicase scheme would be one way to do that.\n\nIt's not a question of unicase looking \"wacky\", but a question of how it's used. Sure, an unusual font will look wacky if it's dropped into a generic tombstone layout. But the point of creative typographic design, going beyond easy rote cliches, is to create a concept and execution (layout, typography, illustration, etc.) where everything works together as a seamless, synergistic whole, and no component stands out above the overall message. So, find the layout that fits the face, or vice versa.\n\n"
