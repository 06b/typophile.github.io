  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nI am currently working on a Kinetic Typography project. I have to animate the lyrics of a song. The one I chose was ... Rob Zombie - Two Lane Blacktop, because I recently watched the movie by the same name.\n\nIf you've heard the song, you would know that, it is a very \"in your face\" track. I wanted to ask what kind of a typeface would go with it? ... I don't want to use \"decorative fonts\", and when I use Helvetica, DIN, Avant Garde, Rockwell etc. they seem to be very neutral, or just inappropriate.\n\nHere's the kind of stuff I've done earlier this year:  \n [http://www.vimeo.com/user2388063](http://web.archive.org/web/20120301020847/http:/www.vimeo.com/user2388063 \"http://www.vimeo.com/user2388063\")\n\nThanks,  \nSumit\n\n",
