The font is custom made for Swedbank (exclusive rights) and are available in four weights; Regular, Medium, Bold and Extra Bold.</cite>\n\n"

It's something I actually enjoy quite a bit especially if it's for specific conditions so the font will perform better. So no, I never refused to change Klavika. As I said, I was never contacted in the first place. (to be fair, Stefan mentions this was a 'nasty rumor')\n\nI was however contacted by a distributor in Sweden in the summer of '06 inquiring into the possibility of a unlimited global license of Klavika for a financial client. To make a long story short, they didn't like our price and we never heard from them again. Swedbank to date has license for 8 CPUs of Klavika.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nI can only speculate beyond this, so if I learn more, I'll chime in.\n\nthanks again\n\n"
