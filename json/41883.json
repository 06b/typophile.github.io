I've used the same oval-shaped brush at 45 degrees on everything but the cross on the A, which I've noticed many fonts make thin. I studied the history of each letter before deciding on the design, primarily using wikipedia, to make sure I put the curves in the places they should be from a historical standpoint.  \nI may make this in to a serif font, and I may relegate a few to italics, depending on how the full set looks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012080419im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font%20sample%20one_4590.jpg)\n\nOh yeah, I left the guidelines in so you could see what I'm doing on each letter.\n\nI'm not sure what else should go in this post, as I'm new, so advice on board etiquette would also be appreciated.\n\n",

Other than that, I'd need to see more letters to really give feedback.\n\nIf you're using Gimp on Linux, check out [fontforge](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012080419/http:/typophile.com/wiki/fontforge) ( [http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012080419/http:/fontforge.sourceforge.net/ \"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\")) -- it's a free font creation tool, and you can construct your glyphs the same way -- with a guideline and a brush.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks.  \nI'm trying to keep the thing roughly monospaced, in that the letters will be roughly half as wide as the height of the line (hence the lower case circles), so I was actually thinking of reworking the A so the right leg was on a steeper angle, thereby making it thinner, but, as you said, it looks really nice as is. Which upper cases look best with the lower cases?\n\nI'm a little stuck on e. Would you recommend a circle with a section taken out and a line added, or a circle with a transfer to a wide ellipse (like how the a has a transfer from ellipse to circle back to ellipse to blunt the end and the d does a backwards transfer to the ascender [if that's unclear, I'm basically just using the fact that curves are parallel where they meet to switch from one path to another]), pulling out to a horizontal line at the bottom of the ellipse (like how I went from circle to vertical on the b), or something else entirely? (yes, I user \"or\" thrice, but would you have understood what I was saying otherwise?)\n\n"
