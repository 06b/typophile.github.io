Announcing the most comprehensive typographic solution for professional design – Linotype’s four new OpenType collections. Available separately or together as a bundle, Linotype’s four new OpenType collections make it easy to custom build your own font library. Joining the headline stories in this issue is a spotlight on “Gothic” fonts. Industrial-era sans serif fonts from the United States, these “Gothics” are anything but scary and medieval! In contrast to these workhorses, we’d like to present our favorite font for April, Linotype Notec. This low-tech script returns type to its hand-written roots. Our last bit of news this month is a new feature we’ve brought to font family pages on our website. Now these pages include real-life samples of their typefaces in use. Roll over the images and get inspired by our typographic treats!\n\n[Read the rest of the Linoletter at Linotype.com!](http://web.archive.org/web/20060506041906/http:/www.linotype.com/8-38-8-19491/issue200604.html)\n\nOr, [subscribe to the Linoletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20060506041906/http:/www.linotype.com/webshop/newsletter.php), and get the information delivered every month directly to your mailbox.\n\n",
