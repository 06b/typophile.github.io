The status of this letter is not well described.   \n   \nI'd like to add that the main reason I see why it is not much used, is because most type writers (and most computer keyboards) do not support it or through a difficult key sequence. Neither the upper case nor the lower case character is present in iso-8859-1, the character set we're supposed to be happy with in the Netherlands :-)   \n   \nMost people simply type ij, but this poses a problem in sorting.\n\n"
