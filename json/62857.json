  "content": "A while ago i started a small personal project where i try to bring the canon of graphic design together, linking them, so history would be a little clearer for me than the brief lessons i had at school. I only managed to add a few, and mostly dutch designers, as this is where focus was on my (belgian) school.  \nI’ve got a list of over 50 designers i want to learn more about and add, but i noticed there’s some gaps in this list. Names mainly come from the Netherlands, Switzerland, USA and the constructivists in Hungaria and Russia.  \nI’d love to find out about the canon in Italy, Spain, UK, France, Germany, and beyond Europe and the USA. Could you throw some names?\n\nYou can find the current short list on [http://www.iconofgraphics.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20091026193740/http:/www.iconofgraphics.com/ \"http://www.iconofgraphics.com\")\n\nthanks for your help.  \nJoke\n\n",
