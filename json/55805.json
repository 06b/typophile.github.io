It allows you to reorder lookups, but this indeed is done by changing the order of feature entries with which the lookups are associated with. But it is important to remember that by reordering the feature definitions in FontLab Studio's OpenType panel, you're actually reordering lookups.\n\nI think what John means is that by following the simplistic notion introduced by Adobe FDK for OpenType 1.x that each lookup is defined within a feature definition, the flexibility in which you can order your lookups is limited. Fortunately, by my feature request Adobe implemented the ability to define lookups outside of feature definitions in the Adobe FDK for OpenType 2.x syntax, which will be used in FontLab Studio 6 (no release date yet).\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

Old-timers may understand very well when one uses \"mental shortcuts\" or \"abbreviations\", but since this is a public forum with the idea of serving not only 1-to-1 communication but also allowing others to learn from what is being discussed here.\n\nAnd realizing that Typophile has users from all over the world, for many of whom English may be the third language (like in my case) or perhaps second at best, I prefer to stay on the safe side when communicating, i.e. avoid confusion and misunderstandings.\n\n\\> you won’t see me add a “Studio” each time I talk of FontLab\n\nSure thing, you can call it whatever you want, \"the rusty old thing\", \"the Russian pest\", \"лаборатория шрифтов\" or \"it\". Some people will get it, others won't. One can never guarantee that there will be no misunderstanding but one can minimize its probability :)\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"

It is essentially a syntax and UI issue. But it is interesting how is confuses people as to how OT actually works. I recently had an email from someone with a lot of experience making OT fonts in FontLab, ahem, Studio, who was shifting to VOLT for a particular project that needed GPOS mark positioning. He was very confused by the VOLT UI, because he couldn't figure out how to re-order the features. :)\n\n"

It's just like the one glyph-one glyph name-one Unicode thinking. Once you introduce the notion that some or all glyphs may not have names at all, and that some glyphs may be associated with none or with many Unicode codepoints, or may represent a sequence of Unicode codepoints, people's minds starts to drift off :)\n\nWe're working on the ideas for a FLS6 UI for OpenType Layout.\n\nA.\n\n"
