  "content": "In Praise of an Ap which I Loathe, MS Word I love you!\n\nIn the early days of MSWord, I used to love its tiny size and ease of use—after all, it fit on a 400k floppy disk along with my System folder with Excel and MacDraw! In recent years, it has become so bloated and sluggish that I can’t stand the thought of launching it and waiting forever for the behemoth to finally load (that little “help” paperclip thing needs to be shot too). I have come to use a tiny little text editor for almost all my word-processing. It is fast, clean, and totally bug free!  \nNow for the other shoe—  \nA couple of years ago, I started designing typefaces and began using FontLab. The current version has a nice little feature under the “Quick Test as OTF” menu which allows you to get a text dump of all the glyphs in the font you are working on. What a great way to test fonts! The catch is, things like smallcaps cogonek show up as “Undefined” squares when I paste the text into my trusty text editor or even into InD. Even changing the font to something all encompassing like Garamond Premier Pro won’t fix it! Damn!  \nHere Word Comes to Save the Day!  \nThe other day, I had accidentally opened the dreaded MSWord instead of my little text editor. I got a phone call then so I let the overgrown monster launch while I took the call. Since I had the thing open already, I just pasted the character set text from FontLab into the blank Word file. SHAZZZAAAAM!!! The whole thing pasted! Most of it as Lucida Grande but the smallcaps diacritics and supnums pasted as Big Caslon! Word chose a font from my system which recognized each glyph. If one font didn’t have a glyph, it switched to another on the fly! I then placed the Word file into InD and I was in business!!!  \nGod, it hurts me to say this but, MS Word I love you!\n\nChrisL\n\n [‹ Vegas show fonts anyone?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919140619/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30487 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Neon sign Gotham font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919140619/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30467 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
