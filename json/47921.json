And then there are irc channels, from where you can get freshest released fonts by groups, they are pure ones, no extracts from pdf's(as they buy those fonts, to give it for free to others.) And if you are deep into warez thing there are ftp's with basically everything on them - it is warez scheme for everithing, not only fonts.  \nSo, I don't think that anyone should care about extracts(from pdfs) as mostly fonts dont have all glyphs and all weights, and sadly there are nothing you can do about the real fonts out there(you can ask thou, to the uploader via mail or pm not to upload, they all are grown up ppl, and I think that most of them will listen to you).  \nAnd its not true that those fonts are corrupted, mostly they are pure files, as the community tend to clean the \"scene\" from bad fonts.  \nSo, why I know this all - because I live in Latvia :D Im glad, that I work at company that license fonts used in projects, but 80% of companies does not. But it is how it is, because life here sux.  \nAnd, at the end, I want to say, that piracy doesnt means that you loose money(it is speculatively and wrong to say that) as many ppl try fonts, and if they loves them, they buy license. As I wont buy 4 fonts, to just show them to client in real life, but I buy the one client chooses. Maybe its wrong, but I love typography and its not possible to license every font on my computer.  \nAnd I feel sorry that you need to see you work pirated, I Know how you feel!\n\n"

I'm saying that it's a rather futile endeavor to go after 'font collectors' who are swapping 1000s of fonts out there on the web. So, it can be a lot of effort for no real result.\n\nGo after commercial theft...design firms using illicit fonts for ad campaigns. Those are more likely real losses of sales.\n\nUltimately, if one is selling digital media, they need to realize that the technology allows for unlimited copying. That's just the way it is. So the business model needs to cater to that. What some are saying (including myself) is that it's probably best to cater to the professional, paying market.
