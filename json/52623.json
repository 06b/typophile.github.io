  "content": "Hi,  \nWondering if anybody has found software that lets you design a font specimen or sample sheet and then apply it automatically to many fonts to generate a sample book or printing/PDF.\n\nI've tried a few, the best I've found so far is FontCat. However it doesn't seem to be able to provide the ability to mix styles from one font on the same page, not to mention that on my mac at least it is unstable and crashes randomly.\n\nFor example the Univers font has many, many weights and widths. I don't want to print out a new sheet for each style of that family. I want to make a single page sample sheet that shows me what the five main weights/widths are like in different sizes.\n\nAny recommendations or advice on this subject would be appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\n",
