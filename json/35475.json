Slowly but surely making their way out of the Cave. ;)\n\nI really like the redesign. The only thing that could make it better in my opinion is the removal of the word \"classic\". But I'm quite happy as it is.\n\n"

It feels like they’re just trying to make the fake-retro trend work for them, but doing the job by committee.\n\n<cite>I wonder if Coke and Pepsi buyers really care about the constant rebranding or if it really impacts sales.</cite>\n\nI read an article a few years ago that said Coke does so much marketing it’s next to impossible for them to guage the success of most of their efforts, so they just keep shifting money around and changing their methods to keep anybody from getting used to anything. Coke will drop a campaign if there’s a lot of public griping, such as with the insane degree of product placement in the second season of American Idol.\n\n"
