Now that I’ve got your attention...\n\nI recently saw an ad with this great typeface that I wonder if anyone can i.d. for me. below are lots of examples.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164433im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/g1_5017.png)\n  \n(I love the innuendo of that one!)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164433im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/g2_4930.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164433im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/g3_5215.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164433im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/g4_4170.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164433im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/g5_3479.png)\n\nIn the print ad, I could see that the face has rough edges (not so easy to see at 72ppi). I’m much more interested in the letterforms themselves, so if anyone knows comparable faces without the rough edges, please advise.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ (x) Upright italic 'f' - various {gang}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164433/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43616 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Varig ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164433/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43720 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I think it’s the comparatively light joining of the bowls to stems, and the like. Granted, this is one of the defining characteristics...\n\nHermes is pretty hot. I wish the heavier weights didn’t have as much stroke contrast, but that Thin weight is nice!\n\n"
