Marketing was slower and more expensive then (in relative currency) so I would imagine producing a specimen book and other sales materials with enough faces to make the typesetter customer feel justified in purchasing the system and machinery.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Not even the [Linotype History](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124044738/http:/www.linotype.com/10-10-10-14022/1886.html?PHPSESSID=4fca5554419fd1628ef927a089d5f962) page on their site has a reference on it (that I could find).\n\nSome simple clues will probably lead us there:\n\n- Whitelaw Reid of the New York Tribune was one of the key financial backers of Ottmar Mergenthaler.\n- At an exhibition in Washington, D.C. in 1885, Mergenthaler was offered $300,000 for the rights to his prototype machine. For this sum, a group of publishers headed by Whiteclaw Reid bought controlling interest in the National Typographic Company which later was renamed the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. \n- A more or less usable model was presented to the New York Tribune on July 3, 1886.\n\nA type detective would need to do the following:  \n- Find out what metal fonts were used by the New York Tribune/Times just prior to July 1886.  \n- Find out the actually date of publication of the first commercial use of Mergenthaler's _Blower_ which it was called just prior to being called a _Linotype machine_. (The assumption is that the New York Tribune/Times was the first use, but that needs more research.)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124044738im_/http:/typophile.com/files/NYTimes1881.png)\n  \n_On a quick search,_ The New York Times, _July 1881, was the closet paper I found prior to July 1886._\n\nKey questions -- what would you consider the FIRST LINOTYPE typeface?  \n- The earliest attempts while developing the prototype of the _Blower_?  \n- The first typeface that could be set when the name _Linotype_ was first used?  \n- The first commercially available type matrice for the Linotype?\n\nCLUE -- It was Colonel Mustard, with the candlestick, in the Pantry.\n\n"
