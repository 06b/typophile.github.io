The first uses a consistent letter spacing but a variable size to achieve a justified look, and the second uses consistent size but variable letter spacing to achieve the same result.\n\nAre there any rules governing this or is it left up to the designer?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041036/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%203_9.jpg) | 37.13 KB |\n\n [‹ Recommend an 'Asian-y' typeface (sans serif)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041036/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47699 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lost thread -- lovemore ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122041036/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47679 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The relationship between the letters on different lines may be graphically interesting, but the proximity results in visual confusion for a person attempting to read it. Which is more important to you and the client?\n\nThe tracking should remain loose, although I agree that it should be tighter.\n\nThe rest, I think, is subjective.\n\n"
