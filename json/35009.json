Do chemists’ use them? Electricians?\n\nCertainly I see how they can be designed within a family style etc but what about their placement in the glyph? For instance: Other than the other arrows what glyphs should they work well with? A lower case o? Or the Numerals? Or Parentheses? Actually I see it could vary from arrow to arrow. The round ones vs the straight. The spilt vs. the whole...\n\nThanks!\n\n",

It would be nice to have a set of arrows for different purposes. Often I set the size of the to the same x-height as its related typeface. But, its all about the style of the arrow. It needs to match the design aesthetic that is being created for the site as a whole. That is why multiple arrow styles would be great. I know I ask a lot . . .\n\n"

All other uses are essentially clip art\\* related rather than typographic in nature. I can imagine that an arrow which matches the chosen font might be good to have as well but I suspect that custom arrows will be used more in part because the arrows in a font are harder to access ( I guess you could create a font in the Opentype set called ’symbols’....) but mostly because I think graphic designers will usually want something impossible to anticipate. In any event it probably isn’t going to pay to sweat this very often even if you are just supporting Math use.\n\n\\* This probably sounds more dismissive & pejorative than I intended...\n\nJames, Shu, Paul - What arrows would you want to match within a type face?

Mathematicians are notorious for trying to come up with new symbols and such. But those are the basics that will cover the majority of math setting.\n\nWhen a researcher comes up with a new formula, he/she often wants a special character to represent a certain important variable. First used are Greek characters ... you will be familiar with the large Sigma used for summation, and pi used for that number.\n\nThey also will use script characters (l is common to avoid confusion with 1, although a good designer should have chosen fonts where there is no confusion), Hebrew characters, Fracktur characters, and the outlined characters shown.\n\nThe symbols are variations of basic symbols. For instance, the less than or equal to sign can have one or two lines under it, or one or two curved lines, each meaning different things to different mathematicians. I’d tell you what they mean, but I can’t. I just typeset the stuff (back then). I didn’t understand it.\n\n"

I have recently been persuaded to include several historic Cyrillic characters in a retail font, why, I don’t know, as there are probably 2 or 3 people in the world who might use such a thing, and they are not font buyers (I don’t expect those who persuaded me to include the characters to buy the fonts either) —however, it is entertaining for a type designer to investigate such novelties, and we are “completists” by nature.\n\nThe WGL4 which includes arrows and boxes does so, I believe, because it covers four Unicode groupings, one of which includes arrows and boxes, for no particular reason, other than they might as well be grouped somewhere.\n\nWhat is the correlation between what is useful to font buyers and what is in fonts?  \nThis has been cocked up digitally from day one, as you can tell just by looking at your keyboard.\n\nThese days, wayfinding systems don’t use serif fonts, conventional wisdom being that these are less legible and therefore unsuitable, so Kris, why bother? Why not add something equally useless, such as a unicase or Bold Italic Small Caps?\n\nIf your typeface really is designed for a specific use, then some special characters which address that usage can act as a “gimmick” to draw attention to that and position the typeface in the marketplace/collective conscious. Otherwise, they are a distraction and a dilution, and may even be counter-productive by suggesting inappropriate usage.\n\nThe astrological symbols in Josh Darden’s Corundum were spot on, a genuine novelty in a font (quaint ct and st ligs have been done), but appropriate to the genre.

So from a user perspective, I will try to share my impressions of which arrow symbols are actually used in mathematics, though with an algebraist bias. I don’t have that many maths books with me right now as I keep them at work, so I might be missing a few.\n\nMost mathematical typesetting I’ve seen require no more than the basic single arrow (’→’ shows up everywhere including maps and limits) and double arrows (’⇒’ denotes logical implication). Also fairly common are the arrows with bars at one end (’↦’ is used to denote that an element is mapped to something). Don’t forget, all these will have corresponding slashed versions (i.e. ’↛’) to denote negation.\n\nIn lectures, I’ve seen a double-headed arrow (’↠’) used for surjection and an arrow with a tail (’↣’) used for injection. I’ve seen very few typeset examples of those, though.\n\nIn handwriting, arrows are sometimes used like diacritical marks to denote that the letters symbolize vectors (’⃗’ over a dotless ’i’, for example). In typesetting, however, vectors are indicated by using bold letters, i.e. **i**.\n\nI really love Kris’s arrows designed to harmonize with the text. But for mathematical typesetting, simple geometric arrows generally suffice. I think a dingbat font with arrows in different weights and styles designed to be combined with a large range of typefaces would be enough to do the job.\n\n"

Especially for the longer and wacky ones, they feel more like graphics than glyphs, or, to be more precisely, occupy the hinterland, neither exactly one nor the other. Certainly for things like commutativity diagrams, I’d much rather see them synthesized based on the geometry of the diagram rather than just pulled out of a font file like so much digitized 18th century metal.

Less importantly, characters 21A0 (“maps onto” or “maps surjectively” or “epimorphism”) and 21AA (“maps 1—1 into” or “maps injectively” or “monomorphism”) might serve. Off course that student would also need other mathematical symbols that are not arrows. If that student uses Word, there is an equation editor where all the basic characters can be selected.\n\nMore in line with Raph’s comment, if I use the amsart (American Mathematical Society) LaTeX package for articles, when I want a “if and only if”, I type \\iff and what comes out is a nice thing made out of two glyphs that look like one: a double left arrow and a double right arrow glued together.\n\n"

Arrow diagrams occupy a nether region which is neither pure text layout as in book paragraphs nor pure graphic design like drawing a portrait in Illustrator. In this way, they are somewhat similar to tables, just a little different graphically. You _can_ with some pain fake tables using paragraphs and tabs (that’s basically what the tab function is for, historically at least), and you can also make tables in Illustrator, but both approaches involve serious compromises. The serious problem with treating it as pure graphics is that it becomes very difficult to do simple operations like adding a row or column, or even changing the size of one already existing.\n\nSince the problem is so thorny, there are several different approaches. TeX pretty much holds down the “text” end of the spectrum, using a complex ASCII markup that is actually a relatively powerful programming language. Since the user base of TeX tends to be computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists, and statisticians, this actually works out pretty well.\n\nBut I definitely agree, if you’re a graphic designer without deep semantic knowledge of what the diagram means, and the ability to code that in the typesetting system’s programming language, then you are better off pretending it’s pure graphics, and just sacrifice some of the fluidity in being able to edit and adapt it.\n\nI say tables and arrow diagrams fairly interchangeably here. There are important differences between the two, but the structure of the problem is similar, and, in the case of the chemistry diagram posted by John above, it’s clear from the grid alignment that the tool used to create the diagram was in fact some form of table.\n\n"

In book production in that time of galleys of phototype, it was nearly impossible, without huge cost.\n\nThus TeX was built to allow any characters to be built into fonts, and Knuth even invented a program for creating fonts called Metafont.\n\nAs Russel says, today graphics are a completely viable alternative. In fact, when I include math in my equations today in web-based courses, I use graphics, due to the inconsistent handling of math by different browsers. A gif will always show up. (I do feel bad that my pages are less accessible to the handicapped, as the alt tags only say “math formula”).\n\n"
