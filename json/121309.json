Have you also done research in what kind of typefaces are currently being used in the industry and how you would like to stay with this style or select something contrasting? I could name random beautiful sans typefaces but I like to put more thought behind it. Typefaces shouldn't be selected merely because they're beautiful. You need to consider your target audience and the atmosphere you're going for as well.\n\nSo, could you give more information on what you're doing? Can you give the name of the business and do you have a symbol to show?\n\n"
