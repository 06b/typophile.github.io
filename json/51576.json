Like the regular Italic, the Mrs Eaves Bold Italic style includes a large collection of [ligatures](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202022820/http:/www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?PMEJLigBI.html), ranging from the common to the fanciful.\n\nZuzana Licko designed Mrs Eaves in 1996, as a reinterpretation of Baskerville. Now, the Bold Italic style adds even more versatility to the Mrs Eaves family.\n\nIn her rendition of this classic typeface, Licko addressed the sharp contrast, which was highly criticized in Baskervilleâ€™s time. Her reduced contrast interpretation retains an overall openness and lightness, while mixing a modern drawing approach with familiar classic details, making it a highly legible design that is reminiscent of a time past.\n\nView, order, and read more information about the Mrs Eaves family here:  \n [http://www.emigre.com/MrsEaves](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202022820/http:/www.emigre.com/MrsEaves)\n\nAvailable in Macintosh, Windows or OpenType formats.\n\nThe Mrs Eaves [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202022820/http:/www.emigre.com/ot.php?id=109) Bold Italic font includes the following features:  \nExtensive Ligatures, Proportional Old Style Numbers, Proportional Lining Numbers, Tabular Old Style Numbers, Tabular Lining Numbers.\n\nOther fonts in the Mrs Eaves OpenType family include the following features:  \nSmall Caps, Petite Caps, Extensive Ligatures, Proportional Old Style Numbers, Proportional Lining Numbers, Tabular Old Style Numbers, Tabular Lining Numbers, Superior Numbers and Scientific Inferior Numbers, Numerator and Denominator, Fractions, Arbitrary Fractions, and Ornaments.\n\nAccessing typographic features in OpenType fonts requires an Adobe OpenType savvy application, such as InDesign 2, Photoshop 6 or Quark 8.\n\n",
