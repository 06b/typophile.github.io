  "content": " **Hi guys,**\n\nI just created a new custom logotype for one of my friend, it's somewhat final already, but I think it would be good if I could get some feedback/opinion from other person. I'd like to know what might be improved, which is I can still do. This might be useful for my upcoming project as well.\n\n[Here is the link](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421184222/http:/bit.ly/1H7LIS2)\n\nI hope some of you could give me a constructive feedback, I'm new here, please tell me if anything wrong with my post\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421184222im_/http:/typophile.com/files/asklausen-1_3678.png)\n\n",

      "content": "I agree that the \"a\" is ambiguous. Looking at your sketches, moving the gap up would go a long way to resolving that issue and making it clearer.\n\nAlso, when working with handwritten typography, I feel it's important to follow the logic of actual handwriting as much as possible since viewer's brains are \"conditioned\" to perceive a flow that is familiar to them. When you break that flow or do something counter to intuitive expectations, you set yourself up visual discord in the final product. The \"a\" is an example of that...the natural break is where the stroke is reversed, up at the top, not in the middle.\n\nRelated to that, the \"s\"'s look odd to me since they are not not cursive. I think the cursive \"s\" letters in your sketches work better, although perhaps since the client chose a different version you don't have a choice.\n\nI'm also not comfortable with the left-leaning tabs or \"ears\" that you've put atop the ascenders. They run counter to the flow and energy of the graphic. I think you'd be better off, with a cleaner result, if you left them off and just left the tops slanted down to the right.\n\nLastly, the variation in the vertical height of the letters seems a bit off to me. It gives a \"bumpy\" quality to the mark. While I assume the point was to inject some informality to the mark, it does not have the right rhythm to me and ends up feeling a bit awkward.\n\n"
