I think it would be great for fashion magazines or music booklets.\n\nPlease let me know what you think and if it's too close to something existing I din't think of yet (I know there are some connections to Avant Garde but I think it wouldn't be too close).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317161753im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fashion-font-specimen1_5673.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Good concept. Things like E, F, K are the big strength.\n\nWhat you need to do is round out your curves. S, O, Q are good; you should want to make the other curved letters remind you of them. U should not be flat on the bottom. C needs to taper the curve into the horizontals more smoothly with regard to weight. The same thing is not quite as noticeable in D but it would help. G you may need to rethink entirely.\n\nThe stacked LL needs more space in it. CC is a good guide for the amount of space.\n\n"

For example, compared to the R, the B seems a bit simple, or the R too decorative.\n\nI like some words (Fireworks could make a great logo), but it maybe needs more research in the overall.\n\nI hope you'll not find my opinon to hard, and this is just my opinion.\n\nBest regards.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you Bernard,\n\nfunny thing is, that it all started with the R. Although I have to admit this is the character that is a bit off the grid. I already re-arranged the R to fit it into the grid but it looked awful. Just like it would hinder the concept instead of supporting it. So I left it that way. It's still the character I don't know what will happen to it.\n\nAfter your post I think it's a good point to rethink the B and offer a second character just like with A, V, W or M for example.\n\nAnd your totally right, I also think that it's possible to do some great logo-type with this font. 'VIKTOR & ROLF' or 'COSMOPOLITAN' are already some examples I like.\n\nThank you for your thoughts\n\n"

The R in RocknRolla is very easily read, but stylistically isn't as good as the other two R's I mentioned in my opinion. Not a big fan of the R in Birdie.\n\n"
