I'd like to know in which font the word \"Coffee\" above the \"classic\" is written, and also the \"classic\", which reminds me of Mistral, although, to my untrained eyes, all calligraphic fonts look similar.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Binner D \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [bojev](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420210703/http:/typophile.com/user/7409 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
