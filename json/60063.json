  "content": "Hello all!\n\nI formatted my CV to Grid. I would like some feedback. I have never done grid before and I feel I have trivialized it far too much. I also fear that I went with form before function, but I will leave that for you to decide.\n\nCurrently, it is at it is. I want to expound on my responsibilities underneath \"Experience\" because I want to make sure that my potential employer is aware that my tasks weren't vapid; that I actually did things. Also: If any of you are aware of what to properly include in an American CV, and see that I did not include that, please offer those thoughts as well. I am working on an 8.5in x 11in piece of paper, portrait, and am tempted to see if I can keep it one page.\n\nThis was done in InDesign. I used Lucida Fax which I have recently become fond of. It sits nicely. But that is up for debate as well.\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

      "content": "I suggest changing \"information\" to \"Contact\" (isn't the entire cv information?). Delete using the actual word \"Address\" and group all of your addresses under the bar, the same with your Education information. Your design makes sense with how you organized your employment, having the position in one column and the responsibilities under the gray bar, but to use that same treatment for contact info and listing your schools doesn't work. Or you could have the bars align with the left column and handle your name in a different manner. Your spacing is inconsistent, compare the white space from the bottom of the gray bar to the base line of \"School Address\" and the white space from the bottom of the gray bar to the baseline of \"Saint Joseph\" and same for third bar as well.\n\n"
