He uses all three parts as a last name, so it starts near his waist, goes up to the neck, and then all the way back down again.\n\nTo the original question, I like the Auzzie shirts (the first #9) in the images. The number font doesn't look as impressive up close, but it was very cool looking from fan/tv viewer range.\n\n"
