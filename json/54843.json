I searched magazines for anything and everything that began with the letter C, and this is what I came up with.\n\nDescription:\n\nThis Collage depicts a Chick Chatting on her Cellphone as her Convertible Collides into a Covergirl Clutching her Champagne Colored Chance Chanel as the Contents of the Cranium of a Conair Carrying Cutie (including Cosmetics, Curve, Cats, and of course the letter C) spills and Crashes onto the Car.\n\n",
