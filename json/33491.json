So I'm curious what websites the type community thinks make the best use of type on the web. I'll start.\n\n[A List Apart](http://web.archive.org/web/20100711093535/http:/alistapart.com/ \"Visit the site and see for yourself\") takes full advantage of the best of the web typefaces. Sure they're just Georgia and Verdana, but when used well as they are here, they add real sophistication to a design.\n\n[Khoi Vinhâ€™s Subtraction](http://web.archive.org/web/20100711093535/http:/www.subtraction.com/%3Ca \"See for yourself\") proves that type can look great on the web if used properly. Here a single font (Arial) is leveraged to its full potential with the aid of a strong underlying grid layout.\n\nWhat sites inspire you to use type better on the web?\n\n",
