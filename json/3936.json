I have looked at the unicode site Hrant posted and found it under 'letterlike symbols'. Now all I want to know is if I can use any latin \"e\" as that symbol or is there a specific keystroke sequence to produce it? Key Caps isnt giving me any joy.   \n   \nMartin, are they still using the Drachmer or have they switched to Euro? (sorry, from Australia) ;)   \n   \nBren\n\n"

      "content": "Bren, I think there might be no specific location for the \"estimated\" symbol. That's probably because it is considered more of a symbol/logo than a glyph. The only place were you can find it is in specific logo- and symbolfonts, and its location varies.   \n   \nAnd I must disagree with your opinion about the \"euro\", there are some fine designs in currently issued typefaces. It's very similar in concept to the dollar or yen-sign. You just have to stay away as far as possible from the official geometric Euro \"logotype\" as found in Adobe Euro Sans... ugh.   \n   \nIf you wanna find out which currencies became obsolete, check [The Universal Currency Converter(tm)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080522023819/http:/www.xe.net/currency/). When you select one of those currencies, it gives you a warning.\n\n"
