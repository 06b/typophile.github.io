  "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI am creating a logo for a neighborhood. This is not an official state or city entity, but the logo will be used by an small business association to advertise various neighborhood events sponsored by local businesses. Mt. Airy is well known for being a diverse community with a lot of emphasis on progressive politics (its where the hippies live).In short I am looking to create something casual, fun, & contemporary (but definitely not corporate.)\n\n1. I am looking for input on the sketches below  \n2. I am looking for typefaces to inspire and inform the characteristics of the letter forms in the logo (as the logo will usually appear alongside the name of various events).\n\nSo far I been looking at the likes of Cheltenham, ITC Grouch, Bernhard Antiqua, they feel not quite contemporary enough, was considering Los Feliz from Emigre for a more up to date look...any other suggestions?\n\nThanks! Malcolm.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152842im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/mtairy06_5691.gif)\n\n [‹ Sexy? logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152842/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37108 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Please provide critique ASAP Thank you ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152842/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37280 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I like the second one (less line under the name compare wiht the third one where I find there are too much line under) and finally I like what you’ve done with the A in the third one . What I’d suggest is as mix of the one and the third. Hoping this will help you not mix up you too much. = :¬)\n\n"

      "content": "well. let’s put it this way. Mount Airy is a complete community. So I guess both words should be connected. In this perspective #2 works best.\n\nSince A is rather wide compared to M, I’d widen the M a bit by slanting vertical stems outwards on the bottom.\n\nAnd make sure that A’s swash doesn’t go all the way to the end of “y”, because the curve also doesn’t go all the way to the left of the M.\n\n#3 has too many lines underneath, #1 seems closed... Because you close Airy to itself and M swash intrudes the Airy...\n\nI’d definitely go with #2... With corrections.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for the comments.Another possible solution here, I sometimes feel as if the connected letters are a bit “fake” or contrived...as if that would never happen if I were writing these swashes (as opposed to drawing them). This solution addresses that issue as well as those raised by litera. This drawing is bit rougher that then the other two.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152842im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/mtairy06_3601.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "I prefer the third option in the latest iteration, where each swash is only connected to one letter. However, I would “weave” the downward swash from the ’A’ between the other two as in your other two designs. You could also try weaving them the other way (over the top, under the bottom).\n\nThe swashes both come off the word “Airy” - this may be intentional, but you might want to try one with a swash off the ’M’ and ’y’ to bookend the name, or even ’M’, ’A’, and ’y’ all interwoven but not connected.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

While Cheltenham might be a good choice (you might consider Horley Oldstyle also), they, in conjunction with the swashes, remind me of old British motorcycle logos for Norton and Triumph, I would take a look at a sans source like [Aspect](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152842/http:/www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm) or [Estilo Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152842/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/estilo-script/).\n\nTim\n\n"
