  "content": "This sample was sent to me asking to know what font the [Costa Cruise](http://web.archive.org/web/20121120024036/http:/www.costacruises.com/) folks were using on their site . The E is shaped like a C with a line in the middle, the 'a' is single-storey, the U has a stem, and the 'y' has a u-shaped bowl. It doesn't show up in the Sans Serif ID Guide, even though its attributes are distinctive, and there were enough letters to assign the full set of style codes.\n\nAnyone recognize this font? Thanks for any help.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [costa font.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20121120024036/http:/typophile.com/files/costa%20font_0.gif) | 16.2 KB |\n\n",
