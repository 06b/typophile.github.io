  "content": "This question goes out to the governing bodies of Typophile.\n\nEben Sorkin, Bruce Herbert and moi have been discussing the possibility of creating a Flash “game” (exercise is a better term) that would roughly simulate the ancient task of composing hand-set type, hence the name “ [Upside Down & Backwards](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180730/http:/typophile.com/node/14525).”  \nThis is one of a few educational or entertaining projects under discussion that might be of interest to design educators and graphic design students alike.\n\nWhen the project is finally completed, we would like to make it openly available for download from the [Typographic Edumacators](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180730/http:/typophile.com/forum/16) section (a sadly under utilized topic area). The participants in the project look only for a credit line or such and want to know if Typophile is interested in holding the copyrights or intellectual property. I’ve noticed that the page footer declares “© 2000-2005 Typophile, All Rights Reserved. Typophile is a Punchcut gig.”\n\nQuestions:  \n— Is the Typophile organization interested in hosting such projects?  \n— Is the Typophile organization a legal entity that can hold a copyright?  \n— Can we start some dialog on these issues before we procede any further?\n\nWe can follow up via email instead of through this topic if preferred.  \nThanks.\n\n [‹ Feeling lost with my thesis](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180730/http:/typophile.com/node/15080 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Essential typefaces ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180730/http:/typophile.com/node/13858 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Also, you dont have to be a legal entity to retain copy rights.\n\nIf for some strange reason you wanted to transfer IP and rights to Typophile (which most likeley would either be Punchcut, or one or more of its owners), Typophile would comission ’work for hire’, and the designers/developers would transfer all rights to them through this work for hire contract.\n\nI have a good amount of knowledge in the legality of copy rights and trademark law.

We are not engaged in any emplyment either, our brains are not being paid for, so any ideas that we may com up with are our own. If it came to hosting a project, then that may be a different matter, because there would be money changing hands. If we were paid up members (which I am yet...waiting tho) then we would be sharing the cost of the hosting, which would change things too.  \nThe original proposal was to actually investigate letting the FORUM have the rights, which is kind of different to where the thread was heading. I guess then what would need to happen is to ensure that it was indeed accessible to all, and that people involved got due credit for their work. I for one am happy to go into it knowing full well that I am relinquishing my rights to IP on the previso that it remains open to everyone, and that my name is on it saying what I did. But I am not actually sure if I need to sign anything over, we just say, here it is everyone, oh, and by the way if you use it, just remember to credit us. And any cash if fine too.  \nIf it turns out that someone decides to turn it into a commercial product, with or without our knowledge, then that’s something else again. It’s a risk I don’t mind taking. After all, it’s what opensource is built on.  \nOK, end of rant.\n\n"

That content lived on the About page, which got (inappropriately) nixed in the redesign. Look for a notice about this soon.\n\nDespite the notion of granting permission by default, to date we have only used people’s content generated here (words and images) with their verbal or written (usually email) permission.\n\nI think any forum or blog would have a very difficult time in a court trying to say that it held exclusive rights to intellectual property posted in forum discussions or as comments to articles. Likewise though, I have heard of cases of forums being sued for comments that users make there — as if the forum controls and is responsible for user input. That notion is being heavily challenged in court though.\n\n"

And because this form of thinking about type has historical interest.\n\nIf Typophile is seen to agree through affiliation with the project, the project is more likely to be used and by more people. Also I think Norbert would like to see the project made available to both Typophiles and Conference Attendees. Affiliation might be helpful there too.\n\n"
