Check out [Mike Yanega's site](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603080659/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg1.html) for a selection. There's nothing there, though, that remotely looks like the Budweiser B. If all you need is a clean version of the logo, though, go to [Brands of the World](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603080659/http:/web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&query_id=3139212&page=1&brand_id=26990). You can also do a search there for Budweiser and find a lot of Bud logos.   \n   \n(And Miller ones, too!)\n\n"
