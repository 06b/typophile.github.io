  "content": "Hello.  \nI purchased ITC Avant Garde Gothic from Adobe a few years ago. I’d love to have the alternates to use with it. Does anyone know of a version of the alternates I can buy that is compatible/drawn to match? Is the Elsner+Flake Avant Garde Gothic Alternates compatible with the Adobe/ITC version, or would I need to buy the entire E+F Avant Garde family?  \n(I did do a search of past Typophile posts about this, but they didn’t seem entirely clear to me)\n\nThanks for any help you can offer me...\n\n [‹ Open Source QT to WMV Converters???](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612044317/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46117 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Turn your fonts into fabrics ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612044317/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46062 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Unfortunately you’re going to get a slightly different height and weight from the two versions. You need to buy the whole family from one foundry or the other.\n\nFor those who want ease of use, I recommend [ITC Avant Garde Gothic Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612044317/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_avant_garde_gothic_pro_virtual/) which has the alternates and ligatures built into a single OpenType font for each weight. For those who want the alts but value [true italics](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612044317/http:/typographica.org/001029.php), the only choice is the [E+F digitization](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612044317/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=elsner+flake%20avant%20garde).\n\n"
