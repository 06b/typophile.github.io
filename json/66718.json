  "content": "Just found this, and thought I'd share it with everyone:\n\nAs designers, we sometimes forget that not everyone can see color the same way we do. I found a sweet app that allows you to simulate what color blindness does to your designs, whether it be interface design or the composition of a 4-color poster.\n\nHere's an example of this page as viewed by someone with color blindness:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714003358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/picture-2010-01-27-at-9_4377.01.45-AM.jpg)\n\nSo this free app for Windows, Linux and Mac simulates how approximately 5% of all men will see your designs. It's a pretty cool app to add to your toolbox o' design stuff.\n\nAnyway, the app is here [http://colororacle.cartography.ch/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714003358/http:/colororacle.cartography.ch/ \"http://colororacle.cartography.ch/\")\n\n",

Only because the elements like the Font Bureau advert are on the same page enabling side-by-side comparison do I see that the colours are actually different. When people with normal colour vision see the above sample and immediately notice that the colours are off?\n\n"
