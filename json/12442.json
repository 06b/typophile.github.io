He attended school at Leeds Polytechnic where he earned a Dip. AD in Fine Art.\n\nIn 1976 he moved to [Toronto](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Toronto), [Canada](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Canada), where he worked as an art director and creative director at a number of Toronto advertising agencies from the 1970s into the 1980s. In 1989 he started ShinnDesign, his own digital studio, specializing in publication design. Nick has designed everything from books and magazines to web sites.\n\nSince 1980 he has designed over 20 typeface families, some for respected publishers, including Walburn and Brown for the Canadian daily \"The Globe and Mail.\" Many of Nick's early type designs were published by various [foundries](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Foundries), most notably the [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) library. In 1999 he launched [ShinnType](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ShinnType), which now publishes and markets his fonts worldwide. Nick is a prolific writer and often contributes to \"Graphic Exchange\" magazine, as well as many other publications. He has also had speaking engagements at conferences such as [ATypI](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ATypI) and [TypeCon](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TypeCon) and was a member of the board for [The Society of Typographic Afficionados](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typophile.com/wiki/SoTa).\n\nOf his typeface designs, Shinn says, “Beautiful letters aren’t enough to make a successful typeface; I also want to create faces that are design solutions.”\n\nlinks:  \n [ShinnType](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/www.shinntype.com/)  \n [Say Hello to Nick Shinn](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922191009/http:/typographi.com/000814.php)\n\n",
