  "content": "Hi!  \nI'm a fontaholic from Finland and new here. Since I haven't gotten an answer for months after posting in WhatTheFont forums I thought it might be best to put my request here!  \nThe only info I have foung is that it might be a Letragraphic(what's that?) font from the 70's.  \nIt was used by Deep Purple as a band logo around 1974 as well as on some albums and tourbooks. The sample is from the album Made in Europe.  \nHaven't really seen this any other place.  \nThankful for any help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051942im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dpfont_5907.jpg)\n\n",

The Mk 3 logo I'm pretty sure came from a special designers' series produced by Letraset for their dry-transfer range. Called Letragraphica, these were sold mainly to designers to keep them exclusive - a much higher retail price also helped. You might be able to trace this by sending a scan to their web site enquiry address.\n\nThe Made In Japan font is a puzzle. It may well be hand-drawn - the letter \"P\" isn't totally consistent - but that could just be poor printing. EMI Spain used extra letters in the font on their version of the anniversary CD, but whether they traced the original or simply made them up digitally I don't know.\n\nThe font used for the word Fireball on the sleeve was commercially available and has been digitised, though I don't know the name. So, an opportunity for someone out there to do some research! There is a type library and museum in London who might be able to help, but I don't know how far up to the present their collection is. They do have the font designed for British Overseas Airways Corporation which I've always loved, and I'd like to go down and scan this some day. But that's another story.  \nSimon (with his graphic designers hat on) Robinson.\n\n"
