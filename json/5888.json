  "content": "We are using an old font, Font Company Garamond Light for one of our publications. Using OS X and InDesign, I notice that the font conflicts w/ ITC Garamond, even when not open. I believe these fonts are very close; there are 16 fonts within each typeface, corresponding to each other.   \n   \nAnyone know the origin on The Font Company's Garamond vs. Adobe's ITC Garamond? Were they based on the same glyphs? They don't substitute exactly -- I need to bump up size of ITC to correspond to the Font Company's size.\n\n",
