You want more than that? I'd like to know more too. Cassandre and Excoffon; two wonderful French innovators of type design.\n\n"

I found this out when looking at the wonderful Lexicon specimen book.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "I can't say what Gill was thinking, but I can point out some design issues for which that might seem like a reasonable solution.   \n   \nWhen a font weight gets that heavy, it is helpful to increase the x-height, allowing heavier horizontal strokes in letters with several horizontals such as a and e.   \n   \nHowever, once you get a really large x-height, if the i dot is to maintain an appropriate relative weight, it ends up above the descender height! Something has to give. One solution might be to make the linear part of the i much shorter than the x-height. Having tried this, I think at the extremes (Gill Ultra/Kayo), it looks as goofy as the miniaturized dot, because the main part of the i ends up so far below the x-height. So it becomes a question of which aspect of the design has to \"give.\"   \n   \nMy $.02, anyway.   \n   \nT\n\n"

It was the \"humanizing\" of the face that makes it so beautiful, in my humble opinion.   \n   \nI'm not sure it has been 'proved' that Gill Sans derived from Johnston's face. I'm not arguing it didn't. Gill was in on the design of the Johnston face for the first three (or so) meetings. Johnston's face suffers from too much geometry in the wrong places and Gill avoided this with the humanist approach.   \n   \nI'm not sure I entirely agree (or disagree) that the English design the best faces. What about the French? I've come to appreciate the beautiful eccentricities, and I mean that as a compliment, of the lettering styles of the earlier part of the 20th century. I never did appreciate those faces, such as Choc and Vendome, until listening to Gerard Unger's seminar on French design. By the way, does anyone know of where I might find more information on Roger Excoffon? Preferably in English, but my brother speaks French.\n\n"
