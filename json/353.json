I'm assuming you are meaning, why are those corner points of the z and e more of a broad round angle?   \n   \nIf that is what you mean, on earlier iterations I did that and the Z looked like a 2. So I wanted to accentuate the angle a bit more for that to stand out. Plus I think it adds a little bit more character.   \n   \nthanks, perhaps I will revisit....\n\n"

      "content": "Peter,   \n   \nI think what he's getting at is this:   \nIt looks like you've made this by drawing a line in   \nillustrator, then adding weight to it (with rounded corners,   \nand ends). This means that all parts of the characters are   \nthe same width. However optically, verticals look skinny   \ncompared to horizontals of exactly the same size. So you   \nhave two options, 1) make all the horizontals fatter or 2)   \nmake the verticals skinnier. JFP's suggestion is a good one,   \nfix the verticals because there's only three of them, the f   \nand the left and right parts of the u.   \n   \nYou can go crazy here, because in reality optical   \nadjustments arent just for horizontals and verticals. What   \nabout diagonals? Think of a circle. Thinnest at top, thicker,   \nthicker thicker thicker Thickest at the middle and thinner   \nagain on the bottom. So diagonals should also fall   \nsomewhere in between. Hope that made some sense. It   \nwon't need much to make it look optically right.   \nJust a pinch.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

In my case, I found 80% of serif typefaces have too thinner vertical in N and V, etc.!!!!\n\n"
