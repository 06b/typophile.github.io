Car logos have been my best resource so far,  \nbut industrial style product or company logos would really be good. Attached is some of what I've found.  \nAny help would be much appreciated.  \nThanks,  \nDan Cotton\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1930-50s logo samples.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417160927/http:/typophile.com/files/1930-50s%20logo%20samples.jpg) | 94.11 KB |\n\n",
