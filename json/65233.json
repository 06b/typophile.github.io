Maybe the film type Othello would have been used, assuming it had other forms, but Fiorello doesn't seem to be a match.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Does anyone else have a copy they can scan so we can prove Othello is the right answer? (I believe it is) Unfortunately, other than that Outline version on the Dover CD, I have heard of no other digital versions of the typeface used on that book cover. What was the publication date? If it was the 70's they probably used film type, I would guess.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
