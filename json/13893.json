      "content": "I have to agree that numbers separated by a space into groups of three or four are easier to read and memorise, the line about dashes connecting numbers while dots separate seems self-defeating, especially given the example posted above. But as Mbusher says cultural conditioning may have something to do with this. But which European countries use dots to separate numbers? As far as I can remember France, Spain, Germany use groups of numbers either in pairs or threes or fours.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "Quite. I handle MSS from authors all over the place (UK & Europe, US & Canada, Asia, Far East, you name it) and I don't think I've seen many come in the authors' phone numbers split with dots. They would, indeed, look like an IP address and would be very odd. Most just use spaces, quite a few use hyphens, and a few, nothing at all. I agree that 'no separators' makes for a hard-to-read number; spaces and hyphens both look fine to me.\n\n"

      "content": "Reviving this old thread! I've searched as much as I can to find an answer, and this thread is as close as I've come.\n\nWhat do y'all think about using en dashes instead of hyphens in phone numbers?\n\nI've used them in the publication I'm working on, but have been told that it is incorrect, and I ought to use hyphens. I'm aware that en-dashed telephone numbers are not the norm in Canada (prolly not anywhere), but are they wrong?\n\nThe font I'm using has slightly slanted hyphens which I think look utterly silly in the phone numbers. I'd opt for periods or spaces, but that's likely too \"designy\" for their taste (their word, not mine).\n\nSo just wondering if there's some rule that I haven't found which states that the use of en dashes in phone numbers will cause the sky to fall.\n\nThanks!  \nK.\n\n"

      "content": "It depends on how the en dash looks in the font. Generally, the en dash is used to indicate a range of numbers, rather than as a separator. In the US the normal format for noting a phone number is\n\n(412)555-5555\n\nbut I've seen it frequently in recent years printed with dots or spaces replacing both the parentheses and hyphen. You could use en dashes if you want to, I guess, for display so long as it looks good. You just might raise editorial hackles should you try it in text.\n\n"

If the design is forced, well then, it's too designy -- but if it works, it's brilliant.  \nAfter all, how did Ladislav Sutnar ever come up with the idea of using parentheses to format area codes?\n\n"

      "content": "I agree that the en-dash is probably too wide, and will call too much attention to itself.\n\nWith regard to the parens for area codes, I suspect it is going away as more and more places require you to dial all 10 numbers, even locally.\n\n"
