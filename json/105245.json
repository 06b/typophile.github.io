Through your favorite Adobe applications – yes!\n\nThe Fonts.com Extension for Adobe Creative Cloud allows you to try, install and synchronize desktop fonts directly from within Adobe apps including Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. This extension also works with any [Fonts.com Web Fonts subscription plans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322023840/http:/www.fonts.com/web-fonts/plans-and-pricing), including free plans, making it free and easy to experiment with thousands of desktop fonts within your favorite design apps.\n\n“The Fonts.com Extension liberates designers to put type first, and makes working with fonts easy, fast and fun,” said Chris Roberts, vice president and general manager of Monotype’s e-commerce group.\n\nAll the functionality of Monotype’s [SkyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322023840/http:/skyfonts.com/) client for activating fonts is built into the extension. An unobtrusive window within the application allows subscribers to search for and activate fonts right in a document. Free plan subscribers can use the extension to initiate five minute trials of fonts while higher level subscribers can use the extension to install mockup fonts and desktop fonts included with their plans.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1.
