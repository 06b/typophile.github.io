Or maybe not ...   \n   \nIt seems to have begun its life as a version of a typeface that appears   \nin the Solotype Catalog as Chopin. Dieter Steffmann digitized it as   \n [Chopin Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826014149/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/c/chopin.htm). Here's [another](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826014149/http:/www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nb_ppp=40&texte=News&nq=1&q=chopin) Chopin Script by a 'Diogenes'. And you   \ncan also find it as [Chase Callas](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826014149/http:/members.dca.net/pheanix/msie/c5.htm) by the defunct Soft Horizons.   \n   \nOne of these, or yet another version, seems to have begat [Radagund](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826014149/http:/www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nb_ppp=40&texte=News&nq=1&q=radagund),   \n which I believe to be the font used.\n\n"
