That said, you always have the option of leaving if the work assigned to you bothers you ethically.\n\n"

I know I have one excellent piece of work, few other pieces that are good and others that are okay. I do not know how they are going to balance out but hopefully, someone will be happy to have me. (I hope) :) Any advice for ’do’s and don’ts’ for CV and portfolio?\n\nPS what do you think universities have to improve on? I know my tutor keeps informing us that they can not teach us everything and that employers inform them of what they expect out of graduates in the design industry i.e. graphic design. What do you personally think in regards to this issue? What is there too much or too little of which needs to be sorted drastically to mould the designers of the future.\n\n"

He had no ideas or enthusiasm at all, he shrugged and said “hmmm something collaborative”. When I graduated I could have given you a huge list of design jobs I’d love to try.\n\nI also agree with the idea of a simple, professional resume. One of my first jobs was doing clerical duties for an Architect. One of my tasks involved opening and filing the HUNDREDS of graduate student resumes that were sent to us. All got copied and filed, reviewed quickly by the business manager and very few got to the Director.\n\nHope these thoughts help somehow.\n\nZennie :)\n\n"

An insanely overpriced fake-leather book of sleeves  \n3. Metal books of sleeves  \n4. Printed pages worked into some kind of high-end binder  \n5. Really over-the-top handmade books  \n6. Loose items and boards to be passed around\n\nI seem to have the most luck with 6, because my biggest skill is the ability to explain every detail of my work. But it has killed me in interviews at firms that expect people to try and wow them with #5. #1 is another option I like because it is flexible, simple, and unpretentious. Is it ok to work sample pages into a simple portfolio book and have a few loose items to pass around at most places? I know that not having something really wild will always kill me at firms that expect a wild, hand-made portfolio with a nice leave-behind, but I don’t usually want to work for those people, so if it’s an uncommon problem I’m not too worried.\n\n"

Loose items and boards to be passed around\n\n^ that’s my pick.\n\nGranted, I don’t have a LOT of experience handing out physical portfolios, but the easiest portfolio for me was to print out color 8.5 x 11 ’boards’ (just laser prints) and bind with nice card stock cover using removable binders. Once in the interview, I can easily dismantle it to pass around.\n\nThe catch with ’wowing’ people with your actual portfolio case is that you REALLY have to wow them. Most tend to just burden their work with an overly ornate/pretentious package so, if anything, better to err on the side of simplicity (which is something we should remember in all facets of design, actually ;o)\n\n"

I’ve put work in PDF’s to send when applying for the job, but I’ve never felt putting together a book would be worth it in the end. Maybe it’s cost me some jobs, who knows, but my work is my work and I’d rather show it than select pages I think are the most attractive. Someday I might go for a book style, but online and PDF portfolios are widely accepted these days, and following it up with a few hard copies at the interview is acceptable in my books.\n\nThat said, depending on the field you are going in to, a well put together portfolio can show your own design sense and attention to detail when trying to land that first _good_ job.\n\n"
