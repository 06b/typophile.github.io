  "content": "Does it matter what degree classification you have? I mean a 1st or 2:1 or do you think too many people think too much about it, as they never get asked what classification they get in employment. Do they? At the 4 designers conference in London, they mentioned the fact that no one asks about it. Is this a good attitude to give out to students or erm...bad? WOuld just liek your views on it. Thanks.  \nPS isn't it the attitude, the personality, the way one thinks and the passion for design that REALLY matters or all of the above and more so? Please enlighten me.\n\nPPS Would you rather be daring when it comes to design and fail or would you be safe and get a good grade?\n\n",

Now... there's good and bad university's , some School's as James said can pass you a wrong idea of whats the industry or how it works leading many people to abandon design later on. And there's the good ones that will make you grow both professionally and as a person. On top of all that...there's the school as an Business so of course it's of they're best interest to appear on the charts.\n\nBasically for me where you studied or your grades are important at a first/superficial look/evaluation only to know something about you and your path. But what really matters for me is the works you did, your personality, your will and how you work.\n\nSo if you wanna do something risky and different, do it at school, and learn from it, explore yourself. See the other's reaction and take advantage that there's no client or money involved :) Just evolve as a person and learn something more then just designing, that's what's University is for.\n\n-\n\n[www.nunocoelho.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017084556/http:/www.nunocoelho.com/ \"www.nunocoelho.com\")\n\n"

That is a rare sort of person and you had better be honest with yourself about if that's the kind you are.\n\nThe converse is also true. Good grades at school don't always translate into success afterwards - but they don't hurt one bit. Not because the work itself is necessarily a key to or identical to what real jobs are like, but because learning how to hit the task hard and keep pushing until you get the result you want is not something everybody knows how to do. Getting good grades shows know how. That you have the will to get things done and are probably not going to be a prima dona about it.\n\n<cite> PS isn’t it the attitude, the personality, the way one thinks and the passion for design that REALLY matters or all of the above and more so? </cite>\n\nNo. They matter but they are far far far from being enough.

But I wonder if the era of the self-taught designer is still with us, or is it over?\n\nI stopped teaching at design schools, because I came to realize that I could no longer be apart of a factory system that takes in students, charges them extraordinary tuition, and essentially gives them vocational training, rather than an education. A small fraction of these students will go on and get work, the rest will do something else, but they will be ill prepared to do that something else since they have received a sub-standard education. Some of those ill-prepared students, who couldn't land a design job will go on to graduate school, rather than give up on their dream of a design career.\n\nAt approximately $40,000 a year for a top design school, how can you justify $160,000 to $250,000 in loans for a career that will start you out in the high $20K low $30K and will take years to advance to a modest 6 figure income?\n\nI don't have any real answers to my complaint. I have said before that design is the new acting, and every year students invest heavily to enter schools for both fields. The acting students go in with their eyes open, being told from the very beginning how difficult it is to make a living as an actor.

The trick is, the client gets to be nasty but the designer has to remain calm and positive. This is the thick skin part and why good people skills are important for success. Designers provide a service to a client. Clients can choose to use you for that service or hire someone else. Very few very sought after designers have the luxury of choosing clients. Those lucky few did not find themselves in that position by being nasty to clients. Designers have to learn how to be skillful communicators and collaborators. Would you hire someone who was nasty to you? There is a big difference between a designer who has done their homework and speaks effectively and can get their point across without negative behavior and an egocentric bully who is so demanding that nobody will work with them.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

A design can be quite successful and never satisfy the client, because clients may simply be stupid and desire random changes that undermine the requirements they set forth in the first place. Sometimes the designer has failed to communicate why the design works in a way the client can understand, but sometimes the client is just plain stupid.\n\nI once worked for a client who requested an advertisement on a very short timeline, designed to fit into an existing campaign. Several successful ads were produced, the client chose one…and requested a minor aesthetic change. The change was made, and then the client requested another, and another and so on. Fourteen color shifts, shadow angles, weight changes, etc. later the window of opportunity was past and the ad died. Every version was a successful design, but the client could not be satisfied because the client was stupid and refused to be satisfied.\n\n"
