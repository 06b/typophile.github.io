  "content": "Hi Folks!\n\nWe have an urgent question belonging to PC fonts.  \nWe have derived a font (working on Mac FontLab) and want to create a font usable on PC.  \nI have found so long options fpr creating the classic Mac suitcase fonts, another for Macintosh TrueType.  \nBut I didn’t find anything for making PC fonts (actually we tried the Mac TrueType- doesn’t run on PC)  \nWhat is the solution?\n\nThanks so far!  \nStefan\n\n [‹ Quartet Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164615/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44662 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Similar Fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705164615/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44722 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
