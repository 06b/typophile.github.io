(I've got it also on my to-do list to respond to the thread about caps, but boy do you and Hrant make it difficult to keep up...) So, here goes.\n\nFirstly, the Greek government would not give a monkey's for the aesthetics of the monotonic accent. The passing of monotonic in 1981 was one chapter in a very long debate going back several decades, but precipitated by politics and concerns by the local publishing industry, in the face of imminent capital investment and associated human resources costs. With hindsight, keeping in mind that this happened only three years before the DTP explosion (read \"me and my dog in my living room are a service bureau\") which was built on 8-bit fonts, this paved the way to font piracy and localisation of the most abysmal quality.\n\nAll the Greek reference works have stated, from day one, that the monotonic tonos is identical to a polytonic acute. Any dots, triangles, dashes, and such are wrong, ugly, and inappropriate for the formal characteristics of the script.\n\nIn reality, this must be tempered by the context in which it was expressed. Therefore, it is acceptable to design the tonos at a slightly different angle, length, and weight from the acute, since the tonos sits alone over vowels, and does not need to accommodate breathings -- but must always be right-inclined. My personal view is that diacritics should be designed to relate in stroke thickness and modulation to the lower-case glyphs; in other words, make them loud and clear.\n\nSo, Unicode is correct in this. Unfortunately, Lucida Grande is as poor in the Greek as it is good in the Latin, so Mac users do not reference out of the box.\n\nYou're doing well to be looking at what others have done, but you should be casting your eyes on a wider range of printed material, and -- why not? -- even writing examples.\n\n"

I'm sure it will provide a huge boost to Greek and Cyrillic typography, by opening up the design space available to typographers there (without meaning to be patronizing to local type designers) with new fonts with italics, bold, and small caps. I've also been impressed with Adobe and Typotheque's committment to supporting polytonic.\n\nWhile I had originally intended to produce only a monotonic font, I've been persuaded to go the whole hog.\n\nWould I be correct in assuming that, in creating a polytonic font, I can use Gentium and Minion Pro as models for the unicode values and accents?\n\nThe typeface I'm working on is a revival of a roman didone, from c.1870, featuring a strong vertical stress and absence of pen-written ductus. The Greek characters are new, as I was unable to discover any precedent that I considered to be sufficiently \"modern\". It seems to me that the correct tonos for monotonic use here is vertical. That would be no good for polytonic, as the tonos there must be angled, working in conjunction with the grave. Presently, I'm leaning towards the idea of making the text faces polytonic, and the display faces monotonic, with vertical tonos. A bit of a shame, as I liked the look of the vertical tonos in text. Is it really so inappropriate?\n\n[http://www.shinntype.com/Albany.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20110812103522/http:/www.shinntype.com/Albany.pdf \"http://www.shinntype.com/Albany.pdf\")\n\n"

What I think is a mistake is the fully vertical form.\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind that Chuck Bigelow, Chris Holmes and Matthew Carter all made their first Greek types back when things like the triangle form in Helvetica Greek were all the rage. A lot has happened in Greek type design since then. I've recently been collecting samples of various demestica versions of Helvetica from Greece, and have noticed that most of these have rejected the old triangle form in favour of something more acute-like.\n\n"

I only will apologise in advance for saying what I have to in a few sentences only, and hope it does not come across too dogmatic.\n\nI think you are taking \"Modern\" as it applies to the Latin script and imposing it on the Greek script, ignoring typographic interpretations of the script at the time. The Didots' contribution to the development of Greek typeface design is seminal, and very much _not_ in a \"strong vertical stress and absence of pen-written ductus\". If you are not in a hurry, I could send you some images of the real thing in the next few days.\n\nAs it looks on your PDF, the Greek looks like an update of the misguided genre set out by Times Greek in the late fifties. I would be very interested to see what you would come up with if you loosened up your take on the script.

      "content": "Gerry, perhaps it is presumptuous of me to have my own ideas of what a Greek type may be, not being a Greek, but I have studied a wide range of interpretations, including the Didots', and have, as I said, been unable to find a \"modern\" precedent fully suited to match the formal qualities of the mid 19th century modern roman, although Bodoni's Greek of c.1790, which does in fact have a pronounced vertical stress, led me to believe that my direction was not completely anachronistic (GB being more of an inspiration than the Times).\n\nBTW, the italic of Albany will feature the more traditional pen-driven \"Baroque\" (to use Bringhurst's term for 18th century italics of varied stress angle) ductus. This will establish a considerable contrast between the upright and slanted styles, the lack of which is presently IMO a weakness of Greek serifed typography. One of the riches of serifed western type is the stylistic contrast between roman and italic. In fact, many people (although not I) consider slanted roman to be a second-rate form of oblique emphasis, a failed modernist experiment (note Optima Nova Italic). I should point out that different italic forms do exist in the traditional Monotype Greek 90, they are nicely done, but quite subtle. This is also the case with Minion Pro. The ClearType Greek italics have alternate more-cursive forms of beta and theta (although not the curly rho), but are basically stylistically slanted versions of the roman glyphs. So this stiff-arsed Albany roman serves to set up the loose italic, which I'm working on.\n\nI approached the design of this typeface with an eye on history and culture, but also philosophically as a problem in pure design. At its most basic, my design argument is this: if the Roman lower case, derived from pen writing as surely as is the Greek, can exist with or without serifs, why can't the Greek? I'm not taking it to that extreme (yet), but that's the couple-of-tumblers, \"why not?\" logic at back of it.\n\nI'm not concerned that modernizing, or borrowing typographic techniques first invented in the West, is somehow the dreaded Latinizing. After all, if Western concepts like a slanted emphasis style, small caps, and bold face are OK, the cat is out of the bag, ennit? And thanks for the sans.\n\nThere seems to be a confusion in Greek typology between alphabetic form and typeface style. The common typeface during the 20th century was known as \"Plain\", or by its Monotype designation, Greek 90. In the West, a similar situation had existed, prior to the 1890s, after which typefaces began to be known by their designer's name. A sense of historical relativism structured this understanding, and led to an explosion of stylistic diversity, fostered by eclectics such as Morris Benton and Stanley Morison. To categorize those Greek faces which have provided stylistic diversity, such as Times Greek, as \"misguided\", is restrictive. Sure, the Elzevier types, of which Times is an example, aren't considered as posh fonts, but not every typeface has to be an aristocrat. In some circles, ITC Garamond is considered a travesty, but it has proven a successful and useful face, and while some may consider it misguided, it is not wrong in the sense that you are implying a post-ductus Greek lower case is.\n\nTo me, the \"gestural\" quality of the Greek alphabet which underlies the ClearType Greeks is a myth. I don't deny that it has great historical authenticity, and provides a marvelous corporate stylistic consistency, but it is not the only legitimate road forward.\n\nI take it then, that given the \"misguided\" nature of my typeface, an equally misguided vertical tonos would be quite appropriate?\n\n"

I described it this way to Gerry when I was working on Constantia: in terms of increasing cursivity you get\n\nLatin upright -\\> Greek upright -\\> Greek italic -\\> Latin italic\n\nIf you follow what you've characterised as a 'gestural' approach to Greek, you end up with a design that is more cursive than the corresponding Latin. As I've stated elsewhere, I think this is appropriate. The problem then is how to distinguish the italic, other than by slant alone. I think there are things that can be done in the italic itself -- as opposed to pushing the upright to be less cursive --, and I'm quite impressed with what Robert Slimbach has done with the Garamond Premier Pro upright and italic Greeks in this regard.

I feel like the strokes should not be vertical in theMu and that it looks a bit too condensed for the rest of the Greek. Also, the vertical tonos creates too much symmetry for me. It becomes too much part of the glyph below it. This may be because I just am so unaccustomed to seeing it vertical and it might grow on me.  \nI like the modern didone feel! I don't think that the calligraphic model is the only one to be followed in Greek or in any other script. We don't make roman capitals to look like they have been chiseled into marble either.

      "content": "Thanks for the props, Chris -- I'm thinking Albany and Leporello Black would team up nicely in Greek. Care to swap?\n\nI am going to go with the angled tonos, because I've realized that it's an integral part of polytonic (or \"Regular Greek\" as Yannis Haralambous calls it). Also, without spacious leading the vertical tonos melds into descenders on the above line, so an angled tonos allows tighter leading. Doing a separate version for polytonic and monotonic in the same font, as per Adobe Garamond Pro, is a bit of a stretch for me. But I will make the display version monotonic with vertical tonos, what the heck.\n\nAs for the Mu, this goes back to another thread, concerning whether to have Greek caps that are different from the Latin, for better balance between the cases. The sample text I used here is from an online translation lesson (except I changed the Latin name from Carrefour to Morisons), representing a typical piece of commercial writing, a PR release, mixing languages. The situation here would be strange with different Ms for the different languages, as the sound is the same, so that led me to stick with the common glyphs. I hear you, this is an odd Mu, but it is also a bit of a strange M in the original face this revival is based on, so I'm afraid I can't change it (doing a revival makes those decisions for one).\n\n"

As I've said, I don't see any reason for the tonos to differ from the polytonic oxia.

      "content": "To conclusively update my explorations and experiments:\n\n1. The vertical tonos (in monotonic setting) was abandoned, for the primary reason that in an upright font, tightly leaded, such a tonos becomes too easily entangled and confused with the (serifless) descenders of the line above.\n\n2. There are several logical reasons for a vertical tonos, but they are all trumped by the above consideration. Most obviously, the reform movement sought to replace all accents -- left, right, etc -- with a generic accent, so the vertical form (as expressed in the triangle) made sense, being neither sharp nor flat. However, it's worth considering Hungarian, Polish, etc., which have only one direction of accent, acutely angled. A vestige of the written form? Perhaps, but also typographically functional as per point (1) above.\n\n3. The steeply angled tonos in Adobe Greek fonts (Minion, Myriad) is not a problem there, because I do not believe they are designed for tight leading (Utopia -- a \"news\" face -- is much bigger on the body). However, it is a parameter of Albany, the face I'm developing, that it should be able to be set solid with extenders almost touching, and a vertical tonos does not work well in that situation.\n\n4. I found a good source of polytonic text on the Internet (Smyth's Grammar), but it uses the monotonic versions of the tonos-accented characters, rather than the proper polytonic versions. How do I know? Because in fonts such as Minion Pro, the polytonic tonos is angled more vertically, whereas the monotonic version is more like an acute. So, it makes sense to use the same-angled tonos for monotonic and polytonic, rather than create unnecessary sophistication, which may not work in real-world situations like this.\n\n5. Some \"cheating\" of the tonos angle is appropriate in the compound accents.\n\n"

Note also that tonos and oxia share the same combining mark encoding (U+0301, the combining acute accent\\*), which means that any design distinction between the two will simply disappear if fully decomposed normalisation is applied. Since text may be subject to different kinds of normalisation, you have no way of anticipating how the diacritics will be displayed unless you make the tonos and oxia identical.\n\n\\* Note that in a bi-script, Latin and Greek font, it may be necessary to include two forms for U+0301 (and other common combining mark characters), appropriately linked to each script/language using the 'locl' feature. This is one of the reasons why I am shipping a separate SBL Greek font in addition to including Greek support in SBL BibLit, so I can directly encode the combining tonos glyph as U+0301, the combining varia as U+0300, etc., in the former.\n\n"
