  "content": "Hello Typophiles,\n\nI'm designing a book using Maiola as the main typeface. The book is an essay on the nature & purpose of art and an analysis of a few key pieces from different traditions: a Lohan, an ancient Egyptian sculpture, a Vermeer, a Rembrandt, etc. I feel the Czech references in Maiola suit the author and his conversational style. I also think it's a fine typeface.\n\nI'm using Maiola throughout, but for captions, space is limited. I'd like to use a condensed sans, but I'm struggling to find something that really complements Maiola.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nthanks\n\n",
