But now I want to bring it to the fore and see if I can get an accurate explanation -   \n   \n_I've been bouncing the word gothic around in my mind lately and have never been able to reconcile 'gothic' fonts with what my idea of gothic should be. I always want to say gothic when I'm thinking of fonts that look goth-ish(?). Why is that?_   \n   \nWhy is it that whenver I hear the word Gothic in relation to fonts I think of something that's more like a Tuscan?   \n   \nAnyone?\n\n",

They were considered by some to be crude and ugly, compared to traditional serif faces, and so were labeled \"gothic.\" This meaning of gothic is no longer current, of course, but it survives (if memories from my college art history class are correct) in the term \"gothic architecture\"--so called by people in the Renaissance who disliked the older style. Neither has anything in particular to do with the Goths, except that they were considered barbaric by the \"civilized\" Romans whose empire they invaded.\n\n"

      "content": "Actually, I was under the impression that \"Grotesk\" was the label given to the first sans-serif typefaces, the category that includes faces like Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica. Grotesks were basically just Egyptian faces with the serifs lobbed off, and people thought this looked odd (grotesque).   \n   \nGothic faces, on the other hand, derive their appelation from Gothic hand script, which first developed in German (Gothic) Europe. Gothic script diverged from other rounded letterforms, making the sides of all letters (even round letters) straight. Modern Gothic sans serif fonts keep much of the structure of the Gothic hand script, including straight-sided letters. DIN is a good example of a Gothic sans.   \n   \nBecause many sans are Gothic, the term has sometimes been misunderstood to designate all sans typefaces, but this is incorrect.   \n   \nThis is how I understand it. I could be wrong.   \n   \nPaul\n\n"
