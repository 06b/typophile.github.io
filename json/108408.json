  "content": "Hi Typophile,\n\nFirst time posting on the forum so hopefully some of you guys can help me with this one? I am struggling to identify a typeface which has been used throughout the branding of a company I am currently redesigning.\n\nThe typeface is used predominantly in the logo, hopefully when its identified I will be able to see if its commercially available as a web font to use online:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418184858im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_6734.jpg)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated,\n\nThanks,  \nLewis.\n\n",
