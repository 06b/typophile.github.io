The lower case seems to be close to a film type that the Solotype Catalog calls Jewell Script. My notes say this was shown as Piedmont Vertical Condensed in the Photo-Lettering Catalog, but the initials for that typeface are simpler than your samples.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with Lex's call for the serif (at least in something digital). Mrs Eaves SC has the flat-topped 3, and the other attributes seem to match pretty well. The problem is that I don't think Mrs Eaves exists as metal type. So it's based on Baskerville, but I don't see any metal samples that have this '3'.\n\nIs there a technique to make a digital font look like letterpress?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The three different \"Great Ideas\" series from Penguin Books try and get a letterpress effect by stamping the front, however often the embossing and the ink don't align exactly.\n\n"
