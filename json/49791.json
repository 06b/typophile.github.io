Please help me make this one a truly unique and well done logo.\n\nNeltner's lawn service is not a lawn mowing business but they do other up keep such as chemical spraying for greener lawns as described in my logo.\n\nSo far I have worked off of Optima Italic to design the word \"Neltner's\", and have used Myriad Pro for the words, \"LAWN SERVICE\".\n\nI want to learn from you.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110510141759im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Neltner's-lawn-service---Logo_4364.gif)\n\n",

Watch your kerning \"Ne\" and \"ner' \" look too close. To me, the swoosh underneath is extraneous. Zebiz's slightly darker green for \"lawn service\" is much easier to read. Great start, keep it up.\n\n"

That might be all you need - no hose, no nozzle, no grass. If it works, it would be much subtler than what you've got going on right now.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

I do agree however that the font has a strong retro feel, very 1970's.\n\nAs for the spray versions, don't go with any from the C series (2 of them look like Nejtner's). Normally I'm not a big Optima fan, but of your design's I like the ones using that font best. It looks organic, simple, grass like (hate the apostrophe though). The nozzle issue has never been resolved. Since you client specifically asked for a spray version, I believe B is the strongest.\n\n"
