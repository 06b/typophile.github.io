  "content": "Hey there!\n\nI'm curious what typeface BlackBerry was using in their recent launch event. I've attached a picture and am linking to several more.\n\nI tried to google it, but it didn't really help, since most of the results deal with the logotype. I also came across a brand identity guideline pdf, but it was from 2007 and apparently they have changed the typeface they are using since then.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!\n\n[1](http://web.archive.org/web/20130830192603/http:/rimblogs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/super-nova-rehearsalfootage2-still002.jpg?w=600&h=338)  \n [2](http://web.archive.org/web/20130830192603/http:/cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_2411.jpg)  \n [3](http://web.archive.org/web/20130830192603/http:/i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/extra/MOBILE/Evenimente/BlackBerry_10/4.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130830192603im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bb10hedimgnolongerrim_3660.jpg)\n\n",
