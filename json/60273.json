The inspiration comes from ornate initials seen in many typographic executions from the middle ages.\n\nCan anyone suggest a font that has these or perhaps another resource where I can find these letters.\n\nI attach a jpeg of what I mean.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ornate1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201035133/http:/typophile.com/files/ornate1.jpg) | 14.12 KB |\n\n",
