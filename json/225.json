Exciting.   \n   \nAs for font management I have always used Suitcase from the   \nbeginning and have little hands on with Font Reserve.   \n   \nCurrently, I am up to Suitcase 10 which is built for OS X but if   \nsomething works better I would like to know.   \n   \nWhat would you recommend for a font management program   \nand why? What is best for X?\n\n",

(In OS X, you can keep fonts in   \nfolders within the Fonts folder.) Most apps will update their   \nfont menus automatically. For those that don't, just quit   \nthe app and start it up again. When I'm done using a font, I   \njust put it in the Trash (I still have the original with the rest   \nof my collection).   \n   \nIf you rely on auto-activation or use Classic a lot, this may   \nnot be for you, but it has a kind of elegant simplicity that   \nappeals to me.\n\n"

On a semi-related note, I've always wondered why something like font management, which seems fairly close to the OS level, shouldn't be included with the OS. I appreciate competition with regard to software, but part of me thinks Apple could do a dandy job if it would include some sort of font management utility built into the OS.\n\n"

      "content": "I've just disabled FontReserve, and downloaded and installed a Trial version of FontAgent Pro. It's pretty slick, but there are a couple of drawbacks I see so far. First, it's slows up launching and shutting down, since it has to do some database management thing that FontReserve never did. Second, libraries and sets are a little confusing, but I think once you get used to the difference, it's probably a powerful feature. Third: you have to keep the program running, apparently, all the time; FontReserve is \"transparent.\" Fourth: when a font is auto-activated in FontReserve, you can tell it's active because it has \"active status\" in the program window; with FontAgent, an auto-activated font does not show up as active, which is kind of weird. Fifth, the auto-activation in Photoshop is, by the company's admission, buggy, but they claim it will be better with Photoshop 8 (!). I should send this list of concerns to them. Positives: intuitive, cocoa platform and interface; font player is excellent; wysiwyg menus are very helpful; customizable specimen sheet was something I always wanted in FontReserve but never got (you can customize type color and background color as well!); a tiny download; easy to set up and use.\n\n"
