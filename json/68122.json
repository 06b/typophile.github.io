  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is my first post and I hope it's in the right place. I am trying to identify the typefaces used in \"The Sun\" (NYC: 1835-196), the daily newspaper in which \"Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus\" first appeared in 1897. I am specifically looking for the body and headlines....school project here at [California College of the Arts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013145005/http:/www.cca.edu/).\n\nHere is an example a standard page, as preserved by Chronicling America:  \n [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1904-11-27/ed-1/seq-23.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013145005/http:/chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1904-11-27/ed-1/seq-23.pdf)\n\nAn explanatory article of the \"new\" Sun's typography  \n [http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/new\\_york\\_new\\_york/typography\\_in\\_the\\_sun.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013145005/http:/www.themorningnews.org/archives/new_york_new_york/typography_in_the_sun.php)\n\nAnd the wiki article about the paper:  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Sun\\_(New\\_York)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013145005/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(New_York))\n\nThe body text to be close to Bookman Oldstyle or even Clarendon, but I am TOTALLY stumped on the headlines.\n\nThanks everyone!  \nMax\n\n",

These are old metal typefaces and I don't know if there are digital versions. I can't tell what the body text face is, but it's some sort of newspaper face (something like Ionic, but older).\n\n"
