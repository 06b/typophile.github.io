I started from a .ttf file and saved as Type 1 (Set as bitstream). My modifications worked fine but when I print, some letters seem to have thickened a little (u, r, and n especially.)   \n   \nThere is no such change on screen, only when I print it (using an inkjet printer). What could cause this? Is there another way to save that will keep it from doing this? Is it a matter of bitmaps or something?   \n   \nI'm not really used to FontLab yet and font editing software overall so detailed explanations would be very nice! =)\n\n",

      "content": "Probably the hinting is being thrown off (especially since you're switching from TT to T1). Hints are \"extra\" instructions embedded in fonts to help them render more consistently in low resolutions\\*. It's something you can tweak yourself, but it's a lot of work to do right. On the other hand, it's possible that Fontlab's auto-hinting will do a decent job for you. Your best bet is to keep the font as TT, and possibly tweak the hinting just for the characters you're modifying.   \n   \n\\* Normally this affects screen rendering most, but for smaller point sizes even laser printers can exhibit funny artefacts.   \n   \nThe other possibility I can think of is a counter direction issue. Contours that are turning the wrong way will render slightly darker - although I'm not sure why only some of your glyphs would exhibit the problem. Also, proper contour direction for TT is opposite that of T1! You can check everything manually: T1 contours have to be counter-clockwise for black bodies, and clockwise for white (like the inside of the \"o\"); or you can use FontLab's automatic process.   \n   \nBTW, I think Courier New is covered by the MS font EULA, which prohibits font modifications of any kind, even if it's just for \"internal\" use. But I personally recommend ignoring such clauses in EULAs, although I might advise you not to publicize it too much. :-)   \n   \nBonne chance...   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I'm willing to consider arguments of this kind regarding retail font licenses, because there is room for debate in what is 'normal' for such licenses, but core system fonts are a different kind of thing, developed, paid for and provided to users under a completely different model from retail fonts.\n\n"

What are the main differences between T1 and TT?   \n   \nI've had similar problems with a font I started creating, on screen it appeared nicely but printed on inkjet and even a bit on laser some shapes were a lot thicker than I had made them. I had created it in illustrator and then imported to fontographer.   \n   \nWould this be because fontographer might have a worse hinting engine than Fontlab's? Any tips on how to import my font from fontographer to fontlab?   \n   \nI'm going to start another thread about EULA in release, sounds to me like interesting stuff.\n\n"

How is it handled?_   \n   \nHinting affects pixel sizes (measured in ppem, i.e. pixels per em), not point sizes, so fractional point values are handled exactly the same way as full point values. The rasteriser calculates the relationship of point size and resolution to determine ppem size. At low resolutions, there may be no visible difference between close point values, e.g. 6pt and 6.25 points, since ppem sizes are whole numbers so the rasteriser always rounds to the nearest ppem size.\n\n"

Chances are they won't go back to the person who modified the font.   \n   \nCheers, Si\n\n"
