I don’t remember seeing an announcement for it or a plug to kick it off so I thought, hey! let’s take this puppy for a spin! So I did! so hey! Tell us about it, Joe? Let’s not keep it a secret!

And, if it’s a true obsession, you can show it with a larger donation of $100.\n\nYou’ll receive a badge to add to your user icon. Let other users know of your undying sympathy (shield), love (heart) obsession (drop of blood) for Typophile.\n\n**[You can contribute here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905212818/http:/typophile.com/ad/redirect/39853/) —\\>**\n\nAlso, if you purchased a tee, or buttons, or came to our SF Film Fest in the last 12 months check your inbox for your badge to match your contribution. (Some of you made other significant contributions this year and you haven’t been forgotten.)\n\n"
