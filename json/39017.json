Schnelle has compiled a [great list of (metal) Blackletter faces](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202185215/http:/www.beepworld.de/members66/vau-ef-be/schriftliste1.htm); at first glance I couldn’t spot anything close. Then, a lot of the faces lack images. For some of them, one could find samples via searching for their names in the [Global Type database](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202185215/http:/www.global-type.org/Searching.743.0.html).\n\nAnd yes, it definitely says ‘Kickapo **d** ’ – if you compare it to other gothic faces like [Fleischmann-Gotisch](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202185215/http:/www.preusstype.com/fleischmann.php).\n\n"

Either way, it all of sudden has some pretty funny mystery and/or lore attatched to it.\n\nOr, it really was the Kickapod Scout. And if that’s the case, I’m going to suggest they change the name of the paper to the Kickapod Crane. There are a few cranes around here.\n\n"
