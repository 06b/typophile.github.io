Not some textbook on European history, but rather an adventure-story that happens to take place in an historical setting (somewhat like C.S. Foresters \"Hornblower\").   \n   \nI've looked at what feels like a million possible fonts, and of those I've checked out so far I'm leaning towards Adobe Jenson Pro. Maybe.   \n   \nAny other suggestions would be much appreciated.   \n   \nBjorn\n\n",

      "content": "Jenson was the man (Aldus was a poser), and most Jensons (except those with large x-heights) are wonderful, especially for book work. But:   \n1) You want something that amplifies the topic, and a Jenson seems too Italian Renaissance here.   \n2) What makes a font [nominally] good for a book is mostly technical, like proper vertical proportions - and a bunch of fonts have what it takes, so the one you choose should have a good reason to be used. What's Jenson's?   \n   \nMy first choice would actually be something with blackletter overtones, but it's hard to:   \n1) Find one subtle enough to really work. This is actually something on my back-burner (actually my battery of back-burners).   \n2) Get publishers to accept such a choice.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

For one thing, Kis's stuff is certainly Dutch-looking (I mean the style that Caslon sprung from), and that's because he went to the Netherlands (from Hungary) to study under the leading Dutch master, Voskens (who only agreed to teach him because he knew Kis would be going back home at the end).   \n   \n\\> Bitstream Kis   \n   \nIf you look at the stuff on Myfonts\\* you'll see that the Bitstream cut is frankly the least suitable here... :-(   \nIt lacks the sharpness and narrowness that I think makes Ehrhard promising.

I understand that when typesetting novels, it's mostly about the time and style in which they were written, but what to do when it comes to science/math/physics etc.? Is there a reading on \"how to choose the right typeface for a book\" topic or the only way to understand it is by collecting knowledge scraps from you folks?\n\n"

As I understand it the style of the Ehrhardt font hails from mid-17th century Netherlands, yes? That's practically a perfect fit, so a Kis of some kind would be the way to go.   \n   \nIs the Ehrhardt particularly superior in some way, though?
