Mostly low level desktop publishing and some basic web design services.\n\nAny feedback would be great.\n\nThe website that it will eventually belong to is also being redesigned.  \n [This thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107205105/http:/typophile.com/node/21296) has discussion and screenshots related to that.\n\nCheers - JonnySchneider\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107205105im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_001_5398.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_001.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107205105/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_001.gif) | 5.67 KB |\n| [logo\\_002.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107205105/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_002.jpg) | 15.99 KB |\n| [logo\\_03.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107205105/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_03.gif) | 5.11 KB |\n| [logo\\_04.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107205105/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_04.gif) | 2.82 KB |\n\n",

It's obviously not succeeded as a legible mark since you guys havent recognised it right away.\n\nPerhaps i'd be better off with an ambiguous mark?\n\nI'll do some more work and post some revisions. I've got limited time to get this done though and so far its taking a very long time.\n\n"

Tried to make the mark legibly read 839. This is pretty sketchy. Not sure if the idea is worth developing.  \n**version 3:**\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107205105im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_03_3799.gif)\n\nHere's another direction. I think the idea is okay, but it looks a bit conservative for it's purpose. The mark can be read as \"ETN\" It might be a bit subtle?  \n**version 4:**\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107205105im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_04_4230.gif)\n\n"

Version 2 looks too much like a shamrock (esp. since it's green), which I guess could work if you wanted to emphasize your Irish / Bostonian roots.\n\nI say stick with version 3, refine it a bit more, and do something different with the type.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

      "content": "thats a really good idea. that way the top and bottom of the mark will be flat and three will definitely read as three, instead of maybe being an eight.\n\nThis idea was originally inspired by the cool shapes of triline type for Mexico Olypics in '68. I saw it in a book recently bought and like the way it looks.\n\nThanks for the idea Tim. I'll work on it...\n\n"
