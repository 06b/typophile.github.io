I've come across likely candidates (Trade Gothic Extended, Aviano Sans, Doublewide) but none of those have the exact letterforms, especially the sharp point angles of capital M and W. The letterforms have the sharp angle characteristics of Metro sans (Dwiggins) but in an exaggerated extended way. The news channel graphics have shown this in upper and lowercase, while the SAG awards used all caps.
