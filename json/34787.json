  "content": "I had chosen Sovereign as the typeface for a logo I’m designing for a modern, slightly indian themed gift shop. The problem is when using small caps, the typeface looses it’s unique calligraphic style. Does anyone have a recommendation for a similar (or not) typeface that maintains a unique quality in small caps, although I guess small caps are not mandatory if someone has another great suggestion. Also, I plan on using the type on a slight arc. Thanks so much.\n\n [‹ Jan Tschichold Book Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007162059/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33545 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Blippo Black Font Needed in Russian/Cryillic !!! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007162059/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34704 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
