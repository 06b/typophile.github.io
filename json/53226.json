I think most of what you are showing here is custom. A nice contemporary monoline script is needed in my opinion.\n\n"

But the two on the right are really unique. Closest I can think of is [Chamber Sans Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321004928/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_chambers_sans_ot/) with ligatures, you might get close.\n\n"
