      "content": "Great suggestion (as usual) by Kevin with Sisco, probably the best ready-to-go option. But I don't think it's the one. Mainly because of /R (over-)extended leg and even if it means customization, I'd rather think it's [Klavika](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415000500/http:/processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika). Some details are off (but easily customized) like crossbar-less /G and /Y fork position. Klavika is actually used all over their identity from graphics to print materials and packaging. They also use [Titilium](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415000500/http:/www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Titillium) for their [online identity](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415000500/http:/www.thegrayl.com/), also similar to Klavika.  \nA better look to their logo (from this [PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415000500/http:/static1.squarespace.com/static/52a101f6e4b0ddb9096493f1/t/545ad15fe4b042d9849e64be/1415237983158/20141103_GRAYL_CUP_MANUAL_v1r6.pdf))\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415000500im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_5125.png)\n\n"
