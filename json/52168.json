      "content": "Optical margin alignment cannot be set in paragraph styles (even though it is applied at the paragraph level!). This is a symptom of Adobe’s broken development methodology: add new features, advertise them, and then forget about them. It’s a real shame that the Indesign team has allowed this feature to wither as the only option int a menu item that isn’t even relevant in the Latin version of Indesign, because with a little polish it would be so useful! [I recommend that you file a feature request to move optimal margin alignment to the paragraph settings, along with the addition of control over what does and doesn’t hang.](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216005426/http:/www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform)\n\n"
