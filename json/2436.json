It's a relativley simple sans, but the \"n\" is a bit unique in that it doesn't have a \"tail\" (sorry, not sure of the correct term) on it's left side. It's effectivley an upside-down \"u\".   \n   \nThanks in advance! ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826032624im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nJeff Croft   \nhttp;//jeffcroft.com ![Burton Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826032624im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22522.jpg)\n\n",
