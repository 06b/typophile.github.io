It'll be a monoface.   \n   \nI think I like the way the stroke of the 'r' ends and I'll probably make the 'g' 'm' & 'n'look and feel like the 'r'.   \n   \nThe 'y' is rough, i'm having problems with it.   \n   \nI do realize this name is probably taken, but i like it.   \n   \n ![intentional](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031708im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8430.jpg)\n\n",
