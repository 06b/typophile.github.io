There’s a point where a line is crossed—for example, going in and poking around through someone’s Opentype code, or saving it as a VFB for whatever reason, but I don’t think that just looking at the letters crosses that line.\n\n"

I never resave, adjust or make any changes to any designer's fonts. The legal implications aside, that's the respect they deserve at a minimum.\n\nI don't want to adjust other people's fonts, I want to learn from them.  \nI have a special folder of completed various fonts I've collected so I can use as a constant reference, from the widely spread Arial & Helvetica, to display fonts, old fonts, and through to grunge and ultra modern.\n\nIn my early days as a Graphic Designer I've pulled apart Graphic Design Companies free Clip Art to see how they did gradients, patterns and any other tricks I valued.\n\nMy rule is to learn from the best and build new stuff using any skills or techniques you can grab from them.\n\nYou can't create in a vacuum.  \nTake it all in. It's there to be learnt from.  \nYou won't be a newbie for long.  \nCheers\n\n"
