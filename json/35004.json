  "content": "Hi all\n\nI’ve been working on italic version of a sans fonts and using the method described here to correct the curve shape\n\n[http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.34.curves.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907035024/http:/briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.34.curves.htm \"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.34.curves.htm\")\n\nThis method shows really good results for glyphs such as O,S,C,D etc. but with glyphs like P, R and B the results aren’t as good. Does anyone have any advise on this matter or know of other methods to help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907035024im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/P_5462.gif)\n\n [‹ Ann: FontLab Studio 5.0.4 released](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907035024/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35006 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [FontLab Type 1 hinting preview, \"Adobe\" preview unavailable? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907035024/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34995 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "IMO you have to develop an eye (and hand) for tweaking these curves manually.  \nOne method is to mechanically slant your roman type, then put a similar glyph from Helvetica, Futura, whatever, in the mask layer, and see how your BCPs and handles have to be moved to get correspondence.  \nNote in particular that the extrema “slant line” in many faces differs for curved and straight letters, and may even vary between O and S.  \nLooking at the shapes sideways, upside down, and back to front also helps.\n\n"
