However, my knowledge is still incredibly limited, so I was wondering if anyone could offer some suggestions regarding a font for a logo.\n\nThe company is called ’exocet’ and is to be depicted in lowercase characters, and I want to be able to use a font that somehow resembles or evokes the same kind of feeling as the typefaces used in old penguin books, and the like.\n\nSo: a serif font that’s not too clean and tidy, and could translate well enough at various sizes. The only thing I’ve come across that’s close, as an example, is [Milton MN Demi Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20080922015109/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/milton/). I know it’s not one that would’ve been used as body, but it’s just an idea as to the sort of thing that i’m after.\n\nDoes this even make any sense?\n\nHope it does...\n\n [‹ Between American Typewriter and Rockwell](http://web.archive.org/web/20080922015109/http:/typophile.com/node/49565 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Is there such thing as an ascending ch ligature? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080922015109/http:/typophile.com/node/49656 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
