Besides the option to edit the tables, it currently has for instance a couple of viewers (font, glyph, embedded bitmap and GPOS/GSUB), a consistency checker and a tool to copy glyphs.\n\nAt the moment OTTED is in use at URW++ and the Dutch Type Library and it will be offered via the DTL FontMaster web site shortly.\n\n"
