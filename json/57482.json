      "content": "In the 1960s you would have often heard the names Hermann Zapf and Adrian Frutiger, though the types that made them famous were designed a decade earlier. Jan Tschichold designed Sabon in the mid-60s, late in his career. Matthew Carter designed Cascade Script and Snell Roundhand in the 60s, though he didn't become well-known until the 70s. Herb Lubalin designed Avant Garde for the magazine of the same name in the 60s, and the prolific Ed Benguiat was designing in the 60s, though his designs didn't gain widespread popularity until the 70s.  \nGraphic designers of that period, admired for their use of type designed by others, included Paul Rand and Milton Glaser.\n\n"
