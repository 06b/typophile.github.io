  "content": "Hi everyone, I too am looking for information on Univers... I’m looking for quotes from well known designers about Univers, both positive and negative and comparing it to other fonts. I would particularly love info about specific letters. For instance in the 1957 version the ampersand is pretty hideous but in the later linotype version it has been changed into the more traditional & style...  \nCan anyone help? Thank you so much!\n\n [‹ Klavika, Headline Font.

It seems to have a better feel all around, warmer in the way a tube amplifier compares to a transistor amplifier.\n\nAnyway, as for getting quotes, dig through Swiss design books starting with the early 1960s. Univers was not all available in 1957, it took a few years for Deberny & Peignot and Monotype to get all the weights drawn, printers to buy it, and people to start using it.\n\n"
