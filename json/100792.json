  "content": "Hello everyone! I am a new one!  \ncan someone give me some advice ?  \nI am writing an academic paper about typography and mass media. This theme also includes all information about typefaces. I have aldeady read a book, by Robert Bringhurst, but I would like to go further on this issue. So I found three books, those ones:\n\n[http://www.amazon.com/Just-My-Type-About-Fonts/dp/1592406521/ref=cm\\_cmu\\_...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317141222/http:/www.amazon.com/Just-My-Type-About-Fonts/dp/1592406521/ref=cm_cmu_pg__header \"http://www.amazon.com/Just-My-Type-About-Fonts/dp/1592406521/ref=cm\\_cmu\\_pg\\_\\_header\")\n\n[http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/r...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317141222/http:/www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/ref=pd_sim_b_2 \"http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/ref=pd\\_sim\\_b\\_2\")\n\n[http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Typeface-Alexander-S-Lawson/dp/B005MWKQQ4](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317141222/http:/www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Typeface-Alexander-S-Lawson/dp/B005MWKQQ4 \"http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Typeface-Alexander-S-Lawson/dp/B005MWKQQ4\")\n\n,but I haven't choosen yet which one is more appropriate to give me more details about the uses of typefaces. Has anybody know those books?\n\n",

(But I plan to at some point.)\n\nOf these three, 'Thinking With Type' would give you more details about the uses of typefaces. I think ' [Shaping Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317141222/http:/www.amazon.com/Shaping-Text-Type-Typography-Reader/dp/9063692234/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1361638565&sr=1-1&keywords=Shaping+Text)' is an even better introductory text.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
