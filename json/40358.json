And I’m not sure if he was involved or not or whatever happened to him.\n\nBut in his short period of influence he changed us all.

      "content": "Hey all, I just got here from a Google search. I used to know Andy in middle school and for a year in high school before I was kicked out. Here’s what I know:\n\n1. He was sort of a spaz in middle school. (not that I had a better reputation) He was sort of an over-active, pull girls’ pigtails, don’t-quite-fit-in type. When I found Lines & Splines I was amazed at how mature and brilliant his writing was compared to how I remembered him acting in person most of the time.\n\n2. He grew up in Bethesda, MD.\n\n3. He and I were in a group of probably less than 10 people on BBSes in Pyle Middle school in 1991. I remember asking him if he had a “Focke’s List” for that month and when he realized I was a BBSer, he got really serious and intense. He asked if I was on any “elite BBSes” but I didn’t yet know what those were. I lamely replied that I was an The Elite Few, which was a policy/politics debate BBS in Washington DC. It was like being asked your favorite action movie and saying “I only watch PBS.” He was not impressed, but later I think we shared some BBS numbers with each other. It was strange seeing him talk about computers because he went from low on the totem pole socially to having a commanding presence. He wasn’t a spaz when he talked about computers.\n\n4. When Lines and Splines became the most respected blog on the planet (I remember thinking he was late to the game but it just didn’t matter because he was so amazing) I wrote him an email telling him we went to middle school together. He wrote right back. When I explained who I was, he stopped writing.\n\nI don’t expect to see him make his presence known in the same way again. Maybe he’ll write a book.\n\n"
