      "content": "An sfnt font (TTF, OTF) can have an em square of any size. There is a gain in performance speed if the em square is a power of 2, hence 2048 being the most common standard, but this is not a requirement of the specification. Note, however, that some customers, e.g. Microsoft, make a power of 2 a procurement requirement because of the performance gain. From what I understand, this performance gain is pretty small, but MS consider it significant enough to be desirable.\n\n"

      "content": "\\<font class=\"dontLookLikeCrap\"\\>This is one of those cases where an ancient issue has become almost religious belief.   \n   \nAdobe's testing has never shown any performance difference based on an em square being a power of 2. I've never seen Microsoft point to any testing that demonstrated it such a performance difference, despite being asked.   \n   \nThe original expectation (and likely reality) of a performance difference for TrueType outlines was specific to the 68K Motorola series of processors, and byte-shifting operation optimization within those processors. This rationale does not transfer to PowerPC or Intel processors.   \n   \nAlso, I've never seen a claimed performance difference for PostScript outlines, though it would seem to be just as probable (or improbable today).   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\\</font\\>\n\n"
