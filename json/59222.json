  "content": "When are we going to have access to computer displays with pixel densities even beginning to approach print, say 300 pixels per inch? Although mobile devices boast higher resolutions, I don't remember seeing significant improvement in the pixel densities of computer displays for several years.\n\nI would dearly love to have even a tiny little 4-inch display as long as it has a high pixel density, that I can use as a secondary monitor to aid in the type design process. Is something like this possible with devices that are currently available on the market? When will such displays be available, or do manufacturers have no plans to improve the resolutions of displays for the average consumer?\n\n",

In fact, the original [IBM T220](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019132138/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T221) came out in 2001. I've been predicting it would happen sooner, or at least wanting it, for a while.\n\nIf you want a small display, though, you can get a Nokia 810 (I have an 800, which is nice).\n\nI do think it is inevitable at some point. The incremental cost is going down and down as compute power goes up, and the increase in quality would be dramatic. For a while I was expecting Apple to do it, as it would be a way to really differentiate their product line from what's available in the PC world, but currently their PC business model seems to be all about packaging completely commodity parts at premium prices.\n\nThe next challenge is to get Web graphics to work at higher resolutions. Bitmaps on the web are (more or less) locked at 96dpi. Of course, there's always SVG and so on, but at current trends it will be a while until most browsers actually support it.\n\nExcept in some applications, I actually suspect 200dpi is adequate, because you can make the antialiasing really good on displays. In print, you need higher resolution because antialiasing is either difficult or impossible (there's essentially no control over gamma curves). By my calculations, ordinary text at 200dpi has about 95% of the contrast as it would on an infinite-resolution display, even without doing stuff like ClearType. At some point, people may decide that going for that extra 5% is also worth it, but I'd be plenty happy just to get the 200dpi any time soon.\n\nIt's going to make a huge difference for type on the screen.\n\n"

The IBM T220 sounds like a monster!\n\nSo we've got resolution-dependent OSs and web graphics that lock us into the current resolutions and will make any substantial improvement in the density a bit of a hassle. Add the fact that manufacturers have been sitting on the technology for years, that the current trend in consumer technology has swung toward getting the same features cheaper rather than improving features and adding to the price, and I'm getting worried about the inertia. Reading discussions about the merits of different antialiasing technologies, I wonder whether such debates wouldn't be rendered obsolete if the resolution of displays simply improved. And of course, I would have less cause to worry about learning TrueType hinting...\n\nReally, I think I'd be happy to get my hands on a 200 ppi monitor by 2015. I'll be following James's advice until then.\n\n"

In the last few years we’ve really reached the practical size limits for desktop monitors, and LCD adoption has locked refresh rates at 60Hz without complaints. Good 30\" screens are affordable at consumer and professional price points, and most people don’t have the need or a desk big enough for anything larger. It won’t be long before the relationship of price to size or image quality is irrelevant to consumers in developed nations, so resolution will really be the best feature to sell displays with and inertia will be a non-issue.\n\n"

The problem is that when we want to evaluate text quality, we typically get closer to the screen. But any screen becomes a high density screen from a far enough distance.\n\nI'm pessimistic that screen resolutions are going to get drastically better by 2015. LCD pixels are inefficient at letting the light from the backlight through, and smaller pixels are much less efficient. Backlights are already the single biggest power users on laptops. Many consumers are asking computer manufacturers for longer battery life and fewer are asking for higher pixel density. I think we're going to see battery life increase to a full day's use first.\n\n"

The interface has to be re-designed to be scalable, so that an increase in resolution doesn't lead to tiny unreadable menus. Replacing the bitmap-based OS interfaces with vector-based ones probably won't be a trivial matter. And it's not just OS interfaces.

With res-independent UI there are only two factors to speak about:  \n-- resolution-independent UI with elements measured in mm, inch, etc.\\*\\*  \n-- scaling of this UI including the mouse arrow, FLS5 nodes, etc.  \nThe hardware driver would tell OS and apps about its size (mm, inch) and resolution (dpmm, dpi).\n\nHow to deal with old pixel-based apps is another question. Maybe present them in special red-flagged windows (\"Legacy! Update or forget!\") that scale content or not, depending on user preferences.\n\n\\* Here, MS blog, Bill Hill's blog. Resolution-independence per se does not look like a big issue. Not for type designers who are used to think in abstract units (per em). Many contributions try hard to defend the status quo by complicating matters, mixing res-independent and pixel-based approaches, presenting calculations from pixels to display size to resolution and back to pixels.  \nNot sure about the UI in total but [this how-to](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019132138/http:/wiki.laptop.org/go/Making_Sugar_icons) for making icons for OLPC's Sugar shows that it is possible.\n\n\\*\\* Ideally, this was something as abstract as fonts' UPM, yet I think it is fine to starting from a real-world size that at the same time indicates what the designer considered ideal at normal viewing distance.
