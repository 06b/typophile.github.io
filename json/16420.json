  "content": "Hi everyone.\n\nAs you are more and more becoming my family,  \ni thought i'd ask you for advice...\n\nI am doing this school prject,  \nwhere designing a corporate identity program  \nfor a fitness center and fitness program,...  \nwhich it's name unfortunatly I can not tell... : (\n\nTo make a long story short, my logo is mostly done i am happy with it,  \nand the name for the logo-type, after strong thought, is set in Avant Garde lowercase...( i personally dislike its \"s\")  \nbut because I lack of any other good fresh examples, for a geometric sans serif, and of using futura... I'm not sure. ; /\n\n- Other geometric sans serifs?\n\nEven If I consider leaving the logotype set in lowercase avant garde, or other geometric sans,  \nI still need to find a good strong corporate font that would work well for most usage,  \nthis is probably stationary at body copy sizes, display and even big headlines.  \nI feel it has to be a dynamic, versatile, fresh and hype,  \n(I know someone is going to blame me for this last word),  \nmore femenine oriented than for example HTF Knockout which i was considering,...\n\nHope this does not sound like nonsense  \nAny suggestions are very welcomed as I belive  \nthis can help me learn more and help my project.  \nI will certanly be glad to lisecence for my personal use the chosen font...  \n(most likely in OpenType format)\n\nThanks. once more.\n\nGiovanni\n\n",
