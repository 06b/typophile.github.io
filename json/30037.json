  "content": "I was searching for an Opentype version of Today Sans Serif on google and came across a link for a cheapy font package for $19.95 that contained a few well known fonts that a single weight sell for much more. What is weird is that in the description for the font, they list that they have permission from the foundry/designer. One was Eagle by Font Bureau and another was Coquette by Mark Simonson. I don’t want to post a link, lest it is an illegal package, but I’ll use oh-so-clever type code: the name is not “descender” but rather “\\_\\_cender”.\n\nSo, what’s the story?\n\n [‹ Where does \"pica\" come from ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224133336/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29989 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Print Services ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224133336/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30046 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
