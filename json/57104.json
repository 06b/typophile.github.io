      "content": "hi jeff,\n\nthe font is ATSackers Gothic. allan haley at monotype told me it was developed for one of the photo lettering systems expressly for thermography which was invented to replicate engraving. monotype digitized it in the, i think, late 80s. Sackers was the collection of engraving lettering styles that the cold type version came from.\n\ni had a great time in st. louis, thank you. the great poster you guys created for me is somewhere in this blog and or my wordpress blog.\n\n[http://nancysharoncollinsstationer.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/design-giants/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100524222825/http:/nancysharoncollinsstationer.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/design-giants/ \"http://nancysharoncollinsstationer.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/design-giants/\")\n\nhi james,\n\nthanks for the tip about indexhibit. updating the site is not so much a bother as it requires me to use a portion of my brain that is not my usual pattern, so its a good exercise for me. the site has a CMS section where i just update the words with some tagging or coding (or whatever those little things are like \\<\\> and etc.,) its just more fastidious work than i like to do more than 2-4 times a year.\n\nit did inspire me to start loading-up the aiga new orleans history and sustainability pages, though.\n\nthink i'll try-put the indexhibit thing for my husband's site.\n\nhi AGL,\n\nthe plate is copper. funny, i even upped the red and magenta on the original file to make sure it read as copper and not something else. oh well, each monitor is so different...\n\n"
