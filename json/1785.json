  "content": "Greetings from the AIGA conference. (I chose wrong this year, but I'm trying to make the best of it.) Is anyone else here at the conference?   \n   \nI attended a seminar on OpenType by two Adobe Toronto guys. They were good at their jobs, which was clearly to be cheerleaders for the CS suite -- showing off the admittedly dazzling combo of InDesign and OpenType Pro fonts. Two peeves, however:   \n   \n1) They started off with a general presentation (done in Acrobat) in which all the quotation marks were actually inch marks. Way to boost your credibility, guys.   \n   \n2) During Q&A, they pretty much tap-danced around anything potentially negative about the new Creative Suite model. I realize their job is to evangelize, but when you can't even get a straight answer out of them I don't think it helps Adobe any. F'rinstance, I asked about the _next_ round of upgrades: if you purchase the Suite now, are you locked into always upgrading the whole Suite rather than individual apps? Their answer boiled down to, \"Yes, because that's the way you want it, and you'd be a dolt to want anything else.\" Sigh. Someone else asked about the (current) Photoshop-owner upgrade, and whether there were better upgrade options for people who own more than one Adobe app. Again, their answer was basically, \"But why would you want such a crazy thing?\" The guy who asked the question actually had to follow up with: \"So... are you saying no?\"   \n   \nI know it's hard to be in the position of marketing something that's problematic. But maybe they could take a page from Tim Cole, who's the only evangelist-type I've ever heard actually give straight, no-nonsense answers. It sure made one want to hear and believe what he had to say. Speaking Marketese doesn't fool anyone.   \n   \nIMHO, of course.\n\n",

The fact that a and s have different kinds of terminals from everything else is not unusual; these letters are often exceptional because their terminals are not strictly speaking serifs. The fact that some letters have ball terminals is also not unusual (see Fenway, Arnhem, Paradox, to name just a few recent designs). So let's focus on the adnate vs. non adnate wedges, considering the uppercase L. This is a letter in which the terminal needs to be heavier than a typical serif, both because it is vertical and because it is so far distant from the main stem, connected only by a thin stroke. The connection of the terminal to that thin stroke benefits from being strengthened, hence the adnate connection, which adds weight and makes the terminal a terminal, _i.e._ something that belongs to the stroke, and not merely something stuck on the end. For comparison, take a look at how Matthew Carter solves the same problem in a different way in Fenway.   \n   \n[PS. Shouldn't this be a separate thread?]\n\n"

Maybe your view of what is orthodox is simply too limited?   \n   \nI have not looked closely at the new Fenway cut, but I've looked very closely at the original, having used it in _Language Culture Type_ and all the ATypI Vancouver material. Take a look at the L and see how Matthew maintains the regularity of his abrupt serif connection but at the same time links the wedge to the stroke. He is solving the same problem that Jonathan is solving in a different way. I don't have a problem with either solution, and if anything Jonathan's is the more orthodox and less innovative.\n\n"

(I hope you thoroughly enjoyed AIGA and Vancouver.)   \n   \nHrant, I confess that I'm not entirely sure exactly what you keep carping on about with Mercury's terminals nor what you mean by 'free-willed'. But take another look at all that's going on in Galliard:   \n ![Galliard Terminals](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141121im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19262.gif)   \n   \nYou've got a 'lachrymal' terminal in the 'c', but the 'r' becomes more of a beak, while the 'a' has a logic all its own, none of which is similar to the serif-like terminal on the 's'. And what about that 'a' tail compared to the rest of the foot serifs or the 'd' tail serif? Plus, of course, the broad triangular head serifs compared with the thin foot serifs.   \n   \nOr what about Monticello:   \n ![Monticello Terminals](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141121im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19263.gif)   \n   \nThe head serifs are all over the place -- compare the 'b' to the 'd' and the 'r' to the 'i'. Don't ask me what's going on with that 's' terminal. And I didn't bother to show the huge, broadly bracketed serifs of the caps. How did Binny (and Griffith/Larson and Carter) get away with it?   \n   \nThe tension between _harmony_ and _contrast_ is present in all good form-making. You find it in painting, sculpture, architecture, and music, as well. Of course, one generation's (or person's) contrast is another's discord. I'm not surprised to see this in Mercury, as it was inspired by Fleischmann and this kind of extreme combination of contrasting elements was part of the zeitgeist of the late Baroque period.   \n   \nSpeaking of abrupt vs. adnate, I'm surprised John didn't mention Fenway's 'v' with its remarkable juxtaposition of serifs -- straightline abrupt, curved abrupt, and fully adnate.   \n   \n ![Fenway 'v'](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141121im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19264.gif)   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

Sadly, I missed most of the early morning sessions (and 6AM yoga) due to, shall we say, a rather zealous dedication to after hours socializing.   \n   \nAll in all the conference was an inspiring and worthwhile experience, and one which I would recommend. If you did the math in paragraph one, you'll know that I attended about 24 lectures. What is remarkable is that of them only one, Jonathon Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones, showed any actual work. To many this was a disappointment, but I found it uniquely envigorating to hear designers really TALK for a change. Yes, a little show and tell could have gone a long way, but after such a drought of discussion of ideas, the change was welcome.   \n   \nIncidentally, misters Hoefler and Frere-Jones, positively awed the audience with the rigor of their craft.   \n   \nOf course the greatest value of the conference (besides Lucille singing kareoke) was meeting so many interesting new people, reunited with old friends and deepening relationships with heretofor casual acquaintances. It was in these exchanges I took comfort in knowing that there are others out there who care as much as I - miraculously about the same issues.   \n   \nAs far as any new direction is concerned for the AIGA, that's tough to say. It has a diverse constituency and I think it is therefore difficult to make such generalizations, no matter how dearly some might wish to. I do think, however, that change will be manifest in two deomgraphics: region and age. Regional attitudes towards design, business and culture (and the degree to which they can be seen as independent from one another) are already becoming evident. This was clear from the presentations, but more notably from the sea of portfolios I reviewed. And age, well, there is a generation of 50 and 60 somethings who have defined the profession in the modern era but who are now close to the end of their run. I think in large part it will be the generation of current 30-somethings (many of whom work for or studied under the aforementioned) who fill the inevitable void and lead design into new territories by their example.\n\n"
