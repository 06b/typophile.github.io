  "content": "Any suggestions for Tintin fonts? I don 't need to match them exactly, but I'd like to evoke the feel of the books. There's the main lettering style of the body, a sort of slanted unconnected \"printing\" style, there's a more cursive style used in captions, and there's the titling style.\n\nI'd welcome suggestions for any of them.\n\n",
