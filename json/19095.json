  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m trying to find powerful block like fonts that look like they have parts broken or worn on the edges..or kinda crumbling. I have seen a few that are good but can’t remember the names, etc. At the same time, I don’t want ones that are kinda corny looking if you know what I mean.\n\nAny suggestions on fonts that may work??\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ (x) Extraterrestial Highway sign - Computer {Patricia}](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808064627/http:/typophile.com/node/19110 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Euskara signage ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808064627/http:/typophile.com/node/19079 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
