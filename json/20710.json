      "content": "Hi Chris. This chunky stuff is fun. But your using circular and losange counters is giving some of the characters major 'color' problems.\n\nThe 'e' is an example, where the 'beak' is too heavy. Would giving it a diagonal cross bar or chopping off the point at an angle make the circular counter work better? Also the diagonal characters at the open ends. Also the D. The numbers work quite well as is.\n\nI suspect that 'cheating' on circles and losanges, like you did with the K, might be the only way to overcome the color problems. Or maybe you could introduce a third shape or more shapes in the counters. Eg, in the diagonal letters keep the semi-circle at the join, but open up the 'v' at the ends of the diagonals.\n\n"

      "content": "William,  \nI know what you mean about the color issues. That is why I am making the companion face \"Ego\" which will work better at smaller sizes. I still want to keep the funky Lozenge character in Alter Ego though for large size uses. Maybe it is the graphic designer in me that wants to use large display cuts with character. I have been kicking this around for 2 months and have tried \"in the diagonal letters keep the semi-circle at the join, but open up the ‘v’ at the ends of the diagonals\" as you suggested. It works a bit better at small sizes that way but not well enough (while losing character). That is why I went back to the Lozenge and circle as concept. The Ego version will fix the smaller size issues you accurately described and make a pairing of fonts that will be meant to be used together.  \nRegarding the name of the face--my jaw dropped when you used the word \"Lozenge\" since it has been the working title for the font from day one. I still use that name on the file. Here is a screenshot of my FontLab window:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123031225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Lozenge_5699.png)\n\nThe word lozenge has the same first few letters of my last name as well as fits the shape of the counters. I am still debating going back to using it as a name. I thought \"Boulder\" was a better search engine name though so that is still a question.  \nAs always, I really appreciate your wisdom and perspective on type design.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
