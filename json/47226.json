Since recombobulating contours is ClownLab's absolute nadir function, I though I'd ask before starting an all day clown fix.\n\nCheers!\n\n",

If one can only parameterize to the point where 'nothing goes wrong' what's the point?

For example, give the parameters for weight in(de-)crease half the value.\n\nHopefully, this retains the node structure because no overlaps occur.\n\nThen, use MM-extrapolation to double the effect. You would generate an instance at -1000 or at 2000, depending on your setup. This should lead to exactly the same result you initially wanted, but without removed overlaps.\n\nIf halving the values is not sufficient (because it still creates and removes overlaps), try a third, or a quarter, amplifying the effect accordingly in the end. The more extreme your amplification the more rounding errors might come into play, however.  \nNote that when extrapolating you should always try to work with full numbers (i.e. thousands) because then at least this step is lossless.\n\n"

Then the unwanted problems will not occur.\n\nA.\n\n"

Both using MM-extrapolation.\n\nHard to say which method gives better results since increasing the weight can easily produce overlaps as well. I guess it depends on design and the individual letter: the risk of overlaps through producing overly thin \"negative weight\" strokes vs. ending up with overly tight overlapping counters.\n\nAnyway, this whole mess could easily avoided if the internal overlap removal was simply switched off. People can apply it in a subsequent step if they want to so I wouldn't even keep it as an option.\n\n"
