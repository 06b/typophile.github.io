      "content": "Well, Berlin has a couple of big schools. I don't know how friendly they are to foreign students who wan to come over for a semester. There are so many student enquiries already! Does your school in Denmark have a partnership with any schools in Berlin already? That could help a lot.\n\nAnyway, here are the schools that I can think of off the top of my head that teach graphic design in Berlin. These are all state-run institutions:\n\n[Universität der Künste Berlin](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013062334/http:/www.udk-berlin.de/sites/content/themen/aktuelles/index_ger.html)  \n [Kunsthocschule Weißensee](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013062334/http:/www.kh-berlin.de/)  \n [HTW Berlin](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013062334/http:/www.htw-berlin.de/)\n\nThen just across the city border is the [Fachhochschule Potsdam](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013062334/http:/www.fh-potsdam.de/).\n\n"
