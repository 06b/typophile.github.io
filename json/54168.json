They won't be able  \nto download the fonts or do anything else with them.\n\nThe engine in the back will produce a lowres pdf for the  \nclient and a highres pdf for me.\n\nAre there any legal issues\n\n",

      "content": "cheers james  \njust found this one on linotype\n\n5. Webserver License - Proofing model  \nThis model allows commercial printers who have a similar webserver model that allows their customers to design template documents (like a greeting card, or business card) and the server only shows the end-user a sample image (gif image for example) to simply “proof” the document. The document is then printed by the commercial printer for their customer. We also license this type of model on an annual contract basis (based on number of fonts, server cpus, and duration of the agreement).\n\nAm I right to say i would have to get a different license for the fonts (all my fonts are standard license, 5 computers)?\n\n"
