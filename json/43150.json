  "content": "Hey all,\n\nSo, I’m having trouble previewing a few fonts with Font Agent Pro - Mac OSX.\n\nInstead of displaying the proper typeface when previewed, they appear as a generic san-serif font which is incorrect. The pattern seams to happen most often with True Type fonts. The Font cache has been cleared and F.A.P. reinstalled a number of times on my machine but still the problem persists.\n\nThe strangest thing is that once these troubled fonts are activated they function fine in other applications. They also preview fine in OSX’s FontBook. It’s only when trying to preview from F.A.P. it becomes an issue. I contact F.A.P’s Tech support and went through there suggested fixes but the problem still persists.\n\nHas anyone experienced this or know of a possible solution?\n\nAny help is much appreciated!\n\n [‹ John Baskerville's Book of Common Prayer](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821123501/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43071 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Segoe Script - Where can I purchase this from? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821123501/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42987 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
