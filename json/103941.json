      "content": "You're welcome, josh5a.  \nDigitized under another name? That is indeed the 64 dollar question. But I doubt it. This font is not splashy or particularly elegant. Rather it is a workhorse design -- admittedly with with some interesting features -- in a market flooded with sans variations.  \nSufficient raw material for a font maker is available in the 1902 G & H catalog at pages 348 and 349. It is online in the form of a huge djvu or tiff file at [Archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018220711/http:/www.archive.org/details/ProbenVonSchriften).  \nNeverless, if anyone HAS seen a digital version a link would be good.  \nDon\n\n"
