This icon--which achieved a remarkable 93 percent recognition rate in the United States [emphasis added] --aspired to the simplicity and directness of a sans serif letterform. In 1984, the familiar bell symbol was transferred to the divested \"Baby Bells,\" and Bass & Yager designed a striated sphere for AT&T, aiming to signify the corporation's international stature and the ascendance of digital communications.\"\n\nThe AT&T Long Lines Department was responsible for connecting the local Bell companies together to provide long distance telephone communication between each Bell company. Here are two logos representing the time period between 1939 and 1963 and the time period after 1969.\n\n"
