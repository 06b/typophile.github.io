  "content": "Hi All\n\nI have employed a friend's graphic design company to re-design my company logo. He has come up with the following, and I was interested in other opinions. For what it is worth, my web-designer who does not know the graphic designer, hates the new logo, my company name, and my old logo!  \nYou may also need to know that we design houses, shop & restaurant interiors, small buildings, etc. Architectural design. See [www.katipodesign.co.nz](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022213414/http:/www.katipodesign.co.nz/ \"www.katipodesign.co.nz\") (the old website)\n\nThanks in advance.

Partly my argumentative nature I guess, because everyone says \"most people are scared of spiders, so don't use it\", just makes me want to use it more LOL.  \nMay I point out that Alfa Romeo has a snake, Lacoste has a croc. Scorpion sports moto-x gear, Balmain tigers, etc etc, so the scared of spiders argument doesn't convince me.  \nThere is a definite \"viral\" advantage to the spider - the ladies who work at the various Council Offices we deal with all remember the spider, so when I need help they often know me by name, likewise with many of the sales reps, Engineers etc, all of whom we require to complete a job.\n\nSo seriously, how offputting to the typical civilian is a spider name/logo?\n\n"

They admire their fastidious, diligent nature, not to mention their beautiful but incredibly strong webs. Tarantulas might be visually unappealing, but something like a Black Widow is incredibly elegant. I myself have no problem squashing a cockroach, but I will do my darndest to avoid killing a spider.\n\nHOWEVER:  \n1) It should definitely be a representational, not a realistic rendering.  \nAnd maybe something faceted, like this: [http://typophile.com/node/64559](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022213414/http:/typophile.com/node/64559 \"http://typophile.com/node/64559\")  \n2) No gradients, please. One or two solid colors.  \n3) That font has to go.\n\nhhp\n\n"

At least occasionally I have a client who is interested in Spiders (actually only one client ever).\n\nThere is another large firm in NZ called IGNITE Architecture, [www.ignitearchitects.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022213414/http:/www.ignitearchitects.com/ \"www.ignitearchitects.com/\") and I bet every person they canvassed about their name said \"sounds like your buildings burn down\".\n\nNZ's biggest architecture firm has the name JASMAX [www.jasmax.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022213414/http:/www.jasmax.com/ \"www.jasmax.com/\") (innovative website BTW) which as a name has nothing to do with architecture, or the values of the company.\n\nSounds like I am trying to defend my choice of spider as brand identity without any consideration of my clients......\n\nWhat comments have you all?\n\n"

Partly my argumentative nature\"\n\nPoisonous spiders and argumentative nature seem to be the last two things you'd want to communicate about your business.\n\nNow, that said, Katipo is a great word. Looking at your work, you appear to design sleek modern houses. I think the logo should reflect that aesthetic.\n\nFocus on simplicity, stability, geometry. If the name of the company is 'katipo' there's no real reason to have a literal spider be a part of the logo. That's overkill.\n\nNow, don't take this the wrong way, but, in general I've found architects to be wannabe graphic designers and graphic designers to be wannabe architects. While there is definite overlap, I don't think the skillsets are interchangeable. I'd love to design my own house some day but know that an architect would do a much better job than I would.\n\n"

For an architect, your brand image is really more about your portfolio than the logo itself.\n\n"
