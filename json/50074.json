I understand there needs to be some contrast because there’s no use to use two fonts that are almost alike.\n\nIf I use Vista sans bold for headings for example what font would be best for body text (except maybe Vista sans regular) and WHY? I would like explanations so I can match fonts by myself in future.\n\nPS. Please, no answers with “Match two fonts that look good together.” That never ment much unfortunately, thanks. :)\n\n [‹ Learning the Letters](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042531/http:/typophile.com/node/50090 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lions Gate Films logo redesign ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042531/http:/typophile.com/node/16834 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
