  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm looking for a typeface to work with Apex new ( [www.vllg.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023225051/http:/www.vllg.com/ \"www.vllg.com\")).  \nApex will be used for body copy and i need a title face to go with it. It is being used for a major Sporting Stadium currently under construction. The typeface will be used primarily to number sections of the stadium and key wayfinding signage. The typeface needs to be highly ledgible, and reproduce well in a large format.\n\nSome suggestions i have had are DIN, and a custom version of DIN with rounded corners. Neither of which i think are suitable.\n\nI look forward to some suggestions!  \nThanks in advance.\n\nThomas.\n\n",
