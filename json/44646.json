  "content": "I expect to be working on a magazine design very soon. I also expect the budget to be small and the timeframe to be tight. I am considering various typefaces for editorial, heads, sub-heads, features etc. I really like Neutraface by House Industries, the $500 pricetag is a little high but it is comprehensive and has the right mix of contemporary and classic to it.  \nI also really like Gotham by H&FJ and it's a little more affordable at $400 complete.\n\nThe magazine is a local entertainment and lifestyle publication. My idea is that by getting the correct type from the get-go will set the tone for the rest of the magazine.\n\nI have no ideas for the body type as of yet.\n\nAny help or pointers would be great.\n\nJay\n\n",

Then too, the small sizes for captions and callouts were very appealing too.\n\nI haven't played with or seen as much Neutraface (especially the new #2 with higher crossbars), but I suspect it feels a little more mechanical and geometric. The bowls in Verlag tend to be narrower and less circular. Overall it's a very warm impression for a geometric design, maybe more deco than geometric.\n\n"

Think I still may prefer Neutra for now but it's on the list.\n\nANOTHER QUESTION:\n\nWould I be on the wrong path to use the same family for heads and body?\n\nI need to do some more research and see what others are doing and what I like. It seems that if your gonna spend $500 on a family it would be nice if that could be for the editorial copy too. Maybe it's just a matter of taste.\n\n"

As long as a typeface has the fonts you need to create the right contrasts, you’ll be fine. You can add new display types later–for pull quotes, etc—as budget allows to keep things fresh.\n\nSince you’re already considering H&FJ look at Whitney. It’s very gorgeous and very capable; the specimens just don’t do it justice. I believe Flaunt has been using it as their text face for a while now. [Also, take a look at Jos Buivenga’s free/inexpensive typefaces.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020230345/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/index.html) I’m doing a magazine with only his stuff right now and it looks great! Museo is only $30 for five weights that scale well and can create incredible contrast.\n\n"

The audience is luxury lifestyle, expensive condo and restaurant types who live in a city in South Florida. I want contemporary with some art-deco undertones.\n\nMany thanks for all the advice guys - please do keep it coming. I am looking at all of these suggestions very carefully.\n\n"

      "content": "Use a strong serif for body copy and a well-matched sans for heads, subheads, sidebars, headlines, etc. Never, but never, consider sans for body copy: nobody wants to read that much of any sans.\n\nThe biggest and crispest serif face for 9pt is Stone Serif, and you can use either Stone Sans (designed to go with it) or Linotype Syntax for the sans. All can be used with oldstyle figures (Stone Serif and Sans have to be ordered from ITC not Adobe if you want the OSFs; Linotype's version of Syntax comes with OSFs.)\n\n10pt Linotype Sabon paired with Linotype Syntax, both with OSFs, also works beautifully.\n\nDon't try to get cute and stylish with the body copy, except to use oldstyle figures instead of liner figures. Use your headline choice of sans for your big style statement.\n\n"

The idea is that all four have the exact same character width, allowing for equal interchange of them all. Then again, you don't want to be a copycat, and rolling stone isn't exactly the same audience either.\n\n"

      "content": "John S.,\n\nI would think that being located in New York would make it obvious to you that magazine publishing is a high-turnover, fashion-driven area of design. Are you actually suggesting that a new design for a lifestyle/entertainment magazine (not a series of books) use Stone Serif? Way to embalm a design. Cute and stylish are actually front and center in magazine design, however upsetting this may be for you.\n\n\"Never, but never, consider sans for body copy: nobody wants to read that much of any sans\"\n\nThis is like your repeated squawking about font pricing; it's intended to create the perception that everyone wants what you want. Iif you would be bothered to look around, you will discover that many, many magazines (again, not books) use all kinds of sans faces at all sizes, including for editorial material. The categorical rejection of sans designs reveals your conservatism, something that has little place in magazine design.\n\nIn a word: speak for yourself.\n\nJay,\n\nI'm not sure why you fixate on the highest prices, for the complete superfamilies. It's quite possible to develop varied, rich layouts for magazines with a modest family. The Verlag and Neutra families I linked to are $200 or $250, not $400 and $500. Do you need every single style, width and weight? Examine how you would use the type, and then make a corresponding purchase. For $500 you could get 3 wonderful, versatile families that would serve you for years. I don't find that the condensed variants are nearly as useful as the regular widths. Also, Neutra has text and Display variants, and you could just use the Text variants for everything; a sans like that scales well. More savings.\n\nAlso take a look at packages and families from Storm; he has made collections you might find useful, and there are superfamilies that might work for you: Anselm and Amor; both have serif and sans variants. Look at them by categories for font pairing ideas.\n\n"

      "content": "Whether you should use sans or serif for body copy just depends on how text-intensive your publication is. In the case of art mags with short articles well broken by white space and images, sans works perfectly well, but it should be the more interesting ones with aggressive personalities, like DTL Prokyon, Annivers, or Linotype Giacomo. Most magazines do not offer such an environment, however; needless to say, it's not about conservative vs progressive, a meaningless distinction in design today; it's about what is suitable \\*and\\* is interesting.\n\n"
