There is a spanish company which produces rip-off of these with the same technique (used truck parts), therefore doing unique bags also, for 1/4th of the Freitag price.\n\ndr\n\n"

      "content": "As someone who comes from the Homeland of Freitag (everybody and their dog have one or more of these bags here): hell yeah they are cool. And pricey.\n\nThere are a bunch of companies doing a similar thing for a lot less money. In fact a Swiss supermarket, which is known to more or less creatively rip off all sorts of brand names, launched a very similar bag line called Donnerstag (“Thursday” as opposed to “Friday”) a while ago. They had to stop selling them quite quickly though. :D\n\nWhat speaks for Freitag, though, (and no they don’t pay me) is not only that it’s a cool idea to make bags pretty much exclusively from recycled materials (apart from the tarps, the straps are made of recycled car safety belts, and the little rubber things that close off the seams on the edges of the tarps are recycled bicycle tubes). Also, they are virtually indestructible. They originated as bike messenger bags, so depending on the model they’re huge, nice to carry, and pretty waterproof too.\n\nI have two, the large one (with a fat Helvetica on it) is about 9 years old and is very slowly beginning to wear thin on the corners (which just makes it look even more recycled), and I use it practically every day. The small one (with a fat Frutiger on it) is about 2 years old and practically looks like new (well except that they look kind of used from the beginning). So yeah, I would def recommend them, though of course I have no way of knowing if there may be other companies that offer comparable quality for a seriously lowered price.\n\n"
