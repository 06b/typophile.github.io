I applaud your early planning.\n\nThere is nothing quite like [Exchange](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214113213/http:/typographica.org/001103.php#exchange-fonts). Maybe [Nimrod](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214113213/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/nimrod/). For Vitesse, consider [Dispatch](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214113213/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Dispatch), [Stainless](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214113213/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Stainless), and [Stratum](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214113213/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Stratum%20OT). We've discussed other alternatives [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214113213/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33255).\n\n"
