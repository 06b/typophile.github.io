      "content": "I’m with Jan. Let’s say it’s **a** fette Fraktur.  \nBack in the days, fonts didn’t necessarily have genuine names, but were described by their genre. Almost every foundry had some fette Fraktur. The known digitizations are based on the Stempel version, which before was distributed by C.E. Weber, which in turn goes back to the one designed by Johann Christian Bauer and released by Joh. Peter Nees & Co. Of course there are differences from version to version. If you don’t know about the origin, I doubt that you can track down – or assign – a proper name.\n\nThe B and D in [Fette Haenel-Fraktur](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417032855/http:/moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/f/fettehaenel.htm) are a better match. The other characters aren’t. Do you have a full alphabet?\n\n"
