I pointed him to FontShop, and also told him about House and a couple of other foundries. He replied that he thought paying for fonts was “dumb” and that he’ll just stick to dafont.com.\n\nMaybe the production designers of Idiocracy weren’t too far off the mark.\n\n- Lex\n\nP.S. This guy considers himself a designer.\n\n"
