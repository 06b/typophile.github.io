Having re-read the documentation I am still feeling oddly sqeamish.\n\n",

In other words, they are not meant to be combined with base letters, and have advanced widths greater than zero. Proper combining mark characters are in the Unicode 0300 block, and are zero-width characters that can be combined on base letters or in mark stacks. A non-combining mark is canonically equivalent in Unicode to the space character plus a combining mark, so either method is accepted to display the mark without a visible base.\n\nNot all combinations of base + mark are separately encoded in Unicode; indeed, most are not. The expectation is that combining marks will be used with base characters to form additional diacritic combinations, using OpenType GPOS and features to correctly position the marks.\n\nIn the interests of processing efficiency, if text contains e.g. A plus a combining acute character, and the font used includes the precompose Aacute character, this will be autuomatically mapped on Windows in applications using the Unscribe text processor. This is a buffered character level mapping, which is faster than glyph level mapping in the layout feature or GPOS mark positioning,\n\n"

      "content": "Eben,  \nyou should definitely spend some time with the Unicode table PDFs, as well as checking out the sites devoted to The World of Diacritics. I spend a lot of time on these sites:  \n [http://www.unicode.org/charts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021233428/http:/www.unicode.org/charts/ \"http://www.unicode.org/charts/\")  \n [http://www.eki.ee/letter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021233428/http:/www.eki.ee/letter/ \"http://www.eki.ee/letter/\")  \n [http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=1](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021233428/http:/diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=1 \"http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=1\")\n\nThere are Unicode indices for hundreds of accented glyphs, and different keyboard layouts map to accents differently, but the usual way things work is request accent, then request letter, which triggers the single glyph \"letteraccent\".\n\nWhich is why you can't just ask for a di(a)eresis + n to get the ndieresis accent needed for Spinal Tap: that glyph isn't mapped to a Unicode index, and system sotware doesn't recognise this as a valid combination. Hell, even with REAL accents, like lacute (uni013A), you can't use your U.S. keyboard layout and ask for an acute with an l under it. (This glyph is used in Slovak, and is supported by the 8859-2 character map.)\n\nAnother reason not to try to make accented glyphs using liga is that some accents come in a few different forms. Adam very kindly showed me how one should make ogoneks, and the \"standard\" ogonek one uses in a sans font is usually too wide for the I and i, so you have to tweak.\n\nYet another reason: Tracking. When you track text in InDesign - by request or as a function of justified setting - at a certain point the ligas will \"split\" back into their component parts. Otherwise it would look silly. (I'm sure we've all seen loosely tracked text with fi and fl ligatures, which look like little siamese twins...) One exception to this rule is the Dutch \"ij\", which is actually a descendent of ydieresis, and is always a single character, even when tracked. Here's the sign for the local butcher:  \nS L A G E R IJ\n\nAs always when developing type, you have to follow certain conventions, and you have to follow the standards. Not because slavishness is good, but because software and wetware (aka \"users\") know how to do things one way, and you shouldn't ask them to learn a new way of doing things just for your font. Build your types to be out-of-the-box usable by anyone, and if you have \"special\" functionality, make it available for expert users.\n\n"

I would include 'ccmp' feature lookups for all precomposed diacritic glyphs in the font, despite the fact that some applications may use character level composition for diacritics with their own Unicode values. This provides fallback for an application that supported 'ccmp' but did not do such character level processing. Of course, 'ccmp' must be used for any diacritic glyph that does not have its own Unicode value.\n\n'liga' is a bad idea for diacritic composition because the user can turn it off. 'rlig' would be better in that regard, but 'ccmp' is expressly designed for this purpose (and can also be used for glyph decomposition).\n\n"

      "content": "Chester, there is no significant difference between having precomposed diacritics in Unicode and having sequences of bases and combining marks. Many hundreds of languages rely on combining mark sequences, and these languages are fully supported by Unicode and by Unicode-savvy systems and applications. Keyboard layouts frequently make the encoding model invisible to the user: he presses a key and gets Ẹ́ and that gets rendered using one of several possible character-\\>glyph options. He may neither know nor care whether that diacritic is encoded as one, two or three characters.\n\nThe only reason there are _any_ precomposed diacritic characters in Unicode is for one-to-one backwards compatibility with pre-existing character set standards which, unsurprisingly, happen to be mainly for majority writing systems of industrialised nations. But if you take into account some of the Unicode normalisation forms, even these writing systems may end up being largely encoded using combining mark sequences in future. The W3C consortium, for example, recommends a normalisation form that involves canonical decomposition, so it is quite likely that future browsers and XML document handlers will break down even common European diacritics like é into e plus combining acute.\n\nNormalisation is the process of determining a standard encoding for character clusters that could be encoded in multiple ways. That Ẹ́ diacritic, for instance, could be encoded in three different ways: ‹0045, 0323›, ‹00C9, 0301, 0323› or ‹00C9, 0323, 0301›, all of which should be rendered identically and all of which have totally equivalent semantics for the reader. But if you want to search, sort or compare text strings, it is essential that a single canonically correct, normalised order is used to encode Ẹ́, and for this purpose fully decomposed combining mark sequences are highly desirable. From a text processing perspective, combining mark sequences are actually preferable to precomposed diacritic characters, since the latter need to be decomposed for the most efficient normalisation.\n\n"

At best, they will recognize that it's a letter at all but will no nothing about a resonable sorting order or the mapping between a lowercase and the uppercase variant. If you encode the character in the normal (decomposed) way, then even older applications will know that we are talking about a Latin E with a bunch of diacritics. Even if they won't necessarily know it's Yoruba, they'll be able to infer many more properties that from a new precomposed codepoint. For example, an application will most likely sort the word starting with such character somewhere after the plain \"E\", it will figure out that the lowercase counterpart is \"e\" followed by the respective diacritics etc.\n\nTypesetting applications should take care of the correct presentation and of the fact that the character should be treated as one character and not three when moving cursor, selecting text, counting letters etc. This has nothing to do with the way the text is encoded.\n\nAdding more codepoints to Unicode will not help Yoruba -- on the contrary, it will marginalize it more!\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"
