I love FF Dax but it seems to be coming into overused and the narrowing of the stroke at intersections makes large letters look more like a font for commercial shops.   \nI really want to keep the stemless \"m\" and \"n\" as well as the general open shape of the \"a\". So far, I've only found two fonts that have the same feel as Dax. Marten and Modula. The first one isn't very readable (rounded endings) and the second one is polluted by extra stems everywhere.   \nAny suggestions for something like FF Dax?   \nThanks.   \n   \nHere's a sample of Dax by the way.   \n ![FF Dax sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090422im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19563.gif)\n\n",

Some that I thought might be worth considering are T-26's 'Flux' (Part 3 of the Guide); 'Leger' (also T-26) in Part 4, and Tabasco in Part 6.

Even good old [Bernhard Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090422/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=204425) has stemlessness going for it.

      "content": "My point about the Bauhaus-style fonts is that even though many of the samples in the Guide are modern fonts, their simplified geometric forms owe very much to the styles of Herbert Bayer and his stylistic movement. Sans serif styles were already a measure of simplification over serif fonts, and the Bauhaus-style carries it further by reducing many of the forms to as simple a shape as possible. Bayer even wanted to reduce the alphabet to [uncials](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090422/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces7.html) to simplify it to its limit, I guess. The arc-shaped 'n' in so many of these styles is one of the earmarks to me, but the stemless 'n' (as in Dax and Bernhard Gothic) is a stylistic compromise to retain a bit more of the familiar form. The (to me) grotesquely ugly square 'tech' look takes this simplification to the direction of avoiding curved lines, and I think begins to lose contact with anything human (hence the 'tech' label). You can have it, if it means draining all the life out of the letters. Cunieform letters also avoided curves, but for a reason related to the medium (clay) and the writing tool (stylus) that makes much more human sense than today's computer-drawn squares. Sure, LCD technology (and it's predecessors) depended on straight line segments to render alphanumeric characters, but that is now 20-30 years old. How does a style derived from that look become symbolic of 'high tech'? And while I'm ranting, how about the fact that 'Eurostile/Microgramma', which is apparently the epitome of the Tech-Look, is over 40 years old!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Mike, I have had your bauhaus page booked marked for some time now. It's nice to see you pop up like that. You actually identified Marten for me a few months ago.   \n   \nI think that the context has changed enormously these past 10 years for so called tech fonts. They seem to have been appropriated by the youth scene in particular (rave, clubs, parties, dj events, sci-fi tv and movies, etc).   \nThe more established ones like Eurostile and Handel are now widely seen in shops everywhere (even my laudraumat uses Eurostile for signage).   \n   \nParallel to that, the real high tech field has changed dramatically during the same period. The desired image of dynamic, young, fun, and hip from the 90's (Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, Marimba, ...) has now been changed back to the more conservative image of serious (restrained), professional and efficient.   \n   \nIn that context, I think that its now very tricky to use a \"tech\" font for a tech company. Bauhaus lines (stemlessness for one) conveys efficiency and modernism to me. The tech side must still be present as a somewhat \"square\" look, although it must be much more subtle than before. Most important though, the conservative, professional but forward looking image must comes from a well balance (humanist?) body type font with clean lines (sans-serif).   \nThese are the parameters I'm trying to play with.   \n   \nFor reference, I've played with latest suggestions. Here we go...   \n   \nInfinity, Armada and Prosper are too squarish. They could easily be used for rave ads.   \nInfinity   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090422im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19647.gif)   \nArmada   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090422im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19648.gif)   \nProsper   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090422im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19649.gif)   \n   \nBernhard Gothic shows its age (t and a).   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090422im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19650.gif)   \n   \nApex-sans is quite nice, but it's more in the vein of a Mittelschrift.
