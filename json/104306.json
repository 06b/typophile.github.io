      "content": "Thanks for the feedback. I've never seen such a Q either, and even the rest of the font looks ... off. I knew the guy who created this logo and honestly- he isn't really a creative type so I have no idea where a custom font would have come from. I'll look into it some more and see if I can find out where it might have come from.\n\nIf nothing else- I have some larger, higher resolution versions of this font and I can just turn it into an SVG and work with that if necessary.\n\n"
