  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI’ve gone through all the fonts for most software including Photoshop,  \nOffice, Quark etc.\n\nI’ve also tried all of the “automated” online font ID services with  \nno luck (some are good at asking the right questions but then suggest  \nfonts that don’t match my answers, anyhow).\n\nAlso browsed many online fonts and foundries.\n\nITC Ronda is definitely not it though it’s about as close as I could  \nget.\n\nSome of the key features are the single storey “a” and the no-spur “r”.\n\nImage below and thanks in advance for any help. I know this font came  \nfrom somewhere because I’m no font founder :).\n\nCheers.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195857im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_3_5355.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_3.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195857/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_3_0.gif) | 3.96 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Is Gill Sans Infant just Schoolbook in OTF? - yes {Andy B (self)}](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195857/http:/typophile.com/node/32888 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Heavy square sans in Scratch Magazine - Register {Stephen} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911195857/http:/typophile.com/node/33315 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

My daughter was a 1st grader at the time and about 80% of the kids in her school were immigrants from Central and South America. My daughter was trying to help some of her classmates with English and they, in turn, were helping her with Spanish. The books were school level simple with big type that looked much like that. Perhaps you might check some Spanish sources?\n\nChrisL\n\n"
