So i just wanna say tanxs to everyone who participates in here and continue with the good job in the maintenance of this wonderfull place.   \n   \nAs a begginer, i have many doubts in how to do a typeface, and i know i still have many work to do on this font, i start it about a month and now i really would like to hear some opinions and some answers to technical problems that i have, to continue and improve my work.   \nI haven't done the capitals neither the numberals, since there are some points that i need some help.   \n   \nSo comments are very welcome.   \n   \nSince now tanxs to all   \n   \nLuis\n\n",

      "content": "Hello Luis and congratulations for the type face, good starting. I also want to make some suggestings and questions. The l/c x have different expessures, which is visible if you use as a display font, but is looking great with small sizes. I prefere to see that kind of forms a relation betten then which create a better uniformity for all letters, for exemple ( use the letter (o) to create the bowl of the (g), (b), (d), (p), (q), or using the letter (n) to give the aperture and struture for the (y),(u).   \n   \n1 \\> Did you use any over-shoot (baseline overshoot, x-height overshoot ) to differentiate the limits of the round parts?   \n   \n2 \\> How you make the relation betten letters when use the round terminal ( b, e, q).   \n   \nIts very interesting your type face and I want to see how your serene grow up during the time.   \nBoa aparição Luis e força com esta tua bonita tipografia / Comprimentos.   \n   \nRicardo Santos\n\n"

      "content": "If this is your first effort, I think you have great instincts - make sure they survive your upcoming \"formal\" learning effort.   \n   \nI'd go further than Stephen and say that I think there are actually too many good ideas here! They're fighting for attention, and I think more discipline would create more functionality. So I'd spread out the good ideas over multiple fonts\\*, instead of maybe trying to make one \"ultimate\" font (which never works). For example, your \"e\" has a nice organic feel, and the stem on your \"o\" is amazing, but together they're maybe too much of a good thing. And then there are some glyphs which are a bit \\*too\\* plain, like the \"x\" I think has a lot more potential.   \n   \n\\* Maybe a set of fonts that work together?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Knowing Hrant's love near fetish [;-)] with Rotis I think I know what he's saying and that would be interesting, I'm not necessarily disagreeing here. IMO some display type gets boring when all of the characters are too identical in nature. Make sense?\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with Hrant. I think you have (at least) two really good fonts here.   \n   \n\"b\", \"e\", \"f\", \"k\", \"m\", \"n\", \"o\", \"q\", and \"t\" all have a similar feel, taking the more innovative road, while   \n   \n\"d\", \"g\", \"h\", \"p\", \"u\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", and \"z\" all fit together in the more conservative path.   \n   \nThe remaining characters (\"a\", \"c\", \"i\", \"j\", \"l\", \"r\", \"s\", and \"y\") could adequately fit with either of the other two sets as they are, or they could be pushed even closer to conformity to either set with slight modifications.   \n   \nI'd love to see a new \"x\" designed to echo the design of the \"k\", for example. And inverting the existing \"n\" could be an interesting approach to the \"u\", especially with how that would position the \"u\"'s tail. A similar treatment could be adapted to the \"d\", \"g\", \"p\" and \"y\".   \n   \nI'm excited to see what you do with this font.   \n   \nDavid\n\n"

And my question is how i can mantain the overture in the b/e/q   \n   \nwhen i use lower sizes ????, cos the overture disappears.   \n   \nSo i'll redo my work, and emend some questions that i need to.
