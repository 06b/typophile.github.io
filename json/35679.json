Your contribution, in exchange for the membership item(s) you select, provides financial support to keep Typophile thriving. This allows us to avoid the overhead of subscriptions or membership dues.\n\n<!-- break -->\n\nWe also think the stuff will fit neatly into your typo-centric lifestyle.\n\nWe're pleased to announce a storefront (still in pre-gussied-up CSS, but still very usable) to make the new 2007 \"Type Specimen\" tee and new found ephemera buttons available. We will also make available the remaining stock of past year's shirts where we have stock available.\n\nEven if the items aren't your thing, we invite you to contribute in any way you feel appropriate.\n\n**[Typophile Merchandise](http://web.archive.org/web/20071101073300/http:/typophile.bigcartel.com/)**\n\n",

The whole Typophile material is very cool, I wish I have an international card to buy some buttons.  \nIf you have some free time visit my little foundry website. the english version is coming soon, but the portuguese version is working fine, and you can travel on it by feeling.\n\ngreat hugs from Brasil,\n\nJuliano August°  \n [www.fonduefontes.com.br](http://web.archive.org/web/20071101073300/http:/www.fonduefontes.com.br/ \"www.fonduefontes.com.br\")\n\n"
