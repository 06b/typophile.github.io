They're commonly used to help users of the font quickly assess a character set. They may also be useful to designers in the process of designing their own work but they are too compact for a more thorough assessment. Perhaps the most common pangram is _The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog._\n\nClever pangrams:  \n_Boxer M. Tyson packs his bags with Jay-Z DVDs, Quik, Holyfield's ear._ -- BJ Harvey\n\n_Typophile Boxing! Papazian jousts with quaking, anonymous detractor.
