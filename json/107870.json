  "content": "I've done some Internet searches, but all I've got is some big words such as \"quadratic B-splines\" or \"cubic Bezier splines\". I've examined some fonts and I've been assuming that TrueType outlines are controlled by on and off-curved nodes (which are easier to adjust), and PostScript outlines by on-curved and handled nodes (which feel much more like \"Bezier\" to me). But I've just found out that most fonts I have with the OTF extension are recognized with \"OpenType Layout, TrueType outlines\" and with \"(OpenType)\" going after their family names (they've got PostScript outlines as I assumed). What I've learned from the Internet is that fonts with such info should be OpenType TT fonts, with the TTF extension, with \"(TrueType)\" after the fonts' family names; the OTF suffix should goes with \"OpenType Layout, PostScript outlines\" (OpenType PS). Am I wrong or something weird is going with m,y Windows' font classifying?\n\n",

      "content": "The main difference between the outlines is the type of splines and the direction of drawing – I think they're drawn clockwise in TT and counterclockwise in PS.\n\nAs for Windows, it considers a TrueType font to be OpenType if it finds a table named \"DSIG\" in it, OpenType being a sort-of super-TrueType that can hold either type of outline along with a zoo of positioning and substitution data tables.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with Thomas. My first attempts to edit fonts -- with font editors that are long since obsolete -- were with true type and were extremely frustrating. Ps is a dream by comparison. But ps is weak for presentation of very complex designs, so ttf has its advantages. Otf is really just a wrapper for either ps or ttf formats. Either flavor can work fine as otf. Bit of history -- ps was the first really good digital font format, i.e. Adobe etc. Microsoft didn't own it, so promoted the alternative ttf. Even today, fonts packaged with Microsoft products are ttf.  \nDon\n\n"
