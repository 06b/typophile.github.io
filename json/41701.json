All good yes, but the problem with said job is........... they only design on PC's and use Quark. Being a person who has only designed on Macs and is mostly familiar with InDesign, the thought of this scares me.\n\nThe idea of working on a PC is making me about 95% sure I don't want to take this job.\n\nWhat would you do?  \nNew job, more money, PC, Quark  \nOld job, less money, Mac, InDesign\n\n",

They probably invested heavily into one system and software to cut down on compatibility issues years ago and kept up with it.\n\nMyself, I much prefer working on a Mac, because i know the OS and hot keys; but Windows isn't all that bad, just different.

I spent several years working only with Macs. And then, one day, I started a job where each designer had a Mac _and_ a PC. At first it was troublesome, but pretty soon I got the hang of it. I am no longer at that job, but learning how to use a Windows machine was helpful. I still prefer Macs, though (sorry, Darth).\n\nAs for QuarkXPress, back in Version 3.x days, the Windows version was awful. Nowadays it is pretty similar to its Mac counterpart. I too have my InDesign keyboard shortcuts set to the Quark 4 shortcuts! But you can't set Quark to InDesign shortcuts... Sorry.\n\n"

I worked on macs while being at university, then \"returned\" to windows (XP) because it still felt more natural to me (it's all about being used to a system), and now I returned to OSX again...  \nI did Indesign, xPress, Illu, Photoshop, HTML-Coding, making books, marketing material, fonts and everyday work on the system, and it was very reliable and in 5 years there were no compatibility issues with printing services, fonts, or when exchanging data with other windows- or osx-machines. So: it works.\n\nAfter one week on OSX, I am at about lets say 60% of my usual working speed, but I am slowly getting used to it, adjusting the system and getting used to it. I've learned that one has to tweak OSX as well as one has to tweak Windows, out of the box both of them are hard to get used to if you compare it to a machine fully adjusted to your needs you used before.

But I knew I was smart enough and nimble enough to make the machine switch. And I wanted the job: the type of work, the added money, the new responsibilities, the shorter commute.\n\nThese are the sort of things you should think about. They are not asking you to switch religion [I hope], or to get rid of your dog and get a cat. It is just a damn machine.\n\nThink through what you really want. Machines and software can be mastered.\n\npowers\n\nPS: I was offered the job. Before the offer was made, the Managing Editor talked with other book designers and found that Mac / Quark was the preferred combination. On the day she asked me to come to work here she also said \"Give me a Macintosh shopping list.\" So in the end I had not to make the switch.
