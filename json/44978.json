The Ace Ventura poster, more specifically the business card seen prominently on the poster. Here's the image:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131127060029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ace_3509.jpg)\n\nI'd like to know the font used for \"Ace Ventura\" or, if not an exact match, something that has similar styles for: C, V, N, U, R and A. Most specifically C and R.\n\nSecondly, what is the handwriting style font used for the \"To serve and protect...\" text?\n\nThanks in advance :D\n\n",
