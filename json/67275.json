  "content": "The lowercase Greek available for Sabon has turned out to be unsuitable for a project I am currently working on: some of the ‘Roman’ lowercase Greek letters appear too latinised (e.g., pi and tau with a thin horizontal stroke), and — more importantly — the Italic ones are not all distinguishable from similar-looking Latin letters (e.g., a and alpha), which makes them useless in mathematical formulae.\n\nBoth aesthetic and practical considerations have thus brought me to look for a font whose lowercase Greek letters could work together with Sabon Greek uppercase and Latin. So far, the best I have come up with is Garamond Premier Pro Roman, which I think could work both for short Greek citations in the text and for variable names in the formulae. Would that be a bad choice? Any other suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance for any comments and ideas.\n\n",

But what a good pairing is depends on the context of use: is this for a parallel text, where the two scripts are in paragraph-blocks but not intermingling, or an edition with Greek embedded within English (as you'd get, for example, in a linguistics textbook)?\n\n"

      "content": "To elaborate on what Gerry Leonidas implicitly said, and that being the crux of the matter: if you are working on a text where the Greek alphabet is embedded within the Latin one, you may look for a match for a very long time indeed and never find it, because the main points are really the x-height, the weight, the detail, etc., and, most of all, the overall tone (‘colour’). Why don’t you just go for another, single typeface? There are some good ones out there, which treat Greek as Greek, and not as a subdivision of Latin. I don’t know who developed this ‘Greek’ for Sabon, but I am (almost) sure it wasn’t Tchitchold.\n\n"

But for running text, be sure, this will be hard to master.\n\nThen, choosing a typeface whith both decent Latin and Greek might be the way to go. You shall find something which meets your requirements.\n\n2. Check some of [John Hudson’s fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315032632/http:/www.tiro.com/fonts.html).\n\n3. Check Johannes Küster’s [extension work to Minion](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315032632/http:/www.typoma.de/en/index.html) which focuses on mathematical composing aspects in particular.\n\n4. Check [Andron](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315032632/http:/www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=218&changelang=2), which has been designed exactly for the case you describe, with a Greek lowercase to harmonize but not to be equalized.\n\n– Finally, the last exit may be to do new glyphs for Sabon Greek.\n\n"

      "content": "We all seem to agree that the existing Greek (or ‘Greek’, as Ton Aner put it) is worthy neither of Tschichold and Sabon nor of the Greek script. I might be able to improve the worst glyphs slightly, but a proper Greek Sabon would probably have to involve a full set of new lowercase letters, which is far beyond my abilities.\n\nAs Lex Kominek seemed to imply, a less latinised Greek might work better when two different fonts are used for Greek (lowercase) and Latin. The suggested combinations with existing Greek fonts give the following results:\n\nMinion\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315032632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/greek-Minion_4300.png)\n\nGentium:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315032632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/greek-Gentium_4308.png)\n\nGaramond:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315032632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/greek-Garamond_5992.png)\n\nChoosing a different font is not really an option: Sabon has the right style for a technical academic work, it happens to be the institution's standard typeface, and I have added some mathematical glyphs, brackets etc. for use with LaTeX which would have to be redesigned to match a different font.\n\nThanks for mentioning the extensions to Minion (of which I was aware, but I did not know that they had become available), as well as Andron, whose Runic and Fraktur-inspired parts in particular look very interesting.\n\n"
