Notice the o and w loops and the r shape of the latter font. However the I is all wrong, as are the k and s shapes, but that's where Monoline Script comes in.\n\nThe shapes are not exact, but I could imagine this being a design compromise to make the embroidery lettering easier to read.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "I believe that Monoline Script -- already mentioned by Mike Yanega -- has the letter forms used as the basis for much of this script. Some letters such as \\_f\\_ look almost identical, others such as \\_A\\_ or \\_k\\_ have the same basic form but have been modified to make some of the strokes more flourished. The result seems less mechanical than Monoline Script, and perhaps has improved legibility when embroidered.  \nDon\n\n"
