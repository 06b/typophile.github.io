Maybe there’s something new in CS4?\n\nI use a little workaround that is almost as fast as having only one style:\n\n- set up two paragraph styles: one without indent (#1), one with indent (#2)\n- within the style options for #1, set the ‘next’ parameter to ‘#2’\n- select all your text and ‘apply paragraph style #1 and then next’\\*, via a right-click (control-click) in the paragraph style palette\n\n\\*) I don’t know how the exact wording is in the English version  \nF\n\n"

      "content": "The simplest way to achieve this, in my opinion, is the good old-fashioned way. One paragraph style for your basic text style. Include a tab position at the first indent. Use a tab at the beginning of every paragraph except the first one. Seems unsophisticated, I know. But after years of trying to be fancy about it, I realized that simplest is best.\n\n— K.\n\n"

      "content": "I’d second what Kent says. Been doing it that way for 25 years, seems to work fine.\n\nYou can set the tab position in your paragraph style(s), so each time you hit the tab, you will get the indent. And of course, with different paragraph styles, you can have a different indent value. I frequently use 1 pica for a text paragraph indent, but 1 em (further) for an extract paragraph indent.\n\n"

      "content": "You know, when I started out, I thought “tabs are for typewriters, we have computers now” and I used to try to work with paragraph indents in styles. But that just led to a population of multiple parent/child paragraph styles. Not to mention the fact that I was constantly having to remove the tabs that copywriters and editors were putting in their copy (silly editors ;-). And then applying all these multiple paragraph styles.\n\nNeedless to say, it didn’t take long to see the error of my ways. Fancy-schmancy; simple is better.\n\nNow, on the off-chance that I get a manuscript without tabs, all I have to do is search for paragraph breaks and replace with para break + tab. Then remove the few that come after a heading. Not too onerous.\n\n— K.\n\n"

The editors I love are the one that sometimes use a tab and sometimes five word spaces (they think it is the same).\n\n"
