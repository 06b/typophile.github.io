I think this font used to be used in railroad advertisements, and may even still be used today.\n\nWhat do you think the name of this font is?  \nThank you for helping!!!!!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [script.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015192841/http:/typophile.com/files/script_4.png) | 11.1 KB |\n\n",
