When you read an interesting post and want to know the author's profile, something like 3 out of 5 times, it's somebody in Canada!\n\nIs there a background to this? Does Canada indeed have a particularly strong typographic tradition? If yes, how did it come about?\n\nWhile one reads so much about typography and the Netherlands, I really haven't seen much about Canada. Would love to know more.\n\nIf this ground has been covered already in an earlier thread, I'd be grateful if anybody can point me to it.\n\n",

I know there's some life in Sweden, and even budding typelife in Finland, where the art has been almost non-existant until fairly recently.\n\nI've been wondering about the Canadian angle, too.

In British Columbia, for instance, there's a handful of people who have had a major impact on my work and interests, including Jan & Crispin Elsted (of Barbarian Press in Mission, BC - likely one of the finest letterpress printer/publishers out there), Bringhurst in the Gulf Islands, Jim Rimmer and Robert Reid in Vancouver, and then there's the Alcuin Society in Vancouver as well, which puts on Canada's national book design awards along with various other book-related events such as the Wayzgoose fine-press book fair which just happened on November 17th at the Vancouver Public Library. There are also a lot of small, fine-press publishers around here who have formed a fairly tight sense of community, largely over the wire, but it keeps things interesting to swap stories with others wrestling with font choice and tricky Vandercooks.\n\nAnd as for the crack about the CBC, I'm pretty sure that CBC Radio 2 is a contributing factor to much of the book work coming out of Canada: almost everyone I know who makes books has that station on in the background 18 hours a day.\n\nAnd the weather probably does play a certain role: here in the Okanagan it's 40 degrees in the summer, so all you can do is sit in the shade and read in the afternoons, and in the winter it's minus 30, so you'd best find a cozy chair and a good book in the evenings.\n\nAside from that, maybe we can haul up the stereotypes and talk about our (self-perceived) reserved and quiet temperaments, combined with a romantic taste for the simple and understated: typography certainly fits the bill.\n\n"
