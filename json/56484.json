  "content": "After the release of DTL FontMaster 2.7.0 a couple of months ago, a _Light_ version is now available also from the [DTL FontTools](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106074411/http:/www.fonttools.org/) web site.\n\nRelease notes can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106074411/http:/www.fontmaster.nl/english/Release.html#release_FM). FM 2.7.0 supports the AFDKO 2.0 (already an update is in production that will support the latest AFDKO version 2.5, like DTL OTMaster does).\n\nThe kit for running the Windows version of FM in a 'Wine bottle' under CrossOver for OS X (actually X11) or Linux has been updated also. At the Dutch Type Library the 'Wine bottles' have proven to form very fast and stable environments for running FM.\n\n",
