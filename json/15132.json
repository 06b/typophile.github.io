  "content": "Hi,\n\ni am looking for a cleaner alternative to American Typewriter light.\n\nAs you can see in the attached graphic file, the original lettershapes (left) have a slight organic feel to them - small bumbs and a degree of unevenness, but i am after a font that has all the characteristics of the American Typewriter light except that it is ’straightend’ (right example in the attached graphic).\n\nThankful for any ideas,\n\nSeb\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [american.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090710050336/http:/typophile.com/files/american.gif) | 2.83 KB |\n\n",

It has some of the same qualities as American Typewriter in terms of proportions and feel, though it doesn’t have the rounded corners and stroke endings and has simpler details.\n\n"
