Can anyone of you?\n\nI like the attitude, like it's something of a medieval piece of text, something like that.

The places you left open, are just those letters which i changed a bit, that is to say i replaced the dotted ascenders into regular ones:\n\nh - d - b\n\nAlso the x is different in the second sample.\n\nEventually, i wanted to create a readable bitmap font, in the smallest grid possible.  \n(well, the first sample isn't readable at all without introduction, i know, but it was just a false topic start).\n\nThis font requires a maximal grid of 7 x 5 (h x w), seems quite small to me.\n\nThere is, by principle, no meeting of horizontal and vertical lines, in order to keep the letterforms 'open'. (that's why i changed the shape of x).\n\nBy the way, the first sample is medieval Dutch; the first 2 lines of Van den Vos Reynaerde (Reynaert the Fox).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070925im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC04104_5890.JPG)\n\n"
