  "content": "Summer is here and we feel it would be nice with a new typeface release.  \nSo with no further ado we give you – **Orbe** designed by **[Rui Abreu](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010232800/http:/www.fountain.nu/designers/ruiabreu.asp)**.\n\nTake a peek at:  \n [http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/orbe.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010232800/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/orbe.asp)\n\nRui has also made a nice promotion video:  \n [http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/orbe\\_video.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010232800/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/orbe_video.asp)\n\nDownload PDF:  \n [http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/img/pdf/FTN\\_Orbe.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010232800/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/img/pdf/FTN_Orbe.pdf \"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/img/pdf/FTN\\_Orbe.pdf\")\n\nOrbe is a blackletter font intended to interpret the feel of Portuguese calligraphy. It's name, the portuguese for \"orb\" or \"globe\", evokes the enclosed beauty and consistency of shapes that naturally cohere in the calligraphic expression.\n\nWith a light and spontaneous feel, it's also exotic with it's flourished details, which makes it a very nice decorative and titling font. The glyphs are a mix of lowercases and uppercases, all aligned at same height, as if the uppercase forms of some letters evolved by speed of gesture to lowercase forms.\n\nThis is Fountain's first OpenType release and features a full CE supported character set, and fancy ligatures.\n\nAbout Fountain:  \nFountain is an independent and friendly digital type foundry based in Malmö, Sweden. We've been sending out nice typefaces to the world since 1993.\n\n",
