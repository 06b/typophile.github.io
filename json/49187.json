But since I don't have specimens for lead fonts, the closest one I could compare was \"Skeleton Antique\", from the book American Wood Type:1828-1900. Please notice the slight changes. It is possible that the font was re-designed as it was converted to lead-type.\n\nSkeleton Antique. By William Page in his 1865 specimens.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822231709im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Skeleton_Antique_6141.jpg)\n\n"
