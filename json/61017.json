I am going to dive right on in and see if I can get some professional, honest feedback on a custom lettering mark I am working on for a logo.\n\nI want some good feedback on any and all typographic rules, spacing, weight consistancy etc. Just let me have it.\n\nI am at the point right now where I know its not perfect, but would like to receive feedback before I move forward. right now the a, e, and s bother me a bit.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804224827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/franers_5566.jpg)\n\n",
