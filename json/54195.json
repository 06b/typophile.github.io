Like Stockxpert, iStockPhoto, Jupiterimages etc.  \nRoyalty-free images are available from very low prices actually, and such vendors tend to have large selections. Plus you'd be sure to be on the safe side legally (be sure to read the licence agreements).  \nThere are also some free stock sources (of course pix are of varying quality there), such as Stockxchange (sxc.hu).\n\n"
