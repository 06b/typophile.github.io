      "content": "My comment about the 'generic' sans was just that almost any sans would have a W like that. I also think if you were to ask almost anyone to draw a W, that is the shape you would get -- so in that sense it is 'generic' too.\n\nMy other point in mentioning 50 years, is that the photo is clearly from a pre-digital era, so font, the way most of us use it isn't so applicable. Many pre-digital typefaces were never made into digital fonts.\n\nI hope that helps explain my remarks.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
