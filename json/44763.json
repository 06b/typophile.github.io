There may not be enough information for a exact match but if a font name jumps to mind it would be appreciated.\n\nI realize both of these samples could be custom hand drawn letters and not part of font but if what you see suggests a font I would appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [truck\\_type\\_sample\\_01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062321/http:/typophile.com/files/truck_type_sample_01.jpg) | 81.86 KB |\n| [truck\\_type\\_sample\\_02.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062321/http:/typophile.com/files/truck_type_sample_02.jpg) | 118.02 KB |\n\n [‹ 'Shattered' Font ID](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062321/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44781 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for a free alternative for Schwung by Hubert Jocham ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062321/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44747 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
