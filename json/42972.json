  "content": "So I’m having this issue, where I just installed a typeface, but instead of every weight being nested within one typeface family, every weight has it’s own name within the character menu of both indesign, and illustrator. The result is I end up having a long list of fonts from the same typeface instead of just the family name, so it gets all mucked up, and I want it to be organized correctly. I took a screenshot of what I’m talking about.\n\nSo does anyone have a solution to this problem, or is there any software out there that can fix it?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083746im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/myproblem_6641.jpg)\n\n [‹ FL5 Class kerning pop-up grey always?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083746/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43270 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [How do I shake the blues?

It’s a font’s [name] table which is making trouble. You’ll need software, which will dig into this table (e.g., a&nbsp;font editor) and then you’ll have to change it’s entries manually. I doubt there would be an automatic solution. There are some free font editors out there, like [FontForge](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083746/http:/fontforge.sourceforge.net/), which supports OpenType fonts.\n\n"

(They’re used to cache information so that the product doesn’t have to open up every font during startup. They’re also just text files and you can read them with any text editor.) So, to be clear, the file name is AdobeFntxx.lst where xx is a 2 digit number. On Windows you would search for AdobeFnt\\*.lst. The number is incremented when the format of the file changes. For InDesign 2.0 the number was 06, CS was 07, CS2 was 10, CS3 was 11.\n\n"
