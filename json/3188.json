Simple as that! It's also hard to ignore a successful typeface like Fontesque from our pal Nick Shinn up in Canada. It's become an incredibly popular display face in the US.   \n   \nI guess a great typeface is a great typeface and I'd personally be reluctant to go out of my way to find a \"local\" homerolled version of something that already is exactly what I want.   \n   \nThat's my opinion when it comes to purchasing type. Regarding other products I purchase, I think I may have a bias due to regionality, relationship to my personal background, etc. - less 'legitimate' reasons and more 'gut' reasons.   \n   \nHopefully I'm not going too far into a tangent, but I think my purchase decisions are based mostly on historical purchase experiences, sense of value for amount paid, packaging/ambiance, and cost.\n\n"
