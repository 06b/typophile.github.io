  "content": "Interesting article about color perception, titled \"Is my red your red?\"\n\n[http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/050526\\_colorfrm.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20130529080759/http:/www.world-science.net/exclusives/050526_colorfrm.htm \"http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/050526\\_colorfrm.htm\")\n\nThe chart is interesting, since I didn't agree with most of the average \"best representation\" dots of each color. It was done in '72, maybe that's why.\n\nMy norms, based on my monitor: Red - up one from shown dot. Orange - down a square. Blue & Yellow - one to the right.\n\n",
