(MacWEEK, 17-MAR-97, p. 1) It's not pleasant to have to report, but Adobe knew what it was doing. They desperately wanted MT and Bitstream to be declared 'broken'.

Adam Twardoch states,\n\n'The kerning lookup(s) in Arno Pro are so complex that the decompiler in FontLab Studio fails to interpret the code for it. But of course kerning is in there.'\n\nIt is just as I feared. Adobe has broken Fontlab. Again.\n\nNow I cannot remember Yuri or Adam ever whining to me about Adobe giving them adequate support. That's not the Russian way, that's not the Polish way.\n\nBut Macromedia whined! Adobe never gave Fog adequate MM support. Application developers whined by the hundreds: Adobe never gave them adequate MM support. The type group is so paranoid and so arrogant that it never even gave Adobe's own app developers adequate MM support, which is why it took Apple and Lari Software, together, to provide adequate MM support, briefly, around the mid-90s. And why is it so few programs -- certainly neither Fog nor Flag -- still -- can do intermediate masters?\n\nAnd when ATM Deluxe for Mac came out, and the Monotype and Bitstream libraries -- which up until then had worked impeccably -- were pronounced 'broken', Bitstream and Monotype didn't whine, they howled. Especially when Adobe didn't fix the problem. Even Microsoft has been bruised by Adobe's intransigence.\n\nWhy? Because Adobe at the gut level believes in proprietary standards.\n\nJohn Warnock cried in public when he was forced to announce Type 1 would no longer be private -- soon after TrueType was announced. Nothing has changed since then.\n\nThe Adobe type group historically does everything it can to keep as much type technology private as it can, whilst guiltily promoting its open-ness at every opportunity.\n\nNick, I have tried Arno in Quark 7.31 and can replicate your problem. But I don't see the problem with any other of a dozen OT fonts I have tried. It looks like it's Arno that broke Fontlab and Quark.\n\nTypical! How many designers said they'd never print with MMs because their service bureaus couldn't output the type? Adobe always said, 'old driver, old rasterizer. It's not our problem.' Like hell it's not your problem . . .\n\nSomehow Apple managed to get all this right in GX in 1995 without breaking anything. Type really does need to be more integrated with the OS.\n\n"

      "content": "Bill, extension format lookups are part of the OpenType spec and have been for a long time. If Quark or anyone else doesn't support them, that's an app bug or limitation not a problem with the fonts or any kind of conspiracy. The extension format is necessary when lookups get so big that they overflow the 16bit offset limit. While Arno might be unique among Adobe fonts in having an extension GPOS kern lookup, such lookups are far from uncommon in complex script fonts. I use them regularly. They are not only supported in Adobe apps but also by all Microsoft's OT Layout engines and, I suspect, by the various open source layout engines (ICU, Pango etc.). If it doesn't work in Quark apps, that's evidence that Quark is still lagging when it comes to OpenType layout.\n\nWord 2007 does not support any GPOS kerning for either TTF or CFF fonts, so for CFF fonts it relies on a blackbox on-the-fly conversion of a subset of kerning, which is now several years old. It is possible that this conversion doesn't know how to handle extension lookups. Again, this is not a bug in the font but a limitation in an older piece of software (and more generally a limitation of Word in failing to support GPOS kerning).\n\nWith regard to problems with FontLab being unable to decompile some aspects of OTL tables -- and kern extension lookups are hardly unique in this regard -- this is due to a combination of factors. It is important to realise, and remember, that FontLab probably never decompiles OTL tables to a source that corresponds one-to-one with the original source for the font, even if that original source was also a FontLab file. What FontLab tries to do is to decompile the tables in a way that provides, within the limitations of the version of AFDKO syntax that they use, equivalent results, i.e. what you get is reverse engineered output not reconstruction of the original input. If a font is pretty simple, FontLab can do a reasonable job at this and you might end up with something that you can recompile. I've never had any luck with this, but then my fonts tend not to be simple. Also bear in mind that FontLab still uses an earlier version of the AFKDO code for OTL; I presume that Arno was made using either the current AFKDO or that Adobe needed to update their internal tools in order to be able to produce this font.\n\nVOLT has had an option to use extension lookups since v1.2 (January 2006), and also to use PairPosFormat2, which is another thing that may not be supported by FontLab/AFDKO either in terms of decompiling or compiling.\n\nSo 'what is really going on here' is that Adobe have made a font following the published font format specification. So rather than saying 'Adobe should build fonts that work with contemporary products', I would say that contemporary products should support contemporary text layout, especially when that layout is part of an ISO standard specification.\n\n"

Exquisitely reasoned, but fatally wrong. We're talking about fonts here, and if a font doesn't work with just about everything out there, it's broken. If it doesn't work with Word, it's broke. If it doesn't work with Quark, it's broke.\n\nAdobe applied precisely the same reasoning that you have here to its defense of ATM Deluxe for Mac. They said, basically, the entire Monotype and Bitstream libraries 'don't follow the published font specification.'\n\nSo what happened? The fonts are still with us -- unchanged, still working. ATM Deluxe for Mac is gone.\n\nLook, I appreciate your viewpoint: in an ideal world, apps improve to meet new demands.\n\nBut your approach is way too ivory tower for this world. A font's just a font. It's got to work with apps that people are using every day that might be a decade old. Maybe one day the apps will be updated. But the user base never will be. And it's for users we build fonts.\n\nThat's why we test 'em. And if they don't work with Word, we don't publish 'em until they do work.\n\nSeriously, what would happen if Microsoft released a font that didn't work with Word and Quark?\n\nThis is the daffiest manufacturing situation I have yet encountered with an Adobe font. I guess David Lemon isn't doing testing anymore. Surely he'd never allow something like this. Tell me it ain't so!\n\n"

And then they log the bug on their bug tracking system and either it gets addressed by the relevant group (MST or Office) -- perhaps not immediately, perhaps only in the next major system or app release -- or a decision is made to live with the bug if there are concerns about backwards compatibility or document reflow. Over the past few years, my font work has resulted in the overhaul of the entire Uniscribe Hebrew layout engine, and the acknowledgement and/or fixing of numerous bugs in Word's kerning support, and that's just the stuff I'm allowed to talk about. Over on the Typophile Arabic SIG page there is a report of a major bug in WPF's Arabic mark-to-ligature handling, which this morning is being investigated by WPF developers at MS. And what is consistently the case in all these is that the font has been made according to the specification, and the app or layout engine is doing something wrong.\n\nYou need to get your head out of the Latin-centric graphic design world in which a 'font's just a font' that is expected to be compromised to accommodate limitations or bugs in application support. To Microsoft a font is an enabling technology for users to compute in their own languages, and hence a key to new markets. This is why MST is part of the MS internationalisation group. The work MST does supports font use across the whole range of MS products, but their core business is script and language support.\n\nI suppose if the only font you ever encountered with a GPOS extension lookup were Arno Pro, it might seem like a big deal. But as I said _extension lookups have been part of the OpenType specification for a long time_ and they are used in a lot of other fonts. They just happen to be fonts that you don't encounter and that Quark doesn't even pretend to support. This is not some new or unknown technology that Adobe have capriciously decided to use in one font family, it is a well documented and reasonably common aspect of OpenType for the better part of a decade.\n\nQuark has a history, during this same period, of first not grasping the importance of multibyte character encoding (I was at the Unicode conference when they announced that there were sticking to 8-bit codepages) and then playing catch-up by implementing a virtual clone of InDesign 1.0 OTL support and never pushing much beyond that. I presume they test only with relatively simple Latin OT fonts, have not encountered any fonts with extension lookups, and presumed that this was something they could postpone supporting. Actually, now I think about it, _how does Quark do kerning?_ -- are they actually supporting GPOS kerning at all or are they, like Word, doing an on-the-fly conversion to old-style kern pair data?\n\n"

      "content": "Re. Alex Kaczun's comment about 200 kern pairs:\n\nHe was presumably talking about an 8-bit set of \\<256 glyphs (219 in the standard Windows Latin 1 codepage). Kerning is factorial, since adjacency means that there is a potential need for kerning between any unique pair of glyphs. This means that the potential number of kern pairs in a font increases exponentially with an increase in the number of glyphs: _n!_\n\nArno Pro Regular contains 2,845 glyphs. Now, obviously not every glyph is expected to occur adjacent to every other glyph, nor is the maker of the font likely to consider every problematic adjacency to be a high priority. So let's consider Kaczun's proposed 200 kern per c.219 glyphs, and how that scales to 2,845 glyphs. The actual potential number of kern pairs in 219 glyphs -- _219!_ -- is\n\n1.038118334506655207907848120507 **e+419**\n\n[Remember that the exponent equals the number of decimal places the . needs to travel to the right (+) or left (-) in order to write the number out in full. So imagine the above number without the decimal point and with 389 zeros after it. Actually, no, don't imagine it. It looks like this:\n\n103,811,833,450,665,520,790,784,812,050,700,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00,00,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00,00,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000]\n\nYes, that many. Which means that 200 kern pairs equals an infintesimal fraction of the total number of potential kern pairs:\n\n1.9265626408095948382249858301366 **e-415** %\n\nThe factorial of 2845 is the staggeringly huge\n\n2.6448619317498636060239040786471 **e+8593**\n\nIf we presume a similarly limited and constrained set of kerning as a percentage of that number, we end up with\n\n5.0954921878087836162237868848158 **e+8176** kern pairs\n\nTo put this in some kind of perspective, consider that the circumference of the earth is 18,933,146,496 picas. This means that, presuming an average glyph width of half an en (which is actually a bit narrower than the average width of glyphs in Arno Pro Regular), if you were to typeset the above kerning glyph pairs in 12pt type it would stretch around the world\n\n2.691307643388966896537442227804 **e+8166** times\n\nOh, so that's not much easier to imagine. But that's the nature of factorial calculations, and that is why throwing around arbitrary numbers like 200 as the maximum number of kern pairs any font needs is silly. One thing that is very clear from the numbers above is that, as a percentage of the possible number of kern pairs relative to glyph set size, the kerning in Arno Pro Regular is much _more limited and constrained_ than Kaczun's dictum.\n\nI wonder what the expanded number of pair kerning in Arno Pro Regular is? To provide even reasonable kerning for a glyph set of more than a couple of hundred typical roman letter shapes requires class-based kerning technologies. Even so, you'd better be damn sure that the basic spacing is as good and efficient as it can be. I am working on kerning a display font with 4,517 glyphs, and even with strict limitations against cross-script kerning and use of contextual alternates to improve fit and avoid adjacency spacing problems, the number of expanded kern pairs is about 340,000.\\* But the number of class plus exception kerning pairs is less than 10,000, and I think I can probably whittle it down further.\n\n\\*Which is pretty small considering that the potential number of pairs is  \n2.9936932664428451861273182257307 **e+14549**\n\n"

If Quark are offering anything like cross-platform parity in layout behaviour, then you can be pretty sure that they are also using their own OTL engine and not relying on system resources.\n\nNow, if Adobe is guilty of anything with regard to OTL engines, it is the same thing that everyone else is guilty of: partial implementation of the OT spec. Even Microsoft, who are so far ahead of everyone else in terms of what they support, don't handle everything that is in the spec, in their layout engines or in their tools: they just support a lot more than anyone else. My big complaint against Adobe, which I know they're tired of hearing -- and which I also know they are addressing --, is lack of support for one-to-many substitutions in their core text engines. I'm not paying very close attention to Quark, since they are not a significant entity in the market segment in which I operate, but obviously I would consider lack of support for extension lookup types to be an unwelcome limitation.\n\nI'm sorry, but your comments about 'proprietary font technology' really don't stand up. This is an ISO standard, Bill. The extension lookup types have been publicly documented since at least 2002. If using these lookup types indicates an attraction to proprietary font technology, then I'm way more guilty than Adobe, since I've used these lookup types for longer and in more projects. And so, I suspect, have plenty of my colleagues dealing with complex scripts. [If you want to blame someone for the existence of extension lookups, I suggest you start with Apple, since they are the people who defined the entire sfnt font format around 16bit assumptions, and hence made such mechanisms necessary.]\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \nThis is one of those discussions in which I have said everything that I want to say, and in which I am only likely to repeat myself going forward. In concluding, I'll note that my perspective is anything but 'ivory tower'. I comment from the rock face, and I do consider it the proper business of app developers to build roads through behind me to the place where I am blasting. :)\n\n"

You yourself have noted elsewhere that parts of the OT standard which don't work should be discarded.\n\n3. A font, no matter how complex, is never perceived by the vast majority of users as anything but a tiny functional widget that always works and never causes problems.\n\n4. For Adobe to release a font that only works with its own apps is like Sony releasing a CD that only plays on Sony players.\n\n5. It is possible for Adobe to make Arno work with existing software. They have chosen not to do so.\n\n6. It is thus clear that Adobe is trying to seek competitive advantage. The message is that if you want quality fonts going forward, you'll have to use Adobe fonts only. Unfortunately, the font isn't compelling enough, technologically or aesthetically, to make anyone care. But Adobe has always tried to push the message that \\_only\\_ its fonts give reliable, professional, output.\n\n7. It is significant that Adobe has had to give this Trojan away. Of course. Nobody would actually buy it. To get a Trojan to work, you have to get the Trojan to spread. So you give it away.\n\n"

And it's completely untrue. Arno Pro's kerning does, indeed, not work. It isn't nonsense.\n\nThe font doesn't work in Quark and Word 2007 and Publisher, and neither, probably, in the majority of Windows applications that do kerning. More testing would reveal this - - or Adobe, which has obviously done the testing, could simply come clean and publish a list of applications which it knows are broken by Arno Pro.\n\nMaybe it works in TextEdit -- if so, that's a tribute to the GX-derived OS support. Yet Apple isn't even a co-developer of OT. MS and Adobe are. And MS doesn't believe in putting the depth of font support at OS level that Apple does. It's a justifiable though very expensive position to take.\n\nIn any case, a major selling point of OT fonts is that they're cross-platform compatible. It looks like this one is only partially cross-platform compatible.\n\nFinally, to those who take exception to the Trojan analogy, let me put it this way: if Arno were not a Trojan, Adobe would have said, upfront, when they released it, 'this font only works with apps x and y; it doesn't work with Quark, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Publisher', etc. etc.\n\nWhen did Adobe provide any such advisory?

Otherwise we’d have had it in Word and Publisher long ago._\n\nEvery single Microsoft OTL layout engine supports extension format lookups. I have made plenty of fonts that use this format, and they all work fine in Word. The issue for Word with Arno Pro kerning is not the extension format lookup per se, which it would have no difficulty supporting for kerning in any Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, Thai or other complex script font. The issue for Word is twofold:\n\n1. Word does not employ any OpenType kerning at all for non-complex scripts. For TTF fonts, this means that there is no kerning at all for the Latin script unless that kerning is included as old-fashioned kern table pair kerning (either in addition to or instead of OTL GPOS kerning in the font). For CFF (PS OT) fonts, since these are by design not supposed to include kern tables, Word -- like various other Windows apps -- must rely on on-the-fly conversion of GPOS to virtual kern table kerning. Since it is risky to present any application with fully expanded class kerning, since many have undocumented limits in kerning support, this conversion involves subsetting kerning for specific 8-bit codepages.\n\n2. Such kern data conversion is performed in Windows, as I understand it, by a quite old piece of code in a blackbox mechanism provided by Adobe (probably originally written for ATM). Because this code was presumably written before the OT extension lookup format was defined and added to the font format specification, it not surprisingly doesn't know how to handle Arno Pro. That, at least, is my analysis of the likely cause of the kerning failure in Word.\n\nBill, I frankly don't much care if you want to chastise Adobe for deciding to ship a font that uses a mechanism that is not universally supported in current applications. It seems churlish to me, because pretty much every font I ship only works fully in a small number of current apps, and I expect fonts and apps to develop in tandem, but I know that I'm unlikely to dissuade you, after all these years. But I do care that in your crusade you don't misrepresent or muddle technical facts, because people actually rely on technical information to make a living and form decisions about time and resources. If you want to attempt to deduce reasons -- however unlikely they may seem to me -- why Adobe might have decided to use a particular technology in a particular font, go ahead.

I'm not sure about 7 but I can't find any way of making it work in 7.\n\nHere's what Quark says assuming you are using 8:\n\n_We took a close look at the kerning differences we see in the screen  \nshot of the differences between QXP 8 and Indesign. When we created a  \nnew project in QXP 8 and ensured \"Use OpenType Kerning\" was ON, using  \nthe same Arnold Pro Regular font at 48 pt., the kerning relationships in  \nQuarkXPress 8 were exactly the same as in InDesign. However, when we  \nturned OFF Use OpenType Kerning, we ended up with the same results as  \nthe link shows. This tells us that QuarkXPress 8 is working as designed  \nand is correctly reading the built-in kerning tables for the OpenType  \nfont._\n\nThis leads to one of two possibilities:\n\nIf this behavior is occurring in a brand new project created from  \nscratch, and Use OpenType Kerning is showing as ON in the QuarkXPress  \nPreferences, then the XPress Preferences are damaged. Essentially what  \noften happens with Preference-level damage is that a setting will show  \nas ON when it is actually OFF. The remedy is to quit out of QuarkXPress  \n8 and create a new folder in the QuarkXPress 8 folder, naming it  \n\"Preferences\". Then create a new project and ensure Use OpenType Kerning  \nis ON. Then see what happens with the Arnold Pro Regular font-It will  \nlikely show the correct OpenType kerning.\n\nIf it is occurring in a legacy file, i.e., one that was created in  \nversion 6.5 or earlier, these versions did not support OpenType kerning,  \nand, in order to preserve the text flow, QuarkXPress 8 will by default  \nfor legacy files like this turn Use OpenType Kerning OFF for that file  \nonly. If you want to force the file to flow using OpenType Kerning, go  \nto File\\>Open. In the Open dialog highlight the file. Then hold down the  \nControl and Option keys and click open. This will rewrite the file into  \nQXP 8 text flow code (along with rewriting the entire file to QXP 8 file  \nstructure), which should tell QXP to turn Use OpenType Kerning ON.\n\nThis confirms my experience. Any new project in Quark 8 will work fine. If you're bringing an old Arno document over from 7, though, you will have to ctrl-opt-click Open. (Mac)\n\nI can't help noticing the difference between Quark's genial, informative tone and Adobe's\n\n_’We, the Adobe Type Group, definitely have better things to do with our time ... no reason for it not to work in QuarkXPress ... Your concerns about Arno Pro’s kerning have no ground...stop wasting my time with nonsense....’_\n\nIn an earlier post here, Nick Shinn defends Adobe's kerning of A right quote comma, but here,\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/node/39130](http://web.archive.org/web/20150330054001/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39130 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/39130\")\n\nAdobe's Sousa writes, with what I can only take to be superbly Freudian cynicism,\n\n_Please do. I’ll make sure these bugs get logged, and will certainly be fixed next time the fonts get revised. No need to post them here. You can send the material directly to me at msousa adobe.com_\n\nWhat would be nice is if you could post a list of unusual kerning combinations, like the quote/quote examples you’ve just provided. This type of thing should actually be posted on the Wiki. If you don’t know how to do that, just start a new thread.\n\nMark this - - Adobe promises these fonts will certainly be fixed the next time they get revised.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, place your bets!\n\nWhile we're waiting, perhaps we, too, can spend the next 20 years posting a list of unusual kerning examples on the Wiki. If you don't know how, just start a new thread!\n\nFinally, Nick - - are you at the point with Quark 7 that you can't get _any_ OT font to kern properly? If so, check, as described above, that OT Kern preferences are on; if fonts other than Arno still don't work, in new documents, then you may have to trash preferences, but for a definitive answer, it would be best to give Quark more information. Please let us know in detail, if you have the time, how you are getting on with this.\n\nJust in the past couple of days, a paradoxical situation has arisen for me. I generated a very simple OT font for a designer which includes extra f-ligatures, nothing more. I followed Fontlab's instructions to the letter. The ligatures work in Quark 8, but not in InDesign CS3!!!! So here we have an instance where Quark's handling of OT is better than Adobe's.\n\nI'm afraid that highlights the weakness of OpenType - - the standard is so broadly written (when I say broadly I mean badly but I am trying to be polite) that nobody can ever be sure which feature, implemented which way, will work in what program.\n\nThis after a decade of OT ? Akkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!\n\nMy sympathies are with the MS app developers on this . . . . OT is so leaky it's like a moving target.\n\n"

I am also sure that you are quoting Quark as manipulative and selective as you are quoting Adobe in this thread.
