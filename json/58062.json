I would like to try and ID the typeface used on this vintage jewelry we found when doing some image research for an idea we have for a board - i know that it has had some treatment by giving it the swoosh underline, can anyone throw some light on which was the original typeface? Is it a set of characters with a swashes?\n\nThanks again as always, typophile hasnâ€™t let us down yet!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090522223311/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_251.png) | 98.26 KB |\n\n",
