Maybe the programmers do read stuff on the bug list, but there aren’t as many responses as there are bug reports, and so the same bugs get reported over and over.\n\nApparently the size limit is 60 x 60. I don’t know if it was that size before or not; in any case an avatar still worked if it was slightly over. One of the benefits of the redesign is forced compliance (truncation).\n\n"

He Is regarded as the universal symbol of fertility for all life, be it crops, hopes, dreams, or love. The first known images of him appear on Hohokam pottery dated to sometime between AD 750 and AD 850. He is also a trickster god and represents the spirit of music.\n\nSorry to let it go, but Kokopelli suffered severely by the new avatar size enforcement, and I tried reducing it to the required 60 x 60 but my results were too fuzzy and jaggy and weren’t very clear. If I knew how to keep the resolution at a reduced size, I’d go back to using it again.\n\nMy new avatar is the logo I use on my newsletter _ **&cetera** _ and symbolizes my belief that heart-smart and head-smart both count, but heart-smart counts more. Thanks for noticing, Mili.\n\n"

It’s time to redo mine. I did it as an understated visual pun around the time the first drupal redesign happened, but I think it has served its term. All these little patches of color are so happy, like a flower garden. I’ll see if I find some inspiration soon.\n\n"

When you think about it, the conventional binocular “g” is too complex to fit with the rest of the alphabet; it’s almost like a Chinese logograph. We -and readers- might not notice a problem most of the time, but especially when it’s doubled, it can jump out. The open-bottom one is a much more harmonious and functional solution. Danm shame most designers who use it do it merely for fashion though.\n\nhhp\n\n"
