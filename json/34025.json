I can dig into deeper with this, cause I know I have read about it somewhere, who designed these shirts (I dont believe it’s a swede at all but the clothing company that produces the clothes). When these sweaters were first seen, almost anyone I know felt it was an embarrasing bad design.\n\nI guess the football-lobbyists havent understood what design is all about. cos I never seen a good swedish national clothes outfit in modern ages yet... and I am swedish... (but doesn’t play football)\n\nIf I find the article I will post it here, so whoever did it can be ashamed ;-)\n\n"
