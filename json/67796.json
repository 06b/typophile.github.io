I'm a design student working on a film festival poster right now for Jean-Luc Godard. My logo type uses [Poster Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416043821/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/poster-sans/) and I was trying to find a supporting typeface or family that pairs well with it, preferably sans serif (which I understand is hard to do successfully). I really appreciate it!\n\n-Nick\n\n",
