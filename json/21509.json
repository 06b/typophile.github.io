The problem didn’t previously occur as the previous set of fonts we used had an additional Euro sign in the 00A4 position.\n\nAny assistance appreciated.\n\nElliot\n\n [‹ Japanese Fonts in Illustrator CS2/OSX](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016222935/http:/typophile.com/node/21482 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The oldest? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016222935/http:/typophile.com/node/21458 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
