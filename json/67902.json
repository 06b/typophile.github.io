  "content": "OK, so I know these guys have been controversial, but they have great fonts and they appear to have come to a reasonable conclusion on the DRM thing.\n\nBut they have this annoying habit of introducing some killer fonts, and then having them just disappear within a week or two, and they won't even discuss why or give you any possible way of getting ahold of the now non-existent font.\n\nOne such typeface is the truly amazing 'United Cigar' font, which an awful lot of work went into and then \\>pow\\< it vanished from the site in a very short time. Like a big tease. I should have bought it when I had the chance, but LHF discontinued it pretty quickly -- I wonder why? It makes NO sense! Does anybody know where I can get a copy of this font? It must surely exist SOMEPLACE, right? I'd prefer to have bought it legitimately but LHF simply refuses to even discuss it at this point. The have wonderful fonts but they're a very weird company. If anybody knows Dave Parr or otherwise has an 'in' on how I can get ahold of this font, please let me know -- I'm not seeking a free ride here; I really need it, and I'll be happy to pay for it!  \nB\n\n[xwhys@yahoo.com](mailto:xwhys@yahoo.com)\n\n",

Very helpful and supportive.\n\nWhy don't you just write Chuck and ask him?\n\nAs far as being controversial, I think most of the debate has been around their copy protection scheme. My view is that Chuck is just trying to protect his intellectual property. The DRM doesn't affect the functionality of the fonts at all. If DRM can keep artists producing, I'm all for it.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the great advice. No such luck, however. Chuck was gracious and did respond promptly and personally, with a note saying that sometimes they discontinue fonts due to low popularity or if he just decides they aren't up to par (and in those cases he usually will send the font for free to the requestor) -- BUT in this case, apparently they had some sort of licensing standoff with the font designer and so they gave up, and the font isn't available to them at all anymore. It was up there for sale for a short time (like a week), but now it's gone -- so I KNOW somebody out there has it.\n\nI don't suppose I could ask someone to pirate it though, even if it's not available for sale and so nobody's losing the money (all I would need would be the alphabet turned into outlines in Illustrator and I'd be fine with that -- is that technically pirating?). But anyway. If there IS some generous soul out there who managed to procure this particular font (again, 'United Cigar'), who might be willing to send me outlines so I can get this project done (OR if someone knows the font designer and can put me in touch with them, as Letterhead couldn't), I'd be eternally grateful.  \nB\n\n[xwhys@yahoo.com](mailto:xwhys@yahoo.com)\n\n"
