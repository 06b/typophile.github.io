His father, [Linn Boyd Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linn%20Boyd%20Benton), was a type-founder and the inventor of the matrix-cutting machine, which revolutionised printing. The son graduated as a mechanical engineer from [Cornell](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cornell) and went to work with his father in the newly established type design department of the [American Type Founders](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/American%20Type%20Founders) Company. He went on to become the most prolific designer in America, producing more than 180 types of great diversity. Despite all this, he is less well known today than his contemporary [Frederic W. Goudy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frederic%20W.%20Goudy). However, his types have been much digitized and revived, especially by [Font Bureau](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Bureau).\n\nMorris was the chief type designer of the ATF from 1900 to 1937, and designed a great many typefaces, ranging from revivals of historical originals, such as [Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Garamond) and [Bodoni](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bodoni), to new faces of existing fonts such as [Goudy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Goudy) and [Cheltenham](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cheltenham), to strikingly bold and original designs such as [Hobo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hobo), [Stymie](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Stymie), and [Broadway](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Broadway). In addition, his \"gothics\" such as [Franklin Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Franklin%20Gothic) and [Alternate Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Alternate%20Gothic) are much more similar to modern sans-serif fonts such as [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) than the crude, [grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/grotesque) versions of his contemporaries.\n\nMorris has been credited with 221 type designs including: Adscript, Alternate Gothic, Announcement, American Backslant, Benton, Bold Antique, Broadway, Canterbury, [Century](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Century) Old Style, [Century](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Century) Expanded, [Century](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Century) Schoolbook, Chic, Clearface Gothic, [Cloister Oldstyle](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cloister%20Oldstyle), Commercial Script, Dynamic, Empire, Engravers, Engravers Text, [Franklin Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Franklin%20Gothic), Freehand, Gravure, Greeting Monotone, Headline Gothic,Invitation, Light OldStyle, Miehle Gothic, Modernique, Norwood Roman, Novel Gothic, Parisian, Raleigh Gothic Condensed, Roycroft, Shadow, Rugged Roman, [Sterling](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Sterling), [Souvenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Souvenir), Thermotype, Typo Script, Typo Roman, Venetian, Wedding Text.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Morris Fuller Benton and \"Yankee Eclecticism\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/typophile.com/node/39662)\n\n**Links:**  \n [Wikipedia Article: Morris Fuller Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Fuller_Benton)  \n [Myfonts.com Bio: Morris Fuller Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/benton/morris/fuller/)  \n [Sherwinbeach.com New book: Searching for Morris Fuller Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414031423/http:/sherwinbeach.com/new/Benton.php)\n\n",
