      "content": "I'm not sure what you mean by a feng shui font, but if you just need the Chinese characters used in feng shui, you just need a font that supports Chinese (simplified or traditional as desired). If you need the _ba gua_ symbols, then I think many fonts include them as symbols, especially East Asian ones. Japanese fonts are a good bet. There really should be no need to get a dedicated feng shui font, whatever that is.\n\n"
