  "content": "This is my first post EVER but I would like everyone's feedback on a logo i sketched and vectorized: 314\n\nThe 314 logo is for an art studio out of Portland, located in a heavy industrial area of the city. The stencil letterings were inspired from the local trains which cross right in front of the studio.\n\nI feel that the \"3\" needs some editing but im not so sure? The letter is 4 units tall x 4 units wide.\n\nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419210156im_/http:/typophile.com/files/314%20Option%20Showcase_4775.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [314 Option Showcase.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419210156/http:/typophile.com/files/314%20Option%20Showcase.png) | 3.26 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I like the general idea of a stencil lettering (given your particular circumstances), and I can see lots of possibilities for an art studio logo by doing variations with the color having a texture like brush strokes, or color gradations, etc. Also you might experiment with slight rounding of the corners to give it a less rigid look.\n\nBut to me the \"3\" looks like it's got some other character in front of it, and the \"1\" looks like punctuation followed by an \"L\". Tightening up the gaps between character segments may help; they normally are minimal and are just to keep the stencil from falling apart. Below is a quickie example:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419210156im_/http:/typophile.com/files/example2_5478.jpg)\n\nIf you'd like to see many examples of \"314\" in different stencil fonts, go to the page below and enter \"314\" in the \"sample text\" box. Of course you'll want to do something custom and different, but still it might be helpful.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/search/stencil/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419210156/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/stencil/fonts/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/search/stencil/fonts/\")\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your response James. Funny that you should mentioned about \"tightening up the gaps between the character segments.\" I originally had the gaps only .1 units such as you have it displayed but faced problems when it came it to print so I increased it to .2 units.\n\nMy original sketches had rounded corners but for seem reason I abandoned that concept. Ill definitely make some adjustments and repost an updated version asap.\n\nThanks\n\nSG\n\n"

And results will vary depending on paper stock, as some stocks are more absorbent and have more ink spread. Coated (glossy) stock will give the least spread. If you're using an ink-jet printer, most office supply stores also carry reams of premium ink-jet paper which may give better results.\n\n"

      "content": "Stock and printing technique will affect the outcome, but I think predominantly the size of the logo. I think it will be impossible to find the right distance of the gaps for all sizes. If I were you I would make 2 variants; one for big to regular use and one for small applications and less desirable printing methods.\n\nFor the small version I would decrease the gaps a bit more than your original and for the regular version I would get a bit closer to the \"after\" picture. Also, I think by decreasing the width of /3 you also avoid the resemblance of a /3 with some character in front of it. I think your current 3 is simply too wide.\n\n"
