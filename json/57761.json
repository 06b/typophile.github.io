If this thread was called “AIR - WORLD’S LARGEST” we would all know which one to come back to with our answer.\n\nWe don’t always get the answer at first glace, and so sometimes we have to go hunt for a while and then come back and try to find the thread. I can’t tell you how many times I have had to search through the posts looking for the one I found an answer for, but couldn’t find because there was nothing about the title that told me which problem I was answering.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

In this case, something along the lines of ‘decorated caps with stars, stripes, bulges; Wild West/Circus style.  \nb) Mention the source, date and media (if known). Could be ‘Mumbai leaflet’ or ‘French poster from the 1970s’ or ‘Headline type on www.example.org’.  \nc) Always helpful, in addition to a) and b): Type out the literal letters/lines in your sample: ‘AIR - WORLD’S LARGEST’.  \nThanks!\n\n"
