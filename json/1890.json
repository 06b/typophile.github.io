Unfortunately, the rip does not like the MM or open type format, so I try to convert the original font in fontlab v.4. to a type 1 font. I have a hard time adding more than one font to a suitcase. Any suggestions?   \nThanks a lot!\n\n",

I have output the files to type 1 and having lots of problems outputting them. sometimes they default to courier sometimes they dont. OSX seems to recognise some of the fonts but not all of them. im pulling my hair out.\n\n"

We plan to release a version of TransType later this year that will handle that, but at the moment, our only product that can convert OpenType PS (.otf) fonts to Type 1 fonts is FontLab 4.6.   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam Twardoch   \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"

      "content": "I'm sure most of these folks are long gone, but most and perhaps all of these kinds of problems are generally due to incorrect system software configurations (ATM version, driver version, etc.) and are not intrinsic in the fonts themselves.   \n   \nPeople having these sorts of problems should first consult the OpenType readme, at [http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101124926/http:/www.adobe.com/type/opentype).   \n   \nOn the off chance these folks are still around, I will pose some specific questions....   \n   \nPeter:   \n   \nMore information please. As far as we are aware, there are no known printing compatibility issues involving normal RIPs and OpenType. What model of RIP, and most importantly what level of PostScript? What error message or problems occur? What driver version are you using? What OS version? What app and version?   \n   \nThe only RIP I have ever seen that simply could not handle OpenType also couldn't print TrueType. They were part of a specialized newspaper system that required AFM files and Type 1 fonts only. However, it's possible there is some component in the workflow that creates a problem with OpenType.   \n   \nDavid:   \n   \nAgain, more information would be helpful. What app are you printing from? Have you tried the OpenType version of Myriad, or just the MM version? What version of OS X?   \n   \nBrenda:   \n   \nGenerally speaking, OpenType fonts work just fine with QuarkXPress 4.11. What specific problem are you having? What OS are you on, what version of ATM are you running, what kind of printer, and what printer driver?   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT   \n   \nThomas Phinney   \nProgram Manager   \nFonts & Core Technologies   \nAdobe Systems\n\n"

Bummer.   \n   \nJust to elaborate on that, I've been told of a newspaper production system that requires that the Type 1 fonts and matching AFM files be actually loaded onto the RIP. Not much to be done about that one. But for anything less extreme, remember that once a PostScript flavored OpenType font is in a print stream, it literally is a Type 1 font. Same for it being in a PDF.   \n   \nWhat types of files does this newspaper printer accept, exactly? PDF?   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"
