  "content": "Hey everyone, I am sure that some of you will like this: I wrote an article about Neue Helvetica on my blog and then Erik Spiekermann joined in (as he was a design consultant for the face) and things got awesome. Today he emailed me some scans of the original marketing materials from the 80's. You can download and view them from the article's comments section. I hope you like it.\n\n[http://travisneilson.com/thought/old-vs-neue/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014143126/http:/travisneilson.com/thought/old-vs-neue/)\n\n",

In fact what I said was:\n\n\"Of course this study only concerns two weights from each family, and is therefore slightly limited in its scope.  \nI am not recommending that in all cases this is true for all applications, but for this study, the winner is Hel­vetica Neue with three out of four votes!\"\n\nI have not heard that the original Helvetica is better for print before. Why do you say so? Is that your opinion, or is there data to back that up?\n\n"

      "content": "The redesign of Helvetica Neue to make the characters a little more structurally unified fits better to the pixel grid (or at least seems to), making it easier to read on screen. The slight differences that the original Helvetica has between characters (well, the ones the Neue alters) make it easier to read on print (by making the characters more distinguishable).\n\nBut, I'll pull a quote from your article to get the true opinion flowing:  \n\"For the longest time I used Helvetica and Helvetica Neue interchangeably and really had no preference for either of them.\" One just does one job slightly better than the other, that's about it.\n\nRegarding your opinion on which is superior, I was referring to the section just above that block of text. It seemed to be implied that your preference was very slightly towards Neue.\n\n"
