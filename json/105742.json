  "content": "This is my first attempt at a sans-serif font with a bit more complexity than your typical strict geometric sans...  \nI wanted something that melded together Century Bold, Futura Medium, and your typical bold/medium grotesk, something like Helvetica Bold. I wanted the geometry to be something a bit \"dumbed\" down rather than strictly machined, but retain a sense of craftsmanship.\n\nAs I said this is my first attempt at something other than a geometric sans, and was drawn in illustrator(haven't quite been able to figure out fontlab's drawing system...) and want to try and iron out as much as possible before I begin to import the characters.\n\nPlease any suggestions at all are welcome.\n\nThanks,  \nDavid\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font text1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317200430/http:/typophile.com/files/font%20text1.pdf) | 364.01 KB |\n\n",
