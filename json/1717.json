I'm considering Leviathan Black Italic for the logotype and looking for some suggestions in regards to a face to pair with it. The personality should be friendly, fun, exciting, and somewhat informal yet professional.   \n   \nInitial thoughts are Base Twelve Sans or Optima.\n\n",

      "content": "So the list grows...   \n   \nDaniel - I like Tarzana, it has many of the attributes I suggested. I also briefly looked at Triplex, but the italic (which I'll need) is a little too funky.   \n   \nTiffany - Gotham is (of course) brilliant, but I feel it's too geometric for this gig. While it would pair nicely with Leviathan, it's personality is not quite right.   \n   \nI have the follwing in contention at present: Base 9 or 12 Sans, Optima, Tarzana, TheSans.   \n   \nI'm going to check out some of Nick's offerings at [ShinnType](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017074856/http:/www.shinntype.com/) as well as Rian H's ( [Device](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017074856/http:/devicefonts.co.uk/)). More face and foundry suggestions are _more_ than welcome.\n\n"

Not only have I been exposed to some fantastic new faces and foundries, but I'm reconsidering the Leviathan pairing all together.   \n   \nDaniel -- John Sans is BRILLIANT, as are the faces from Terminal. Their quality is immediately evident upon viewing.   \n   \nI also found a face called Lux Sans at Thirstype which has a nice feel. Feedback on this faces' quality would be appreciated.   \n   \nSo my shortlist is as follows (in no particular order), but funnily I'm still hanging on to Base 12 Sans (my first instinct) because of it's character and small caps as well ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017074856im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nBase 12, Emigre   \nJohn Sans, Storm   \nClearviewOne, Terminal   \nGiacamo, Terminal   \nTheSans\\*, Fontfabrik   \nLux Sans, Thirstype   \n   \nI've ruled out Tarzana and Fedra Sans due to certain idiosyncrasies.   \n   \n\\*Is there anywhere online where one can actually set/testdrive Fontfabrik typefaces with one's own text sample?
