The Font Bureau version in the link has two versions--one that's about the right weight but too condensed, and one the right width but not bold enough. There were a lot of film font versions of this, and I'm guessing it's one of them. The swashes were probably part of it, too, although they look like they are from a wider version.\n\n"
