  "content": "hi. Am new to this forum, so perhaps am posting my questions in the wrong place.   \n   \nI'm looking for highway road signs, specifically \"fallling rock\" graphics or \"falling ice\".

I found one at Mesa Verde, but its not what I'm looking for.   \n   \nI glimpsed a great one in a friends slide from New Zealand.\n\n",
