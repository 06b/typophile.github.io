  "content": "Hello all! I am new to this forum and maybe I guess it's a bit ugly to go straight on to announce a project I am working on. But I hope you might think this is interesting and therefore can forgive me :) It is an iOS app called Font Drafts, designed to boost the font sketching process and I am currently looking for beta testers. If anyone of you are interested, please sign up at the website: [http://fontdrafts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402035154/http:/fontdrafts.com/)\n\nThis seems like a great forum by the way, so I think I might hang around a bit more :)\n\n",
