(This one's serious.)   \n   \n3) Do the Germans have it right? (Or are they just heavily laden with Besessenheitmitvollkommengeometrischgestalt?)\n\n",

I have no memory of ever having a problem with the distinction. However, I learned to read quite late (around seven years old), and I suspect most of the books I competently read first used the double-storey versions. By the way, there's something to be said for learning to read after one has developed a reasonable vocabulary: one gets to start with much more interesting books.   \n   \n2. Yes. I think there are very few non-italic typefaces in which the single-storey a looks good, while the either version of the g can be used much more liberally. Frutiger is a good example of a typeface that very successfully matches the double-storey a with the single-storey g, but there are very many others.\n\n"

It (the bi-level 'a' and 'g') just seemed like another weird no-reason rule of Life that I needed to know and not question. I was a very passive kid. However, it did seem to make a little sense, since I remember thinking the same thing about serifs.\n\n"
