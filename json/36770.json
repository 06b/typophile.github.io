What sort of image does the company want to convey?\n\nThese are all questions that you should ask when designing the label. We can help you find something that won't clash with Copperplate, but the field is far too broad. These more important questions come first.\n\n"

The competition is Bella Sera , cavit\n\nClassic and contemporary not trendy or humorous.\n\nThis is italian wine many varietals each one will have different color accents to stand apart from the others. I want to maintain copperplate as the product brand font.\n\nThanks for your help\n\n"
