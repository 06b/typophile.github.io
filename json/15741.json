Or indeed another face that is as clean with both character sets?\n\nI need a set and nothing available that I can see in my searches through most supplliers and foundries. Most \"grunge\" fonts are pretty bad and not a patch on this one. This face looks like it was taken from an old letterpress or woodtype and has all the characteristics of one and is \"clean\" in its ink spread, etc. Only thing is, it has no lower case characters.\n\nAny suggestions or help would be appreciated.\n\ncheers\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [dirty\\_headline0.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100803045943/http:/typophile.com/files/dirty_headline0.png) | 3.68 KB |\n\n",
