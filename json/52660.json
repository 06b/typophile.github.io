  "content": "Hey everyone.\n\nWell, I just finished my first term at Art Center on Friday. Man, it was pretty grueling, they work the crap out of you.\n\nI took Type 1 from Leah Hoffmitz who is an excellent type and logo designer. She does a lot of freelance work for Landor in San Francisco, and she drew both the FedEx and Banana Republic logo.\n\nAnyway, we spent a good 4 or 5 weeks working on 2 logotypes; 1 corporate, 1 retail (or just smaller company). Just to let you know, these were not originally done on the computer by manipulating a typeface, they were both sketched and painted on tabloid paper in Plaka before more revisions, and then digitization. My corporate logo is for Nikon (camera company), the second is for a hat and clothing company called Brixton.\n\nI've had about 4 weeks of feedback from my teacher, so I was just curious to hear what some of you guys had to say about the logotypes. Thanks!\n\nJosh\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Nikon.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419042739/http:/typophile.com/files/Nikon.jpg) | 369.31 KB |\n| [Brixton.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419042739/http:/typophile.com/files/Brixton.jpg) | 378.4 KB |\n\n",

Funny though how she was mentioned at the beginning of that link as being \"typography professor leah hoffmitz\".\n\nI like what you did with the t, but I am unsure about whether or not I like the x the original or flipped way. Maybe i have just been looking at it too much lately.\n\nOverall though, I feel like I did an okay job for my first term type 1 class. It was really awesome drawing and painting type from scratch. We also painted 3 \"Hamburge\"s in different styles, which really helped how I look at type.\n\n"

However, because I had asked Leah to work with Futura<br>\nBold, I was still not satisfied with the distinctively smaller Futura<br>\nx-height, the very tall ascender of the lower-case \"d\" or the relatively<br>\neven Futura strokes. It was then that I decided to explore the possibility<br>\nof marrying Futura Bold with Univers 65. The result is what you see today.<br>\nLeah is indeed to be credited with an important contribution to the success<br>\nof the FedEx identity program.</cite>\n\n"

If you try it with very well kerned type, you will see that it's not really true. It does need to be visually even in color, but nobody has a complete formula, though some out there are pretty good.\n\nWhen you have difficulty spacing something, I think it is often a problem with the letters themselves. I suspect your o or k may be too wide compared to the n, and that is giving you problems.\n\nFor me the black letter with the wood-cut look characters don't work together.\n\n"

Also upside down reading helps, because you're not disturbed by the meaning of letters but rather look at shapes.\n\nAs you pointed out yourself: it's not geometry and calculation. It's visual balance. And Beejay's version is balanced. Pixel too wide or not, it's better.\n\nI'm not commenting on Brixton because my mind today is not at its best for such sophisticated lettering.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
