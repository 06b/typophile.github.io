The New York calligrapher Paul Standard served as Grady's contact with Gill, after Grady had seen a similar Gill alphabet stone in an exhibition, English present-day calligraphy and illumination, organized by Standard and on view in New York in February 1938. The London firm Sculpture and Memorials acted as Gill's agent for the commission. Accompanying the stone is a note from Gill stating: \"I cut this A.B.C. on July 1st & 2nd 1938 on HoptonWood Stone for Mr. Grady. The colouring was done by Michael Richey.\" The stone is signed and dated in the lower right corner, with Gill's monogram [EG 1938]; it arrived in New York in January 1939.\n\nThe original shipping and customs documents were acquired with the stone. Grady's correspondence with Paul Standard, George T. Friend, Eric Gill, and the London firm Sculpture and Memorials regarding the commission was donated later by John C. Grady.  \n---end quote--  \nDon\n\n"
