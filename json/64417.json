  "content": "Hello all,  \n I'm looking for any information folks might have about Les Usherwood, his career and his legacy. I'm currently a student at Humber College in their Graphic Design program and we've been asked to profile select Canadian designers, illustrators and art directors for what I'm told will go into the ADCC archives. If there's anyone on here who worked with Les, I'd be really interested in asking a few questions.  \nThank you,  \njr\n\n",
