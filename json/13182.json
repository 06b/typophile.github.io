It does not translate well in black/white, looks like a flying insect when it’s very small, and just seems overall weak to me. (Odd thing - people have offered positive comments when they see my business card.)\n\nAlthough I’ve developed some pretty good logos for clients, I’m struggling with my own design. Too close to it perhaps? I recognize that I’m a far better web designer than I am a graphic artist!\n\nI’d like to depict the biplane (thus the ‘Barnstormer’) without appearing cartoon-like. I’m also working with a sky/clouds theme for my website. I’m not locked into the red/black necessarily.\n\nHere’s a link to my current logo and business card:  \n{link removed}\n\nI look forward to your expert advice and critique!\n\ndeborah\n\n",

I like the Barnstormer idea in general, but I’m not sure what the ‘zen biplane’ isn’t giving you that you’d like to get from the new logo. Personally, I’d push for an engraved or silkscreened feel for the graphics, not knowing any specifics. Also, the biplane coming at someone head-on is a very strong implied statement, but may not read as well as a 3/4 view (something like [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20051218050521/http:/www.ohtm.org/stearman.html)). Have you considered creating a small vignetted image (something like [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20051218050521/http:/www.realflight.com/gallery/ultimate-2.jpg), but framed in an oval), since a barnstormer flies daringly close to the earth?\n\nAlso, as an aside, [This image of Kitty Hawk](http://web.archive.org/web/20051218050521/http:/www.publispain.com/super-posters/LimitedEditions-WilburWrightBiplaneatKittyHawk.htm) is just really great.\n\n"

I’ve struggled to find something appropriate and am open to suggestions from forum members.\n\nThe contact info at 100% is 9pt Times. (The web sample is shown slightly reduced.) Perhaps 10pt would be better?\n\nAnother approach I considered was to remove the plane and use a modified type logo for the name against a full color blue sky/wht cloud photo background. For blk/wht reproduction, I’d supply just the name, but on my web and business card, include the clouds.\n\nThe business name works well for me. In my marketing materials and when meeting with a prospect for the first time, I explain the connection between barnstorming and my design philosophy. My prospects and clients seem to like the story behind this connection and easily remember the “barnstormer” portion of the name.\n\nI feel like I’m back to square one…. but sometimes it’s easier to start over than to fix the unfixable. Thanks again.\n\n"

If you decide to make the ‘painted’ plane the main focus, I think you should choose a less ornamented, more neutral sans serif typeface. Visually the painted plane is quite dominant, and with this ornamental serifed face the name competes with the image.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you think the name of the company is the main focus, I’d play down on the symbol. Use a less intense color combination, or just use a subtler style.\n\nIn general I think the business cards desperately need some air. Try not to fill every space, in stead play around with a subtle composition using lots of whitespace. If you use a plane as an image, i think it is better to give it some room to fly. :-)\n\n——————————————————————————  \nMy work is a game. A very serious game [M.C. Escher]\n\n"

The thing about the old biplanes - or monoplanes was that they had an ink on paper letters & aviator’s silk scarf side - soft & expressive, as well as a block letter & grease side - tough & pragmatic, all held together with purpose & wire.\n\nIf you were the son or daughter of one of these pilots, you might have something from him that would evoke the whole experience for you - even if it was a pen ( not a great example but let that go). And that suggestion or abstract element might be more reasonant than the literal aircraft.\n\nI wonder if a card could be made in the shape of a propeller - maybe it folds. Then you could have info on one side & have a propeller image on the other. Maybe not too. But thats the kind of more abstract kind of thing I was thinking of.\n\n"

Looking at your new/old image above, I’d still choose the original over the new one.\n\nThe answer might just be sharpening and simplifying the old brush stroked logo to give it a more modern, clean look. Maybe just [GIS “propeller”](http://web.archive.org/web/20051218050521/http:/images.google.com/images?q=propeller&btnG=Search&svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en), pick one, and draw over it in Illustrator and add some [plane wings](http://web.archive.org/plane%20wings)?
