We strived for simple, but ended up with bland.  \n2) Unrelatable to our primary audience (college students)  \n3) We strove for: Sleek, high quality, class, professional, fun\n\nThe New  \nWe’re looking for a new identity for our upcoming expansion  \n1) Color scheme. Finding a color scheme that fits us is our primary mission. The colors have to work across the platform  \n2) More fun while keeping the quality. Our userbase consists primarily of college students looking for a pizza deal and an upcoming concert. We’re looking for a way to keep the sleek and simple image but add a splash of personality  \n3) Minimal changes to the current logo. We still want our image to be continuous and recognizable after the change  \n4) Adjectives: Sleek, simple, fun, reliable, likable, lighthearted, going out\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317195814im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Desktop%20HD_6482.png)\n\n",
