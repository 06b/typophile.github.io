Some type-designers are very nice and fix the eth after I point it out and send jpg samples for comments. Other have given me lectures about how people like Gunnlaugur Briem don't know how to design fonts and refuse to accept that their eth is wrong. Seriously, I've gotten emails from two of the \"top\" type-designer that try and dispute me.\n\neth is a tough one due to the fact that it's only used in Iceland and Faroe Islands (as I know of)  \nI don't blame people for designing it wrong but I try and point it out when i can and hopefully designers will remember some guy sending them an email nagging about some eths or maybe see something about this on Typophile ;)  \nWas going to send David Berlow/Font Bureau a note on this.\n\nSigurður Ármannsson has some notes on making eths as well: [http://font.is/?p=7](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019005954/http:/font.is/?p=7 \"http://font.is/?p=7\")\n\n---  \nOscar Bjarna  \n [http://analog.sys.is](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019005954/http:/analog.sys.is/ \"http://analog.sys.is\")\n\n"

I felt not, and I think this design, radical as it may seem, is better than the look of a straight bar.\n\nNevertheless, being but a humble English-speaking tool-maker I'm not in the business of denying whatever erect and proper traditions whatever people require of whatever letters I make and I had no intention of crossing Briem or anyone else on Icelandic issues. If any Faroese, Icelanders, Anglo-Saxons, medieval Scandinavians, iconophiles or customers of any kind need this to be straightened out, by all means, when ordering FBTG add a note to \"please Briem-o-matic l.c. eth\". Same as if already purchased, we guarantee our eth as if our very eths were at stake.\n\n\"FF Clan, though it’s more modern.\"  \nOne of the other things I asked myself long before I got the eth, is \"Isn't it time for some nice display sans that _do not_ have gigantic lowercases?\"\n\nCheers!\n\n"
