  "content": "Here is the Design Alchemy logo , which is a modified \"A\" from RXC' s Spanner typeface. It weighs in at about 230 lbs and is fabricated to spec by Rubicon Design + Fabrication in solid 4\" steel using plasma cutting technique. It was then distressed with torch and hammer.   \nI had it photographed by Robin Bartholick (bartholick.com) . We shot 5 rolls of 4x5 and then scanned the best pictures at 360 meg files with a Nikon 8000 film scanner. We did a couple of rolls experimenting with fire by applying rubber cement and ligthing it on fire.   \nI have yet to finish up these as they take lots of time due to difficulty of creating realistic masks around fire.   \nI am currently going through ideas and comps for a co-promotion of Psyops/Design Alchemy. I will post this as it comes into final stages.   \n ![Metal A .jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317205238im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/798.jpg)\n\n",

I think that the B-boys, and grafitti have to study more architecture.   \nIn my personal wave, i´m study the 3-d grafitty   \nstyle and i imagine this as a new kind of urban expression, with more impact!   \nCongratulations, guys!!!!   \n   \nMiguel.\n\n"
