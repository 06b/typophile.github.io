      "content": "Hi Graham.   \n   \nI assume some of the unorthodoxy you are metioning is the absence of certain ball terminals. Some unorthodoxy is good. I think you've got some other issues though, mainly stroke modulation and color issues.   \n   \nCaps:   \nSeems like all of the thicks in your round letters could be thicker (they are all light) In the first line, check the CO vs the INRP etc.   \n   \nYour bracketed serifs are making dark spots. Thin them out a bit. Check the Z vs the Y   \n   \nG needs weight on the right side.   \n   \nLowerCase:   \nAgain, rounds need more weight. Check out how dark the stem of the p is vs the round. Check all the rounds pqdbaeg etc.   \n   \nt: The weight gets too light too early as you move into the tail.   \n   \ng: Needs weight in the tail.   \n   \nOverall. It's ok if you don't want the ball terminals, but it leaves you with a problem. The ends of your letters are really weak. For example the sS should be as dark as the other letters. They aren't though. I suppose you could really thicken up the spine and leave off the terminals, but that's why they were put there in the first place. I guess what I'm getting at is: You must solve that problem. Maybe in an unorthodox way\n\n"

      "content": "This is looking much more polished, although it's been \"tamed\" as well. It's like a calm, neutral serif face - uncommon. It feels like something in the spirit of Bookman, with an affinity for journalism.   \n   \nThe glyphs that stand out:   \n- \"J\": needs a full curl.   \n- \"g\": needs to be more rigid.   \n- \"&\": very cool, but out of character.   \n- \"7\": very nice.   \n   \nAlso, you need to decide if this is a text face or a display face. For the former I'd make it a bit darker and lengthen the ascenders; for the latter it's fine as it is.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "The \"J\" is better, but I'd make it narrower, and it does need some kind of terminal. A ball terminal (like in Primer) is one option, and for that I'd look at your \"f\" - although that's more of a \"teardrop\" terminal\\*. You could also try a serif (like in your \"S\") for a terminal.   \n   \n\\* Now I'm thinking maybe your \"f\" needs a ball terminal instead.   \n   \nThe ampersand in your main character set is OK to me.   \n   \nThe new \"g\" is almost there: it just needs to move the stroke weight in its tail to either the bottom or -more unconventionally- to the right. (And I'd avoid the common practice of putting weight in the horizontal part of the join.)   \n   \nThe eszet seems too dynamic - try making that curvy part less curvy.   \nAnd to me a texty eszet benefits from an abrupt shift where the top curve starts going in.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I think some of the   \ncoolest stuff comes from people who are trying to figure   \nout what letters are 'supposed' to look like. Once they figure   \nit out, it looks like everything else. I think that's what   \nhappened here. I think the super short serifs and miniature   \nball terminals are great. However, I agree that the terminals   \non C and the S from the first version need something.\n\n"

I do agree with your view that this constant change to suit others opinions ends up (sometimes) changing a font too much. The idea that someone has can end up being blanded out of existance. Yes it is nice to have a good looking font, but you do need to retain the originality.
