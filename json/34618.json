Can anyone help me find a beautiful classic serif preferably a new design with a special take on ancient italian styles (not french didot look = too soft and female). Keywords are classical but modern, solid and professional not quirky and charming. I just need to hear what you think are good serifs then I can look them up to see if I find something interesting then maybe I can provide you all with a more specific topic question:-)\n\n [‹ Typophile back online](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907152410/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34879 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Re-naming updated typefaces ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907152410/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34785 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
