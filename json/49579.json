I suppose Arial is to Helvetica in what i understand you're sort of wanting, but Bello is pretty unique and finding some random typeface online is unlikely.\n\n**Edited**\n\nAre you creating a illustration comp using Photoshop? Feel is one thing, but the user could use any typeface to at least try the techniques out.\n\n"
