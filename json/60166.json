I can't figure out why, because all of the letters have exactly the same height in Fontlab (see \"H\" and \"E\" above). It's an opentype PS font. Does anyone know how to correct this?\n\n",

This is not my first font and I can't remember having this problem before.  \nIt's as if fontlab adds a negative overshoot to these letters.\n\n"

I used an extra negative horizontal hint on top of the horizontal hint that was already their. This levels the height to that of the other letters.  \nMaybe not the best method, but it works. If anyone has an better method that will fix this problem (preferable only with the use of Fontlab) I'd like to know, thanks :)\n\n"
