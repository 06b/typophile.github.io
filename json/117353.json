We sometimes lump them together as \"Baseball\" scripts. See for example Fenway Park JF [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jawfonts/fenway-park-jf/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725043136/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jawfonts/fenway-park-jf/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jawfonts/fenway-park-jf/\") Philly Sport Script is close [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/philly-sport-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725043136/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/philly-sport-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/philly-sport-script/\") except for the J.  \nAnother possible alternative is Arizona [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/arizonia/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725043136/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/arizonia/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/arizonia/\")  \nFor this type of business a script based on an old Miller beer logo, like Font Mesa's Draft Beer [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/draft-beer-classic/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725043136/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/draft-beer-classic/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/draft-beer-classic/\") might be adaptable.  \nAs for \"Barbador\" I am not certain as to which font this is.  \nDon\n\n"
