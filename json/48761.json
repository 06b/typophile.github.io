  "content": "Alright, InDy is my b\\*\\*\\*h, but I can’t crack this one: the resize icons and other features are missing from the bottom of the Glyph palette. It disappeared about a week ago, and I can’t get it back. I’ve tried opening from the “Type” menu, from the “Window” menu; had it in the palette dock, ripped it out. Checked out the fly-out menu on the glyph palette. Nothting. App and OS restarts aplenty, too.\n\nI never considered it to be too important, but I really miss this feature! Any ideas?\n\nID CS3 on Mac OS X.4.11 (Intel).\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122121640/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_97.png) | 90.08 KB |\n\n [‹ Someone please help with Font Management!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122121640/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48800 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typography magazine ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122121640/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44779 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
