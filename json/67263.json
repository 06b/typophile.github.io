Is there a licensing issue I'm not understanding? As a friend to type designers and lover of type I would hate to make an incorrect move here.  \nPlease share any insight you have into this matter. It would be greatly appreciated.\n\n"

So then you you’ll have to go purchase licenses yourself and what’s the point of that, if the fonts are on their way?\n\nHow long is this “weird” situation going to take? Are we talking weeks?!\n\nMight be more effective to list the options you have available to you currently and let the Typophiles kibitz on which will be the most suitable stand-ins.\n\nShould be entertaining.\n\n"
