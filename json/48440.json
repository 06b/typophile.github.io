I am using Bernhard Gothic SG Heavy at 24pt.\n\nI am not having this problem with any other weight. Of course, I know how to fix this manually, but does anyone else have this problem?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122074618im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Picture1_6407.jpg)\n\n [‹ Font Conference (funny video)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122074618/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47655 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font copyright question. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122074618/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48322 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Unfortunately, I only have CS2 at work, but I have CS3 at home.\n\nFlorian, that WHOLE line looks better in the URW version. It’s hard to see with what I posted, but the glyphs also appear to jump up and down along the baseline. Only the heavy though. Now that I’m comparing them, they look much different. Esp the x-height.\n\nIf I have the same problems at home, I’ll definitely write an email to SG.\n\n"

Since this is the font the client wants, I think I am going to see if we can purchase the URW version.\n\nTop is optical, below is metrics. Still not great, although an improvement in CS3.\n\n"
