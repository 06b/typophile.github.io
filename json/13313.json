Assuming Farsi and Arabic are the same, I would make them darker, more curvy, and slightly taller.\n\nBut there are other problems. I don't know Farsi, but I can see that:  \n1) The spacing (especially between words) is shaky.  \n2) The Kaaf in the last word (far left) most probably needs to join with the Noon, instead of being the lone form (unless it's some quite peculiar Farsi exception).\n\nhhp\n\n"
