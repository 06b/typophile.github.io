  "content": "I did a booklet using Perpetua, client loved it. They are now doing a similar booklet, different event. They want a similar look but want to use a different font. They liked the clean, classic yet edgy look. I hoping to find a font with similar characteristics. There is a lot of text and several tables so the slightly compressed character width was very helpful as well. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n",
