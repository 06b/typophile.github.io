If there's interest, I'll release it.   \nComments pro or con are welcome.   \n   \n ![Ascii](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416080437im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/213.gif)\n\n",

You could even make an interactive game out of it or something.   \n   \nExtrapolate into the dimension of time, and you might just end up with something wildly interesting. And it would be \\*really\\* experimental! :-)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
