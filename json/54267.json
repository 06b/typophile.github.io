  "content": "Swiss Style takes design back to simplicity, the notable principles of this style are based upon geometry, grid systems and pure objectivity. The design of this time moves away from hand drawn illustration and relies heavily on the use of industrial photography. The style is recognizable by use of sans serif, flush left, ragged right type set in narrow columns, giving it a look of precision and uniformity. My favorite designer of the period is Josef Muller-Brockmann. In this particular image his use of scale and camera angle are visually interesting and delineate movement.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101119091103im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mullerbrockmann_3512.jpg)\n\nVictorian Era design has very ornate design, symmetrical layouts and overall is very romantic and nostalgic. The image has thin decorative borders enhancing the text. I like that it is hand illustrated and very realistic. I love the typography of this time, it has a lot of ornamentation and is drawn to curve around the images and various hand drawn typefaces are incorporated into one poster. The posters designed during this time covered he entire page leaving little, if any negative space.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101119091103im_/http:/typophile.com/files/beecham_4994.jpg)\n\nPop Art is a period of art that combines art with commercial and a reflection of that particular time. Everyday we are bombarded with advertisements and slogans and its not often that I stop and think of how much power they have and how absurd they sometimes are. One of my favorite pop artists is James Rosenquist, who was a billboard painter and who now makes billboard scale paintings. The painting below, F-111, was made during the Vietnam war and is made up of 23 sections, 10 x 86'. It depicts the war, economy and daily stream of images an American would see or a part of what someone could be experiencing during 1964.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101119091103im_/http:/typophile.com/files/f111_opt_3650.jpg)\n\n",
