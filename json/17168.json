One of the benefits is that you have the option of picking up Eidetic Neo and [Eidetic Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827235736/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_eidetm.html) (the corresponding sans) in a bundle for 15% off the standalone price.\n\nPSY/OPS also offers other cool stuff like a free weight for every $100 spent, a 15% student discount, and the option to try out a single weight and then deduct its cost from that of the whole family if you decide to purchase a family license within 30 days.\n\n"

I already picked up two weights of [Armchair Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827235736/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneo.html) with my home licenses of [Sophisto](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827235736/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_sophisto_ss.html) and [Oxtail](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827235736/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html), and the corporate-wide licenses for Sophisto and [Eidetic Neo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827235736/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneo.html) made [my employer](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827235736/http:/www.magelaan.be/) pick up the other weights of Armchair Modern and the frankly surprising and very exciting [Hydrous](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827235736/http:/www.psyops.com/html/spec_hydrous.html).\n\nThe complimentary free licenses allow you to try out stuff you maybe wouldn’t think of. Plus — I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again — [Psy/Ops](http://web.archive.org/web/20080827235736/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/psy_ops) has one of the most consistent and forward-thinking compact collections on the market. Classy on the outside, quirky on the inside. Melts in yo’ brain, not in your eyes. You can’t go wrong, really.\n\n"
