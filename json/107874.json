  "content": "A 3 day long weekend crash course in type design is coming to SF, CA - Crafting Type Jan 10-12. It will be held at FontShop in the North Beach area. The class is geared to total beginners but people who have had a bit of experience and want to work on specific aspects of their design process are encouraged to come as well.\n\nThe idea behind the course is to either  \n- give you a running start in type design so you have resources and insights needed to keep going or  \n- give a typographer or any user of type insights into using type that can only come from making some\n\nIt is hard work because it is all day (9-6) for 3 days but it is also hugely fun. Students are routinely amazed at how far they have come in 3 days.\n\nFor more background have a look at here [http://craftingtype.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418202220/http:/craftingtype.com/ \"http://craftingtype.com/\")  \nTo sign up : [https://www.tug.org/craftingtype/register-2014-01-sf.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418202220/https:/www.tug.org/craftingtype/register-2014-01-sf.html \"https://www.tug.org/craftingtype/register-2014-01-sf.html\")\n\nIf anyone has questions please ask!\n\nWe are very grateful to FontShop for hosting us!\n\nThanks!\n\n",
