I want feeds that have random but interesting words or phrases as the title of each entry.\n\nThis one works pretty well for my purposes (and it’s funny too).  \n [feed://www.overheardinnewyork.com/index.xml](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203154642/http:/www.overheardinnewyork.com/index.xml)\n\nI don’t want things that sound like news headlines or have the name of the feed in all of the titles.\n\nMaybe a feed of famous one-liners? Or a good “word of the day” feed? (all the ones I’ve found so far have the name of the dictionary or some other additional text placed in the title)\n\nIt’d be an added bonus if the feed uses proper punctuation… smart quotes, etc\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n [‹ Site using both serif and sans fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203154642/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38398 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Si caught with his pants down while Redsox wait for Rocky Mountain high! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203154642/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38372 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
