I cannot even begin to describe how much one learns from sitting around in a room full of type junkies listening to type designers talking about designing type.\n\nEdit: Someone just handed me a poster from Basel, they’re doing a type design workshop from July 7-11.

Baselschoolofdesign.ch\n\nI’ve always been intrigued by Basel, but really, you are going to need a few semesters or a few years to learn how to do type, not a few days.\n\nTravel to TypeCon is expensive from Europe, even given the weak dollar. Europe has a lot of great conferences, too, like TYPO Berlin and most of the annual ATypI conferences. But actually, given a lot of the travel and accommodation costs, TypeCon may not end up being more expensive…\n\nRegarding language, both the University of Reading (UK) and the Dutch Royal Academy of the Arts in the Hague teach their Masters courses in English.\n\n"
