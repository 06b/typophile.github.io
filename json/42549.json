Or [Sumner Stone](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017055311/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Sumner%20Stone)’s [ITC Bodoni](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017055311/http:/www.stonetypefoundry.com/itcbodoni.html) and [Cycles](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017055311/http:/www.stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html).

Or …\n\nFor Caslon: [ITC Founder’s Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017055311/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/founders-caslon/) has optical sizes. You can also simply combine matching fonts and, for example, utilize [Big Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017055311/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/carter_cone/big_caslon/) by Carter & Cone for large sizes.\n\nF\n\n"
