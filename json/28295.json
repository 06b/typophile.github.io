I've been hunting all over for a good photograph or rubbing or book specimen or anything. No luck. I bet I could find something, maybe, at the Library, but they don't like me because I keep books for too long ;(\n\nDoes anyone know of a good book with specimens to look for? Or does anyone have available a high res image or images?\n\nI appreciate it advance by the way. Anything you can do will help.\n\n",

Almost all of the lettering books for commercial artists and signwriters from the first half of the 20thC contained at least one version of the authors' take on the Trajan lettering. My own favourite would be p.29 of 'The Art of Lettering' by Geoffrey Mott, but this material is very commonplace and for less than $20, cheap.\n\n"

Clearly, users should not be allowed to use historically-based fonts for anachronistic text. For example, when using Imperivm (or similar Trajan based fonts) copy such as TRIVMPHAL ARCH should be allowed, but the open-type font software should screen for and block text such as IVICY FRVIT GVM._\\</irony\\>_\n\n_\\<deeper irony\\>_On second thought, for true historical accuracy, the Imperivm font should only allow text in Latin. Any other language would clearly be anachronistic._\\</deeper irony\\>_\n\n_\\<serious comment\\>_The advocates of historically-accurate font use, need to keep in mind that the users of Imperivm (and similar fonts) are NOT in ancient Rome craving the glyphs in stone -- they are using them on paper and electronic devices worldwide in the 21st century, so there is already a built-in anachronism in the use of these fonts. Users should be permitted to use the fonts however they please (whether we like the results or not). All fonts ought to be available with the widest possible set of glyphs (including the dreaded @)._\\</serious comment\\>_\n\n_\\<postscript\\>_Dan, what’s the status of Imperivm? Any samples you could post? _\\</postscript\\>_  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_When going from_ A to Z,  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I often end up_ At Oz.\n\n"

It's clear that freedom is largely perceived in an absolute value, but we do not live on an absolute plane, since we have to deal with the sensibility of our fellow men.  \nSo, you will agree that I may propose an intended usage out of assumed expectations, even if this exludes an \"@\" sign, if this is my cultural intention.\n\n"

And this really has nothing to do with any pedantic historical accuracy (I certainly can't be accused of that! :-) it has to do with perception, and its judicious leveraging.\n\nAdults help children do the right thing (because of their experience and knowledge), and everybody is childlike in some contexts. Users need our help (because of our experience and knowledge) whether they realize/admit it or not. This is why Adobe InDesign does not allow fake bold for example.\n\nOn top of that, there's actually self-interest involved too. Just because you can sell more copies of a font for the first year because it's more \"versatile\" doesn't make it smart to sacrifice its long-term viability, which can only come from its _focus_. Why do you think Trajan has become a parody of itself, and most intelligent graphic designers avoid it?\n\nChris: we are all responsible for the _results_.\n\nhhp\n\n"
