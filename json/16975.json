  "content": "Hello typophilers  \nI work on a corporate identity and have to make the guide.  \nSince it has to be in english and this is not my mother tongue,  \nI need to have some samples. I did a little research,  \nbut I am not satisfied. Also I realized that there is no  \nstandard in terminology. For example I found those 3 descriptions:  \nlogo=symbol+signature, Mark=symbol+namestyle and mark=symbol+logotype.  \nSo if anyone has some good examples please do let me know.\n\nI send you the logo (?) which will be in both french and English (!!!)  \nso you can suggest the proper description.\n\nchristos\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522220111/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_9.jpg) | 86.02 KB |\n\n",

Below the logo is the signature.\n\nAIGA has a PDF of their identity guidelines here: [http://www.aiga.org/resources/content/1/0/5/1/documents/ID\\_Guidelines.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522220111/http:/www.aiga.org/resources/content/1/0/5/1/documents/ID_Guidelines.pdf)\n\nLook at page 6 where it explains how to use the various signatures.\n\nGreat logo by the way. I love bi- and multilingual identities.\n\n"
