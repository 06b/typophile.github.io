  "content": "Need help with this classic poster font, very common throughout the 70s! It’s sometimes mis-identified as Univers Condensed, but the lower case “g” is totally different, as is the upper case “S”. It's also commonly mistaken for SF Movie Poster. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209213444im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1941%20font_5070.jpg)\n\n",
