Have you tried it with breaking the branches of the hmnr from their stems, for a more 'stencil' look? Or tried just forgetting about a consistent stencil look and having a closed oOQ? Maybe you could have alternative versions in the final. The design effect of the openning of the other letters than oOQ is so nice that this would be viable as a display face, without being a full stencil.   \n   \nGood luck with this; it has a nice, distinctive look.\n\n"

However, I think you might be overdoing the swash thing a little. For example, the pe's and ghe's might do better with a straight crossbar. Also, even though it is italic the lc de could stick with the uc design--I think it goes better with the spirit of the font. For the same reason I liked the old a and f better, and the o with the break at the top left strikes me as being the best one. So there's my opinion.\n\n"

As I stated earlier somewhere else in this forum, the Russian alphabet is not the original Cyrrilic alphabet. Russian character style dates back to the time of Peter The Great, who hired some French typographers to make first lead clichez, so he can publish books in Russian.  \nA small group of Bulgarian typographers now tries to impose the Bulgarian character design as a European standard for Cyrrilic, since Bulgaria will be (hopefully) the first country in EU to use Cyrrilic. This is a tough deal, and it's not supported by our govt. I doubt that they will succeed in this, because Bulgarian are mere 8 millions compared to whatever millions are Russians. But I think our style & design is better thatn Russian.\n\nAnd you may want to excuse me for my English. :)\n\n"

Of course, many Russians won't agree with me, as they are already comfortable with current style, widely supported by Apple, Microsoft & Adobe. It's a matter of perception - but I definitely think that Bulgarian style is more....beautiful than Russian. As you can see for yourself, the lower Cyrrilic \"v\" (or \"b\") in Russian style is nothing but a scaled down version of the capital letter.\n\nAs I stated in some earlier posts, the only company that develops true Bulgarian Cyrrilic fonts is HermesSOFT. Take a look at their examples and you will understand what I mean.\n\n[www.hermessoft.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417034703/http:/www.hermessoft.com/ \"www.hermessoft.com\")\n\nPS\\> Offtopic: Call me stupid, but I can't manage to post inline images instead of links to images - how do u guys do this?\n\n"

On the other hand, the Bulgarian style is severely Latinized, and this is severely bad. And it doesn't make sense that Bulgarian is more Authentic Cyrillic than the Russian style, because it is **farther** from it. In fact, I think Peter The Great Diluter would have been envious of the Bulgarian style...\n\nhhp\n\n"

These days Russia is no longer the big scary neighbor Bulgaria needs to worry about. The threat now comes from the west, so it might actually be a good time to reform their script.\n\nhhp\n\n"
