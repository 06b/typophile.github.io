I suspect the same goes for some of the [other fonts you are using](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017144555/http:/www.fontasticcalligraphy.com/?q=image/tid/2). E.g., [Carlotta](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017144555/http:/www.fontasticcalligraphy.com/?q=node/40) is [Carpenter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017144555/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/carpenter/familytree.html).\n\nMade a perfect first impression.\n\n"

Have not posted your weblink as I see you are advertising usage of typefaces there and now you have sort of alerted a few profile designers and they maybe interested.\n\nIt's nice to obtain good fonts, though it is much more rewarding to own a licence to use them and through the correct channels.\n\nHeck I would love to have a t-shirt from Sudtipos on the from \"Iegalcopy\" maybe in 'whomp' or another great (unfortunately not Veer as they do NO ship outside the US... doh) :) ...:):):) ..... (Mr Alejandro Paul, we can talk... I have ideas)\n\nJoin the club and don't let clients put you in a situation of asking for fonts for free. Hammer-time.\n\n"
