Big letters, small letters, the odd number and diacritic, a few, handpicked punctuation marks, you get the picture. Alas, I haven’t found any yet. Any ideas where I might find such a thing?\n\n [‹ Movie Poster Letters (Identification Game)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013104045/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48273 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lead type as luggage? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013104045/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48274 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It really is difficult to find, especially because you basically can’t google for it, because of desktop wallpaper usurping the name.\n\nIf all else fails I suppose I can always either print my own or break out the scanner, project & trace type onto standard wallpaper. Another idea might be something from Stefan Sagmeister’s book: Mask off areas of sheets of wallpaper with type, then leave in the sun to fade, finally peel off the mask. Oh well, the search goes on, I appreciate the help.\n\n"
