I am posting an image of the menu bar to see if anyone can help me identify it.\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121233909im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/font_5222.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Sans in Timothy Leary quote on Superfamous.com - Antenna {Mike Y}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121233909/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48968 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [UPSCENE! logo font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121233909/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48982 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

And no wonder you need the font, the word “SHEDULE” is misspelled!\n\nIf you want something with a similar flavor but actually good, take a look at [Mostra](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121233909/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/).\n\n"
