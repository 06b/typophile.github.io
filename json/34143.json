      "content": "At a conceptual level, I don’t think that the pine tree arrows work with the name. When I see pines I think of, well, more friendly mountains. Everest is about as imposing as geological features get, and the uplifting pine trees clash with that. The letterspaced type at the bottom appears to be competing for attention with its superior; toning it down and letting it settle into a nice quiet state would work better.\n\nAt a nitpicky level, chopping off the terminals of **s** creates a letter that draws attention away from all of the others. It also makes the letter look unbalanced when one is looking at the left side of the logo while the right remains in periphery. It also creates a weird gap because the horizontal stroke of **t** does not extend to the left.\n\nThe notch in **v** appears to flare a tiny bit due to the wide counter and narrowing strokes, try tucking it in a little.\n\nI’m not buying **r** at all, it’s too tall, and may be too narrow.\n\nMake the **e** s taller.\n\n"
