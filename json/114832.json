I attach new samples for you all.\n\nThanks in advance for your comments.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [aureal-0.22.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418093254/http:/typophile.com/files/aureal-0.22.pdf) | 222.84 KB |\n| [aureal-0.22-c.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418093254/http:/typophile.com/files/aureal-0.22-c.png) | 195.62 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I agree. /R looks correct, but the bowl of /P should be larger. The bowls of /P and /R don't necessarily need to match, and in my opinion they should never be the exact same bowl because in case of /P you need to compensate for the large space underneath the bowl.\n\nI also think the vertical serifs (E, F, L, T, Z, z) are too big and robust. It's not bad, but then I would make the other serifs and terminals more robust as well. You probably need a bit more consistency in your design.\n\n"
