  "content": "Hi Typophiles,\n\n[Typedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20130428134034/http:/typedia.com/) could use your help. As more typefaces, designers, and foundries are cataloged, its missing pieces of reference information grow increasingly obscure and difficult to hunt down—for the average visitor. You, on the other hand, have particular expertise in knowing, for instance, the Release Year or Country of Origin of a particular typeface.\n\nHelp build Typedia as a complete reference by participating in Font Fridays. Doing even just one [good deed](http://web.archive.org/web/20130428134034/http:/typedia.com/good-deeds), then [leaving a comment](http://web.archive.org/web/20130428134034/http:/typedia.com/blog/post/font-fridays-lettering-and-type/), can net you a new prize each week. This week it's a copy of [Lettering & Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20130428134034/http:/typedia.com/blog/post/font-fridays-lettering-and-type/).\n\nDo a [good deed](http://web.archive.org/web/20130428134034/http:/typedia.com/good-deeds)!\n\nTim\n\n",
