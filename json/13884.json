  "content": "I’m in the big challenge of designing a wedding invitation for myself. I want to get it done in letterpress, but I don’t want to get caught in the same old traditional invitations. I have been looking over the Internet and all I found is generic designs.  \nSo I have two questions for you guys:\n\n1. Can someone help me find a good book or website that contains ideas of what can be done for a wedding invitation or maybe not just wedding but over all contemporary letterpress design?\n\n2. I don’t have much experience in letterpress jobs, does anyone know what kind of digital font is suitable for letterpress, any suggestions?\n\n",

      "content": "There is a process by which type that you set on a computer or hand-render can be burned on to a photopolymer plate. The plate can then be put on a letterpress and printed in the traditional way . . . so just about anything you can imagine, can be printed (really fine lines can be difficult). I would find a local press and sit down with them. Many people who own a press today are artists themselves and love a challenge.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Caco. I design and print wedding invitations. I design mostly unorthodox shapes/sizes digitally and then have either photopolymer or metal engravings made from film and print them on my Vandercook SP15.\n\nGimme your email address and I'll get in contact ... I can send you some examples, maybe those will get your juices flowing.\n\nAnd when dealing with a very tactile technique like LP, remember: inks and paper are going to be just as important as what's on the page itself.\n\nAs for type: you can use almost anything you like, although I have a personal fondness (since I like really hard impression) for lower-contrast slabs and transitionals.\n\n"
