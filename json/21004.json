  "content": "I recently designed a logo with a word mark and have had some problems with the font Felix Titling (Open Type). When it's printed on a laser printer the font becomes broken and difficult to read.\n\nI am trying to offer a solution to the client, however they really like the font and want to keep it in their logo.\n\nAny suggestions as to why the font is not printing clearly on laser printers?\n\nThanks!  \nJackie\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [New Logo Vertical 3 colour.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112506/http:/typophile.com/files/New%20Logo%20Vertical%203%20colour.jpg) | 24.33 KB |\n\n",
