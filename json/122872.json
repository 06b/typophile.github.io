I thought it was Bodoni 72, but the capital C has only one serif - not the usual lower and upper serifs.  \nAnyone have any idea what it could be ?  \nSorry about the low quality of the image - I have to work with a scan from the spine of the cover - so no hires images.\n\nThanks for your time and effort :-)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417080831im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bodoni-ish_6233.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Times New Roman Condensed Bold \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Renko](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417080831/http:/typophile.com/user/12000 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
