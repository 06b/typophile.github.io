  "content": "Hello,\n\nI need a font converted from .pfb to .ttf so that I can use it on a website with php, the server doesn't support .pfb fonts but it does support .ttf fonts. I know that this can be done with TypeTool2, but I can't justify spending $100 on it just to convert this font. I tried the demo and it's simply open the .pfb and save as .ttf, but the demo only does 20 glyphs and half of them have the fontlab logo in them, so it's needs to be done with the full version.\n\nIs there anybody willing to help me out? I'll paypal $10 for it if that's any incentive.\n\nThanks,\n\n",

      "content": "FearX, you could also try speaking directly with the foundry from whom you licensed the typeface. They might be willing to work with you, perhaps even giving you the format. Although, on the other hand, their EULA might dis-allow embedding in which case you might be biting your foot. Hmm. Better read the EULA. If embedding isn't mentioned then I would really suggest calling them.\n\n"
