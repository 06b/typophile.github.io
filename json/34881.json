At least the boring Latin script, being alphabetic, can readily serve a wide variety of languages. That is one reason for its wide-spread use long after Latin ceased to be spoken widely.\n\nBefore the Korean alphabet was invented, being literate in Korea meant having to learn a whole different language, i.e. Classical Chinese. The literate elite were secure in their monopoly of knowledge and control of society due to the many years of schooling necessary to learn Classical Chinese. There is no way to readily adapt the Chinese ideographs to writing any other language. If the Chinese script becomes the lingua franca, it can only mean that the Chinese language itself has become the global tongue.\n\nAt least with the current dominance of the Latin script, the individual languages are not threatened. On the contrary, we have examples like the Latinization campaigns in the Soviet Union that were aimed at improving the status of minority languages though the introduction of the Latin script to write them down.\n\nI am all for language and script diversity. A Latin-dominated landscape does not preclude language diversity, but a Chinese-script-dominated one does. That's why I call such a future dark and bleak.

Unless you're talking about Vietnamese or even the Japanese hiragana and katakana scripts, which ultimately derive from the Chinese script, I would be really curious...\n\nI'm not really sure you've thought through the global tongue scenario, if you see nothing wrong with that. English may be considered the global tongue now, but Chinese would have to have a stranglehold on the global population at a level that far surpasses that for the Chinese script to be the global script as well. Since we're assuming that the Latin script to fall off its pedestal, the billions of current English, Portuguese, and Spanish speakers would have to stop writing their native languages and switch to Chinese. Or are you saying that they can somehow find a way to use the Chinese script to write their own vernacular tongues?\n\nThe Chinese script has been dominant in East Asia for millennia; it is part of the cultures of Korea and Japan as well as China's. But it has proved restrictive to the use of vernacular languages in writing, which is why Korean and Japanese both developed their own scripts (in the former case, to the enormous protest of the literati who liked their monopoly on literacy). If there was any way the Chinese script could be used to write Korean or Japanese other than through impractical rebus-based systems, it would have been found sometime during the thousands of years of Chinese-script supremacy. When Chinese characters are used for writing Korean or Japanese, it is for writing Chinese loanwords, of which there are many. Extrapolating to languages that have had less contact with Chinese, I can't see how its speakers would start using the Chinese script other than by abandoning their vernacular tongues.\n\nAll this just to spite the current dominance of the Latin script? The Chinese script as lingua franca has been tried in the East Asian sphere and found wanting. Apologies if the future talk sounds like regression rather than progress to me.\n\n"

Hiragana and katakana derive their forms from Chinese characters, but have passed into an entire different genre of writing system, the syllabary. No one considers them Chinese scripts any more than the Greek alphabet is considered a Semitic abjad.\n\nThe difference is that Vietnamese and Zhuang, being analytic languages with largely monosyllabic morphemes like Chinese, are more suited to a logographic writing system than the agglutinative Japanese. (As an aside, I think the current practice of using a Latin-based writing system for Vietnamese is rather unwieldy.) Syllabic writing systems, as it turns out, are effective for writing Japanese. The Chinese script simply served as a reference point because that was the only 'true' writing they really knew about.\n\nKorean, on the other hand, has thousands of syllables in use and didn't find a workable solution until the featural alphabet Hangul was developed.\n\nThe moral is that each language has different needs that require different script solutions, and a Chinese-style logographic system may very well be the most restrictive and least adaptable one out there, suitable only for a handful of languages in China and Southeast Asia. In fact, the reverence for tradition and resistance to innovation in the world of written Chinese probably contributed to its survival to this age when other logographic systems around the world have been rendered obsolete by phonetic writing.\n\nIf anything, if I trust human creativity, I think the Chinese script will move further and further away from its logographic origins to reflect the changes in the Chinese language away from analytic features.\n\n"

In fact, the unifying* spirit of Chinese (it deftly encodes the numerous languages of China) is exactly what an alphabet sucks at.</cite>\n\nThat's not so simple either, as it is a result of a standardized literary language and spoken languages developing in tandem, and one has to ignore a large degree of diglossia, but let's leave it at that.\n\nIf making cognates recognizable is the goal, alphabets work just fine. Many European languages that use the Latin script use near-identical spellings for Greek and Latinate vocabulary, when the pronunciations are quite different. French in particular uses a lot of phantom letters in their spelling to reflect etymological origins (e.g. the _g_ in 'doi_g_t', cognate to 'digit'). I'd be hard pressed to make out a single word when someone is speaking Danish, but I understand a fair bit of written Danish because of its closeness to Norwegian.\n\nBut a true unifier would be something like bringing back Latin as the universal literary language in Europe, or Sanskrit in Northern India. Pretending that one can introduce a single unifying script for the different languages of Europe à la Chinese without enforcing a unifying language ignores the far greater diversity in grammatical structures and vocabulary between even the closely related Romance languages. Chinese was helped by strong central government starting with the First Emperor, who standardized writing across China; maybe European political unity can enforce a standardized pan-European literary language?\n\nHrant: <cite>Alphabets are seriously over-rated, to mythical proportions; and to see a non-westerner fall for it is frankly quite sad.</cite>\n\nI reiterate, different languages require different script solutions. I am not advocating alphabets as the one-size-fits-all solution. Many nationalistic Koreans talk about the supremacy of the Korean alphabet and even exporting it for writing other languages, so I'm wary of that view.\n\nBut I think it's perfectly clear that the majority of the world's languages simply cannot be written with a manageable logographic system the way Chinese can be. Just how would one distinguish between the dozen different ways of describing 'yellow' in Korean, each with a different nuance, in such a system?\n\n노랗다, 노르께하다, 노르끄레하다, 노르무레하다, 노르스름하다, 노릇하다, 노릇노릇하다, 노르톡톡하다, 노리께하다, 노리끄레하다, 노리무레하다, 노릿하다, 노릿노릿하다, 노리톡톡하다, 누렇다, 누리께하다, 누르끄레하다, 누르무레하다, 누르스름하다, 누릇하다, 누릇누릇하다, 누르툭툭하다, 누르칙칙하다, 샛노랗다, 싯누렇다.\n\nI would rather not lose that diversity.\n\n"

In fact the Korean script (which is not really an alphabet) _is_ superior to every other one, at least in ways that count most. It makes Latin look like a village idiot.

In the latter, more likely/widespread, and much more interesting (but yes, dangerous) is the way Chinese will change other writing systems, as Latin has been doing for so long.\n\n\\> people largely stop writing in non-Chinese languages  \n\\> altogether, using only Chinese for written communication.\n\nI'm not seeing that.\n\n\\> This far surpasses what any language  \n\\> up to now has done, including English.\n\nNot really.

      "content": "Hrant, are you remembering to distinguish between language and script? The dominance of the Latin script and English as a de facto lingua franca are two separate issues.\n\nI call the Latin script dominant not because it has the greatest number of users (the number of users of the Chinese script may already be greater, I don't know), but because it has been adopted by scores of different languages from different language families, including English. The influence of languages written in the Latin script, such as English, certainly played a great role, but the main thing was that the Latin script, being a phonetic system, proved supremely adaptable.\n\nSuch adoptions of scripts are perhaps doomed to be less than optimal most of the time. Latin might not be the optimal solution for Vietnamese, nor the Indic-based Tibetan script (note: another phonetic script) for the Tibetan. But they still produced solutions that worked well enough to stick.\n\nBut you won't see the languages switching allegiance to the Chinese script, even if there is all the motivation in the world to do so. _Chinese-style scripts cannot be used to naturally write anything other than a relatively small group of languages._ If there was any way at all that Korean and Japanese could be adequately written in Chinese, we would have figured it out sometime in the last couple of thousand years when we were firmly in the Chinese cultural sphere and absorbed everything Chinese. Fortunately, human creativity prevailed and we figured out writing systems that were actually capable of writing Korean and Japanese.\n\nOnly a very small number of languages at one end of the morphological spectrum lend themselves to being written with logographic writing systems. Most languages cannot simply switch over to being written in Chinese. A latter-day Atatürk who orders his national language to switch to Chinese writing would most likely be unable to find any linguist capable of carrying out the command.\n\nI'm curious where you are getting your ideas about logographic writing systems if you think they can be readily applied to any language. There are certain advantages to using a logographic system, but written English already shares many of these advantages, being not purely phonetic but having many logographic features. Most languages are probably best served by scripts balancing phonetic and logographic features, and arguably written English has evolved to strike a close-to-optimal balance.\n\n"

Any reasonable phonetic-based script could have taken its place.\n\nBut if we went into a counterfactual history where Chinese culture achieved supremacy the world over--if it were Chinese colonisers instead of Europeans entering Africa, Southeast Asia, and the New World in the last few centuries--the different languages of the world would still not have adopted the Chinese script. Instead, a diglossia would have developed where people would write in Chinese and speak in their vernacular tongues, or more likely the vernacular tongues would be supplanted by Chinese.\n\nAt this point, I'm wondering if you are the one driven by your emotions and false hope to seeing a ready alternative to Latin in the Chinese script when there isn't one. The Chinese script is perfectly suitable for the Chinese language (or at least as much as the Latin is for English), but expecting it to work for languages that don't share the features of Chinese betrays an ignorance of how a logographic writing system works.\n\n"

Would you agree, or am I betraying stunted imagination and creativity?\n\nSo my pointing out the limitations of the Chinese script for something it was never meant to be used for--writing languages other than Chinese--amounts to subjecting you to my supposed anti-Chinese upbringing? You're trying to make this look like a clash between those appealing to emotions, when I'm only trying to point out what I thought was a well-understood feature of the Chinese script.\n\nSo I can only conclude that I have been taking my familiarity with the Chinese script for granted, and others may not understand the most basic feature of the script to the point of harbouring illusions about it being portable across languages the way phonetic scripts can.
