  "content": "Hi !\n\nI'm currently building a list of interesting documentaries about typography for a local design event.\n\nWhile Hustwit's _Helvetica_ is a must-see gem, I realize most people have seen it. Adding it to my program would be okay, but I'm pretty sure there are other quality projects out there.\n\nI already have a preliminary list, but I'd like to have the opinion of the Typophile community. I want to surprise my audience with new films and / or hard to find documentaries.\n\nAny suggestions ?  \nHave you heard of new films coming out soon ?\n\nThanks a lot in advance !\n\n- -\n\n(by the way, excuse my average english...)\n\n",

I recorded a few of those.

The screening will be followed by a panel discussion with Jim Moran, David Shields, Nick Sherman, and John Downer.\n\nAIGA Atlanta is selling tickets for general admission. TypeCon attendees are guaranteed a seat (if you check it off on your registration).\n\nSome folks may remember that Justine Nagan gave a preview of some of the footage at last year's TypeCon in Buffalo. We're very excited to welcome her back to TypeCon to debut the finished documentary.\n\n"
