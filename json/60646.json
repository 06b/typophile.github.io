Please take a look (I can't insert the image for some reason, keep getting errors, so I attached it.)\n\nAs you can see. It's annoying.\n\nYou probably know this but I remind you that there is a limited number of fonts available for websites. So please suggest cross platform fonts.\n\nAlso doesn't have to be just fonts, any recommendations about kerning, line spacing, word-spacing, letter-spacing, drop caps...?\n\nReally, any constructive critic is important to me. I hope to learn more from you all.\n\nSorry for the clumsy sentences. i'm tired.\n\nThank you.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Sample Page.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418230415/http:/typophile.com/files/Sample%20Page.png) | 112.78 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Headers should always be appropriate for the content of the text.  \nIf you don't want this header to be visible as the first thing in the text, you should try using the same typeface, size, kerning and line-spacing as in the main text + two blank verses (1 above and 1 below the headline). The white space created by blank verses will do just fine:) Using small caps is also a good choice, but it's difficult to make it in a webdesign...  \nBut if it's really important for users of this page to notice this headline at once, making it a little bigger than the text (2-6pt) should be enough for w web page. You could also use some color (just keep it warm and it will be visible - red (but not #ff0000 :D) is perfect!  \nHope I helped a bit:)  \n- Filip Łysyszyn\n\n"

But the _style_ of the headers is usually selected to be appropriate to the design of an entire document, first, and then, if a designer wants to change the header for every part of the text, say story by story, it may then be appropriate to choose that style based on the content of that text.\n\nOn the web, little of this is particularly possible along with kerning (none), line spacing(okay), word-spacing(none), letter-spacing (bad), drop caps (hassle).\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you so much for your comments. And thanks dberlow, your explanation makes a lot of sense to me. I followed Lysyszyn's advice and added both space before and after to text and increase the text size. Below is the \"revised version.\"\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418230415im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2009-08-05_1046_4680.png)\n\nThere is still a bit of problem. I read that we should put more space on top of the heading than the bottom so it's closer to the text.\n\nSecondly, the heading still stands out too much. So I changed the color so it's the same with the body text, the heading is now not standing out enough.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418230415im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2009-08-05_1049_3434.png)\n\nAny other suggestions? Or this is good enough (stupid question, but hey...)\n\n"
