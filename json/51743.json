  "content": "This is a new font I'm working on. I wanted to make an elegant modern gothic with a botanical feel to it (if that makes sense). Kind of like a 'Burtonesque' font; romantic yet slightly macabre... As you can see in the example, I used an alternate f in the text previews. I have a few other alternate letters I'm still working on right now. I like to hear what you think of it.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [PMD.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112326/http:/typophile.com/files/PMD.gif) | 5.08 KB |\n\n",
