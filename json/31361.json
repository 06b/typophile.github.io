And I wouldn’t let versions like Type Revivals’ discourage you - they’re WAY off the beaten path.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Mike! FYI, the best reference materials for these faces is the actual films . . .\n\nIn general, all connectting script styles had lowercase forms that had both a low and a high tail ending which made different settings more organic depending on the letter that followed it. We intend to do this with OT automatically …\n\nIn addition, any printed specimen source materials we’ve ever seen had too much press gain which distort crotches where lines met and usually not enough of the character form was captured.\n\nThe process has been fascinating to say the least so far and I hope to begin not only font releases but documentation about the company and the device which I’m working on a book of the complete company history …\n\nBest,  \nStuart :D\n\n"
