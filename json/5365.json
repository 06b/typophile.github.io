Not sure about the Credit card issue though. It's subscription based on a 30 day cylce making even the basic plan far cheaper than itunes. itunes is .99/song (I'm assuming its similiar in the UK).

      "content": "Dylan,   \n   \nDefinitely not. There are moments of repeating sequences, but the rhythyms and variations keep it from getting dull or annoying (like listening to some dance music when you're not in the club).   \n   \nThe DVD has a short (about 12 minutes) film from the original photo shoot with them playing around a bit, and a 53 min film of the resulting live jam session that later took place in front of a large crowd (along with other extra tidbits, including the original video for _Midnight in a Perfect World_). This music is much more organic and evolutionary than the tracks on the CD. Personally, I think it's great. Lots of energy, etc. Maybe not so good for just sitting and watching, but I sometimes work with it in the background on TV.   \n   \nThe CD is a series of remixes by people in and associated with the group that performed with the drummers. The sound is very diverse. It's not all hip-hop-y, or a lot of complicated scratching tricks. The songs are a very unique blend of music that's hard to describe, but definitely transcend the traditional limits of funk, jazz, hip-hop, and any other influence mixed in. I highly, highly recommend it. Even those not typically into hip-hop can find something in it for themselves.\n\n"
