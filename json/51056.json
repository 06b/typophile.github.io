I've read that it is Officina Sans Bold & Roman, but the top of the lowercase \"a\" curves and slopes a little more than Officina Sans, same for lowercase \"c.\" Also, the stems for lowercase m and n are curved a little in Officina Sans while they are squared off in the Amazon.com logo. Any ideas?\n\n",
