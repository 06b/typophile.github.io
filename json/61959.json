  "content": "When setting up kerning classes in FontLab Studio, how do I make use of those left/right checkmarks? I read the manual but I don't understand how I can make practical use of them.\n\nLet's say I've defined the capital A as a kerning class for all accented A's. Like this:\n\n\\_kern1: A' Adieresis Aring Agrave Atilde Acircumflex Aacute Amacron Abreve Aogonek\n\nHow can I apply the left A kerning to the AE? I've always just done a copy from A and paste special, left kerning on the AE. It works, but I'd like to do it with classes\n\nI can see that I can define a whole new kerning class and have it apply to only the left or right side. But the A already has a class defined, I can't define another class for A: it already has a class.\n\n",

According to this, FL should be capable to understand that if a group is marked on its left side it is going to be used as the second letter on the pair (or the first one, if it is a right-to-left script).\n\nWhen I try to explain kerning classes to someone (last weekend and yesterday, just to name the last cases), the other person always get it wrong because of this.\n\n"

In right-to-left scripts, if glyphs are identical on the RIGHT side then it means they will share the same kerning value if they are the 2nd glyphs in the pair.\n\nIn both cases, the 2nd checkbox needs to be activated. It would be far too complex from the UI standpoint to somehow make sure that the checkboxes relate to the left or right side of the glyphs, because that depends on the direction of the script. But if you think about the logical order of the glyphs in the kerning pair, one is always 1st and the other is always 2nd, and this is what the checkboxes reflect. I'd be happy to hear your suggestions how to improve this, provided that the solution will be workable for both LTR and RTL scripts, of course.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Adam, one way to deal with this is defining classes by left/right side of glyph logic, regardless of glyphs' writing direction. Setting a left flag means that glyphs' left sides are similar. Always. Upon (kern) feature generation, lookups' LTR/RTL flag determines whether the translation is left=2nd & right=1st, or right=2nd & left=1st. Not a big thing. In addition, source data for LTR/RTL kerning should be defined and kept independently of each other.  \nMalcolm, OT layout table's logic of 1st/2nd is layout engine logic. There is nothing wrong with it. But personally I think that a left/right logic is more in tune with how designers think: left side of a glyph is the left side of a glyph, regardless of writing direction.\n\nKarsten\n\n"

So, if you want the class to be considered when its members are on the left side of another glyph, click the left check box. But a few times I've got it inside out and thought the bullet represented the members of the class, and the check boxes represented the other half of a kerning pair, either on the left or on the right, which is backwards.\n\nMost of the time I get it right--er--correct. But I think it would be less confusing if the bullet in the middle were removed. Just have the two check boxes, which would then clearly represent the two possible positions in a kerning pair with no third element to muddy the waters.\n\n"

I still think it makes more sense the other way and have to make a very conscious effort to do it the FontLab way instead of the intuitive way every time. Obviously, I am not the only person who thinks left kerning means the space to the left of the glyph in question. Even after 5 years of doing it the FontLab way, I still find it very awkward and illogical. There may be an equal number of people in the world who think the FontLab way is logical--who knows.

We actually have given it a fair amount of thought and decided that the way we have implemented it is more robust, especially in context of mixed writing directionality. I believe changing it now would confuse even more people (the ones who think it's intuitive as well many of those who don't think it's intuitive but have learned to deal with it).\n\nHowever, I think we can try to come up with a different graphical indication of \"the thing in the middle\" so it's more clear that it's the kerning pair that is indicated there (currently by the dot) rather than the glyph.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"

To make a new class parent, right click and create class parent. Select glyphs, drag & drop them on the class parent and they're added to that class. If a glyph already belongs to another class, it cant be selected. However, if you deselected and clicked on that glyph, it would reveal its parent the rest of the class it belongs to. For each glyph, you can turn off left of right kerning. Perhaps there could be a way to make the left belong of one parent and the right belong to another.\n\nThe classes wouldn't be numbered . . . the order is irrelevant.

And yes, indeed, the convention of starting names of classes that are used for kerning with an underscore (\"\\_\") is just a convention used within FontLab Studio. This way, FontLab Studio \"known\" which classes are to be used when it generates the feature specification for the \"kern\" feature.\n\nSimilarly, the key glyph is a concept used within FontLab Studio to simplify the internal storage of data (kerning pairs are \"attached\" to glyphs in FontLab Studio). This is pretty much a remainder of old FontLab 3.x where there was no concept of class kerning. It's possible that at some point, we'll develop a fully new way of dealing with kerning which will not require key glyphs.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"
