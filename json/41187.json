What I’m running into is 18pt Photina is not 18pt Univers. Is there a proper convention of offsetting these sizes so that they line up properly?\n\nAs far as I know there’s only one digital version of each, Monotype and Linotype respectfully, so pairing specific digitizations of these typefaces seems out of the question.\n\nAny advice on this matter is greatly appreciated. Photina italic shreds.\n\n [‹ \"design for non-designers\" guide?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121043249/http:/typophile.com/node/41595 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Sans Serif text face to complement P22 Zaner Pro ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121043249/http:/typophile.com/node/41519 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

When scaled to similar x-heights, regardless of “point size”, things should match up well.\n\nSlimbach’s Utopia also matches Univers remarkably well when scaled to the same size.\n\n"
