  "content": "Just released a nice set of numbers, rescued from a 1838 Type Specimen Book issued by the Fonderie Clement, Bruxelles.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415043158im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ClementNumbers_6258.png)\n\nThe 5 is my favorite, the upper part is unique.  \nI fell in love with it. And so I decided to digitize them all.  \nI hope you enjoy them! I made them with love.\n\nAvailable for download at [http://goo.gl/cgxts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415043158/http:/goo.gl/cgxts \"http://goo.gl/cgxts\") Just $15\n\nI'm not completely sure, but I think that Clement was a Didot's apprentice, who then started his own foundry. If anyone has more info on that, I will appreciate it.\n\nCheers,  \nPablo\n\n",
