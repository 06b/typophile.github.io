For example Goudy and Palatino are good historically, but are tired and overused and there are better typefaces that I want the students to learn. I contemplated for a long time whether to put in goudy, palatino, and Jenson, but opted for Meridian, Sabon, and Scala instead. Weiss is a nice font I might have to include that somewhere.\n\nAs for the sans there are so many that i COULD include that I tried to stay to basic, but sophisticated. Now that I think about it I may take out century gothic and repalce it with Gill Sans.\n\nBOB, Do you think Meta is important to have? What typeface would you take out to make room for Meta?\n\nthanks again\n\nAnymore that you would take out that this group feels is not needed.

Picking things that are trendy hardly seems \"essential\" to me - the last 20 years seem over-represented to me.\n\nI agree with many of the other comments. You really need to include Gill Sans and Optima, and Meta is not a bad suggestion.\n\nI'm not sure I'd include both Century Schoolbook and Clarendon. Pick one, maybe?\n\nWhy four geometric sans serifs and only one humanist sans? I know geometrics are \"in\" but for teaching, Futura alone is adequate.

So even though the history is important the goal is for them to learn how to use typefaces in a contemporary way. The reason I have avenier, furtura and nuetraface is not because it is in, but those typefaces can be used for VERY different situations.\n\nAvenier is fantastic at very small sizes 6 and below where futura would not be as good. Neutra is better at larger sizes and not as good for long body copy. Also futura is good, but it is used A LOT and I want to show there are different geometric typefaces than futura. The same reason I have helvetica, Akzidenz and Universe.\n\nMaybe this is my age, but i feel optima is not the best typeface and would rather them design with other typefaces than optima. My personal opinion.\n\nBauer Bodoni, Caslon Book BE, and Garamond\n\n"

      "content": "From my personal recollection of intro to typography, I remember learning 2 things... a lot of history and a lot of fonts (memorizing as much the day of a quiz)... most of which I forget now. What I didn't learn about (and have learned since, thanks typophile) is the essential building block for choosing and using fonts... such as why are small caps important or what's the different between OSF, LF, and TF. History is important, don't get me wrong. Explaining where particular faces came from, which faces are the grandfathers to all the new digital faces, and how type has developed over time. Are important towards understanding about why faces are like they are and where typesetting practices originated (it's called leading!)...as Goudy is often quoted, \"The old fellows stole all the best ideas.\"\n\nTake a gander at this: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/fontshop/sets/72157604597637021/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020131956/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/fontshop/sets/72157604597637021/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fontshop/sets/72157604597637021/\")\n\nIt's a flickr set from Stephen Coles for Fontshop on Opentype fonts... I think it's a nice introduction to a lot of features that fonts have but are often ignored during the intro to typography stage (which was, for me, more of a primer on history and not technique).\n\nAlso Nick Shinn wrote a wonderful article on getting the most out of a type face, especially one with expert features.  \n [http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/DigginIt.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020131956/http:/www.shinntype.com/Writing/DigginIt.pdf \"http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/DigginIt.pdf\")\n\nI think the important thing is to give your students the tools for using fonts. To understand how and why a particular font is a better choice for a particular problem (like you shouldn't use a display font for setting body copy)... then allow them to make that choice on their own.\n\n"

What if their next design project has Victorian Vintage with lots of Versal or Gutenberg or Punk Rock with Black Type theme, these ones could not possibly convey their meaning and portrait the needed design requirements.\n\nIf your students know about the anatomy of typefaces and some categories or varieties developed through centuries, from Roman Chiselled face (Trajan), Black Text, Round Hand, Humanist, Metal Type, 20th century art movements, to a boom of various digital faces nowadays. And along the way just one significant typeface for them to remember.

I show them design that ranges from clean and sophisticated to corporate to edgy.
