The internet community for which it’s meant is all about communication between young people, and expressing themselves on the net. I’m also redesigning their site, but it all starts with the logo!\n\nI’ll appreciate any comments!\n\nSøren Meisner\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/artologo_01.gif)\n\n",

Something like that ;)\n\nAnd thanks!\n\n\\*s\n\n"

The crossbar on the ‘t’ doesn’t read immediately as a crossbar. The idea is strong and the execution is good but needs further refinement to work.\n\n"

I might be mistaken, though…\n\nAs for the 4RTO, that was on purpose: I tried to make an A that looked almost like 4, emphasising the 1337 aspect of the chat culture and so on… The exit might need some enlargement, though. Maybe like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/artologo_04.gif)\n\nSøren Meisner\n\n"

I’d say go back to the first and rotate the A a little bit more — counter-clockwise — and go. The modulation you’ve added in the strokes doesn’t feel as real or quickly written as the first.\n\n"

      "content": "Miss Tiffany & Engelhardt,\n\nThanks! I have made a smoother transition, mostly by going back to the original and narrowing the line through A and R, but still with a fairly thick crossline in t. The small swash at the buttom of the t is still there — it might help readability, but it also subtracts from the vertical feel of the A, R and t lines being parallel. A bit unsure about that.\n\nI’m not too keen on rotating the A though. As I see it, it doesn’t matter if the A is read as 4, just as long as you read the t as a t at most times. As the logo does owe a thing or two to tags, grafitti etc, ultimate readability is not the real goal.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/artologo_05.gif)\n\nSøren Meisner\n\n"

But if it’s not a problem for you, then stick with it.\n\nEDIT: Though now that I’m looking at it more, i’m not so sure about the A’s crossbar. It feels too narrow before leaving the arch of the legs. I’m staring at it too much.\n\n"

It’s a nice mark, just make sure that if you’re going to be using it at all sizes that it still reads at smaller sizes (that you don’t loose those thinner strokes in the logo type).\n\n"

ISBN: 0-7357-1074-0\n\nIt could help give you ideas with the cloudy grafitti style. Especially look at the paper bag style.\n\n"

Not quite sure about that, but it’s supposed to be — well — cool looking as well as saying communication between young people. I’m afraid it is getting too childish.\n\nAny suggestions/comments?\n\n"

I know you’ve invested lots of time in this one but sometimes when I feel I’m getting a little stuck I just drop the idea and start all over again, sometimes doing that allows me to come with new ideas for the original idea, isn’t it strange the way our brain work?! :)\n\nJust my 0.02 :)\n\nRegards!\n\nAlexis Bellido\n\n"
