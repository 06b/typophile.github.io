  "content": "This project is just in the beginning stages. It's for my brother in law so it's not anything that's on a time limit, it's just something I've began and I'm having fun with.\n\nHe's a commercial real estate appraiser who works for himself. Basically this logo would only be for letterhead, business cards and a cover sheet for the actual appraisals themselves.\n\nHis initials are e and g. He said he'd like to keep his name in it instead of adding an abstract shape. So I'm playing with his initials to create a shape. I like the way the lower case e and upper case G were essentially the same shape when mirrored.\n\nObviously number 1 is just getting the letters on there and the rest were taken from there.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts?\n\nA tagline will be added below with the full company name, but I'm not there yet.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [EdBrand2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019042750/http:/typophile.com/files/EdBrand2.pdf) | 673.45 KB |\n\n",

These treatments feel too \"luxe\" to me, and don't seem to fit \"commercial real estate appraiser.\" I'm just playing free-association and throwing out some concepts I would like to see expressed in a new direction: business, confident, informed, value, industrial, serious, etc.\n\n--  \nNick Hladek\n\n"

I appreciate it.\n\nI haven't had time, or needed to go back to these because my sister and he just had a baby.\n\nI still feel like I have something with number 5. I feel like it's the most structured. You're right Nick about some of them not feeling like “commercial real estate appraiser.”\n\n"
