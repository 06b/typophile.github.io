  "content": "An interesting typographic chart on the front page of “The Arts” section in to-day’s NY Times (p. E1). In that chart “each word is scaled proportionally to the number of times it has been used in acceptance speeches at the last six Academy Award ceremonies.” The largest-size word is... “ **thank** ”. All words in the chart are set in Matthew Carter’s excellent [Times Cheltenham](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033318/http:/www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/business/media/21PAPE.html?ex=1141880400&en=1d9e57039abe6674&ei=5070). The chart was designed by [Jonathan Corum](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033318/http:/www.13pt.com/projects/nytimes) of The New York Times.\n\n [‹ Stone Carved](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033318/http:/typophile.com/node/18391 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type Battle!

The home page originally was more like [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033318/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/browse/),with the guide bars in green. I liked that better than the current home page.\n\n"
