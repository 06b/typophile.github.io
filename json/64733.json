  "content": "Hey All,\n\nLong time peeper, first time poster. I've had a client request an editable PDF so they have the ability to edit email addresses etc. as necessary. The only process I'm aware of that would provide anything close would be providing a Word template, either built custom or produced from an InDesign plug-in.\n\nHas anyone got any other suggestions? What's the best method to use? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Colin\n\n",
