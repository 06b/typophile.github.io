Just the other day I read a tutorial describing a way to make vector tribal art with Adobe Illustrator. Wouldn't you know it? I can not for the life of me find the article. I've looked in all of my Adobe Illustrator mags, Photoshop User, Layers, Before and After UGH!\n\nWould anyone be able to point me in the right direction? Your assistance is VERY much appreciated.\n\n",

If you watch anything on Discovery/Comedy Central/you-name-it-channel, you'll see examples. The client? Product Managers. They've come to us to apply that same look and feel to a line of backpacks/messenger bags. They described one of the looks should resemble 'tribal art'. I immediately thought of the 'symmetrical baroque grunge' look that you mentioned. It just so happened, I had received a magazine of some sort that had a step by step tutorial on how to achieve that very look. However, with all the magazines I get, I can not for the life of me locate or replicate that tutorial.\n\nI gave them something as the turnaround of the project was a couple of days. My personality will not allow me to settle for what was given, so I decided to investigate more in-depth on my own.\n\n"
