Its content (the entire article, or chapter, or book) is loaded from a database and the front end presents it as pages in a spread.  \nThis started out as an experiment using baseline grids on the web; then on-screen readability. Over the past couple holed-up weeks here at home I dirtied my hands on the emergent technologies of the new internet, specifically HTML5's canvas element, CSS3, javascript libraries such as Mootools and jQuery, and RSS.\n\n",

I haven't yet determined how the layout engine will handle image scaling, cropping and placement, but I'd like to integrate an algorithm that produces interesting grid-based results, and allow for human input and correction of the design. One feature I'm considering that could appeal to designers is output to PDF in imposed signatures, to create booklets.\n\n"
