Most typefaces aren't designed to do so though, and will probably result in a less than optimal effect.\n\nHave a look at these:\n\n• [Gothic Outline Title](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015558/http:/www.fonts.ru/ustore/fonts/Gothic-Outline-Title.htm)\n\n• [Helvetica Neue Std Bold Outline](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015558/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003273)\n\n• [Gill Sans Std Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015558/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003305)\n\n• [Augustea Open](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015558/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=LFT2345000)\n\n• [Smaragd Std](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015558/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003323)\n\n• [Academy Engraved](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015558/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=LFT1052100)\n\n• [Monotype Old Style Std Bold Outline](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202015558/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003319)\n\nA google search will turn up even more.\n\n"

The width of the stroke will be determined by the size of the router bit in your engraving machine, and you just need a centerline to guide it. PostScript Type 3 fonts allowed for stroked designs. You might happen upon some in very old font packages (earlier than c. 1990), but Type 3 fonts are rare, and stroked ones even more so.\n\nI'm not sure that Type 3 can even be produced by currently available font design software, as this and the ability to include color were the only advantages the format offered once Type 1 was made publicly accessible.\n\n"
