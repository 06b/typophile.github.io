  "content": "I haven't been able to figure this out-\n\nAfter adding a few new characters to the font I'm working on, I reprinted a testpage with the updated font. Several glyphs near the end of the character set shifted two places to the right. That is- in the glyph palette (Illustrator), the font is the same except for the newly appended characters. All the unicode and other names are the same (and correct),  \nbut on my testpage: ^ became ?, and 1925 became 3e(swash)47 (alternate #s). Other characters between these were not affected.\n\nAnyone have any idea why this would happen? Is this a mistake I can learn from, or just a random glitch?\n\nThe font is .otf, and I haven't added any extra Opentype features.\n\n",
