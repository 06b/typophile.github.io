  "content": "Hello, I am wondering if anyone has used or is using this new Universal Type Server by Extensis. My creative department has been using LinoType Font ExplorerX for some time now and it isn’t bad, but I feel we should be on a server based system so we can track usage and purchases and what fonts we actually own and which ones are download by some HACKS! hahahaha!\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated. If anyone is in the Boston/NYC area I would love to check it out in action too!\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Pixel (Flash) Fonts VS Illustrator CS](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121182306/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44755 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Overlapping Tails ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121182306/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48101 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
