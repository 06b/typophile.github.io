Additional labeling isn’t required for your Advent calender.\n\nAll the figures are especially drawn for the wrapping paper, so that they all show to their advantage in the specific pattern as well as possible. Furthermore, every one of them is set in a specific style. They offer enough varieties on a journey through different typographic ages like classicism or baroque—till the final Christmas Eve.\n\nWe consciously left out colour in a first step, therefore you have enough scope for your individual design, using ribbon or to tie bows after your fancy.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/advent_calender_typographic_wrapping_paper_03_6404.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/advent_calender_typographic_wrapping_paper_09_5732.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/advent_calender_typographic_wrapping_paper_05_6040.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/advent_calender_typographic_wrapping_paper_06_5099.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/advent_calender_typographic_wrapping_paper_07_5387.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/advent_calender_typographic_wrapping_paper_08_3864.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/advent_calender_typographic_wrapping_paper_11_5128.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/advent_calender_typographic_wrapping_paper_10_3630.jpg)\n\nThe wrapping paper is printed offset in solid black on 70 g/m² matte coating paper and consists of 24 sheets (for every figure 1–24) in format 17″ × 12,2″ or 8,5″ × 12,2″ which is now available in [Frau von Zahl Shop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423195016/http:/en.dawanda.com/shop/frauvonzahl \"typography wrap Paper for your Advent Calendar\") at DaWanda.
