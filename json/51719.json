  "content": "Greetings friends!\n\nI have been a illustrator for quite sometime now and a pro graphic artist + photographer for about five years.  \nHowever I am clearly new to the art crafting fonts. Don't get me wrong I know the rules of good type habits, but what I want to learn is how to draw them from the ground up.\n\nThings I need help in\n\nWhat type of pen or pens should use?  \nWhat kind of brush is worthy?  \nWhat type of calligraphy pen is good for the job?  \nI can not think of anything else, any other information would be appreciated.\n\nThanks folks!\n\n",

They flow freely and give you an unimpeeded relationship to the paper.\n\nPentel Cartridge brush, the freedom from dip and a good stroke for the money.\n\nBooks are another animal... check with John Neal Bookseller. He has a great selection.\n\nMichael\n\n"
