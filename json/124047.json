  "content": "Hi, new to Typophile\n\nJust uploading some work I've been doing, hoping for some criticism. I'm still working on kerning and special glyphs as well as different weights. I'm hoping to maybe get this to market in a few years (wishful thinking, I know). It's called Bhambu. It's made for body text and I think it's pretty easy on the eyes even at smaller sizes (9-11pt). Let me know what you guys think.\n\nThanks,\n\nJamie\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bhambu-1.008.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150330022610/http:/typophile.com/files/bhambu-1.008.pdf) | 112.13 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "The large \"r\" in the alphabet to the left looks normal, but all the \"r\"s in the sample text have the top left serif pulled down below the x-height. What's going on with that? The version used in the sample text is too distracting and looks bad in my opinion.\n\nOther comments:  \nI like the shape of the c. The t looks a little too narrow, and the crossbar seems to be placed below the x-height: this looks weird to me in the word \"taciti\" and some other contexts. In the sample text (but not in the large alphabet) the bottom bowl of the g looks squished; I can't decide if I like it or not.\n\n"
