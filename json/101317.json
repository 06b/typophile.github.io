  "content": "Speaking as someone who's not a type designer, can any of you explain the rationale behind not grouping font families? Ungrouped families are incredibly difficult to work with in InDesign, especially when there are a lot of weights. Grouping seems to be the norm (at least that I've noticed?) so it's always jarring to come across one that isn't grouped.\n\nSo, is it a conscious decision to set the files up like that? A technical limitation with the software used to create the font?\n\n",

There are probably more worthwhile endeavours.\n\nI used to use a free tool called TTX to dump out font tables in XML, not so much to solve problems, but to explain to others why things don't work in a particular OS/application.\n\nI think in ancient times, applications such as Quark would intervene, but it seems like a losing game because it doesn't really fix things at the generalized font level. Perhaps it will work for you over the interval at which you care.\n\nLet us know if you get it working.\n\n"

But thousands of font families where planned before there was an app called InDesign and it’s not as simple as activating a check-box somewhere to make the grouping work in a way that is compatible with each and every software.\n\nBy the way: What makes ungrouped families “incredibly difficult” to work with in InDesign?\n\n"
