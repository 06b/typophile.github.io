  "content": "i was thinking today... you know you see those catchword fonts sometimes that have logotypes like \"the,\" \"for,\" \"of the,\" \"and,\" etc. I was thinking i would like to come up with some kind of list that lists some of the most common. I'd like this list to be multi-lingual, too, including any language that uses the latin alphabet and actually has catch words (articles and prepositions mostly i guess). Anyhow, looking at LettError's Salmiak (and racking my own brain) i got:   \n   \n**English**   \nand, the, of, at, RSVP, etc., www., com, dot, inc., ltd., of the, for   \n   \n**Spanish**   \nel, la, de, del, de la, por, para, por el, por la, al, a la   \n   \nso there's a bit of a start. if anyone could help compiling this list (or correcting my Spanish) please tell me your catchwords. thnx for looking.\n\n",

It looks like the FF catchword fonts cover some English, Spanish, French & German. maybe there's some Italian in there too? I can't tell. I'd like to go a bit broader if I could.   \n   \nmaybe i would have made myself more clear if i had just said \" [logotypes](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321005302/http:/www.fonts.com/fontent/fontent_home.asp?nCo=AFMT&con=fyti_logotypes)\" instead of \"catchwords.\"\n\n"
