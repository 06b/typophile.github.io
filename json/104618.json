That's clearly not solving this case and you're probably not after this kind of answer but could be easily redrawn from Futura: /C finials \"à-la-/G\", lowering /H crossbar, highering /A crossbar  \nMore alternatives: **[Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823045225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/erbar)** (could work as it, probably the closest I could get), [Simplicita](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823045225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/semplicita-pro) (quite same issues as Futura), [Simplo](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823045225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/simplo) (same issues as Futura + /R off), [Journal Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823045225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/journal-sans) (/K and /R off)\n\n"

      "content": "Hmm, thank you! Yes Futura of course seems close, and fitting with Chicago's Miesian history, but its those sleek lower crossbars. Sadly yes could be re-drawn but I would love to set a whole drawing set in it -- with different weights -- not just a few words.\n\nNeutraface is close for a contemporary re-make, I think ... still looking for the \"heritage\" version though ...\n\n"
