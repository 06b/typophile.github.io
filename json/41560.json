They suggested I put up a couple of my options and get some feedback. I am going for an organic, free flowing form. I want something that is not too serious looking and is delicate and beautiful.

Not to be mean or anything (sorry) but after reading that I had to see for myself! Funny. Sorry. But seriously...I think it’s beautiful in a doilyish way, which I also consider delicate. Nice work. How to improve it?...I concur: Simplify.\n\n"

My first thought was, “Hmmm...neat idea. Is this part of some new the-artist-formerly-known-as-Prince-inspired trend out in California? Is it something an artist develops for him or herself, or is there a potential market for these sort of things among tragically wealthy and bored metrosexuals?” Either way, to simplify or not to simplify is all a matter of style.\n\nOn the other hand, if it’s something you’d like to appear more like a typographical element, like a letter of the alphabet (which to me would be really cool and very difficult), then it’s got a long way to go. It’s far from Caslon or Helvetica!\n\n"
