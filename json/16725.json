I’m trying to get through The Elements of Typographic Styles, and I have a few other books. But please let me know if there’s another book that I should check out.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "One good technique for learning type usage and combination is documenting what is around you. Take pictures of things that work. thats what it is all about; what works. Photograph a magazine layout that is striking, or a book that reads easily, or signage that clearly communicates. When the time comes for you to solve a type problem you will have a reference library. It is good to have work not to copy but to emulate. Observe what the artist did in terms of combination of type styles, proportion, spacing.\n\nIt is good to know what the masters think about type usage and combinations. It is also important, in my opinion, to see what others are doing; type in action. What does/doesn’t work.\n\n"

Every serious typographical work which has to convey complex information on several different levels requires a systematic approach which helps both the designer (to organise the content) AND the reader (to understand the content easier), and this applies for a book and for a signage system in the same way.\n\nKunz’s own work (which is also shown in this book) is clearly based in modernist Swiss typography, and this is where the reader has to be a little bit careful. Whereas his work - which I consider to be brilliant - perfectly exemplifies that introducing order and logic into typographic design does not mean that creativity has to suffer, it is nevertheless in a specific style, and the reader of this book is well advised to copy methods rather than the resulting style.\n\nTsongtze, let me know whether you find the book useful.\n\n"
