(“Horde” instead of “Hoard.”) It is too early for spelling.)\n\nSo, I’m curious how you all manage your font collections on your com-put-ers. Do you purchase/download any and all fonts you can get your hands on? Do you pick and choose only the finest that you can find? A combination of the two?\n\nI ask because I have a ton of fonts, some of which aren’t exactly of the highest calibur, but I can’t bring myself to prune them. I wouldn’t feel so bad if I knew others were. :D\n\n [‹ Looking for hedera/aldus leaf...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106234449/http:/typophile.com/node/36236 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Clearview in the NY Times Sunday magazine ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106234449/http:/typophile.com/node/35972 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Right now, I’d prefer to buy small, essential families then work my way up by selecting high quality type from other foundries; however, at the time, I went ahead and purchased the Adobe Type Collection. Though expensive and it has some junk, I should be fortunate to have many high-quality families and the best well-known classics (though often overused) to choose from. In the end, though, I’d still rather pick and choose type from other foundries because there’s some amazing typefaces out there. Ah well.\n\n"

If so, then prune out the weeds from your font list. You can’t do good work with bad tools.\n\nSince the dawn of DTP there seems to be a competitiveness about font acquisition. It’s like a contest, where the guy with the most fonts wins. The free and warez font sites seem to feed that.\n\nI’d rather have 100 good quality fonts than 5000 poor quality ones. Over 95% of the free fonts are . Now, if you paid reasonable money for fonts, you should never completely eliminate them. Archive them to a CD if they have gotten old and tired, as some have, but be ready to spring them back to life when you get the project that will be perfect for that particular look.\n\n"

I do this mainly with Font Explorer as well, but I’ve trashed a few fonts as well.\n\nBut more importantly, stop before you download and think “is this really going to give me something I don’t already have or have in a better form?” I do this, in part, by avoiding free font dumping sites and sticking to foundries and designers who also make commercial type.\n\n"

Then I added gradually: workhorse text fonts that I use all the time, project-specific fonts (usually display fonts) that are archived and might never be used again, and beautiful typefaces that I didn’t really need but couldn’t resist buying because they happened to be on sale you never know, they might be perfect for a project one day.\n\nI don’t use a font manager. I manually add/remove fonts from the active font folder as necessary. Generally have only a couple of dozen fonts active, mostly text fonts (as my job is typesetting books).\n\nI have pruned the odd font that proved disappointing. Although I try to buy only from reputable foundries, I’ve been burned a couple of times with supposedly pro-quality fonts that were badly kerned or, as I’ve discovered now that I purhased Typetool, have outlines that resemble bad autotraces that were never cleaned up. Of course I steer clear of those folks now.\n\nI don’t think I could ever have too many typefaces.\n\n"

Someday when I get one of those round tuits, I will go back and check some of the old fontplays for bad letter spacing.

And if you have a deadline, what price can you put on headaches?\n\nAnd with a couple timely purchases (for very little money), I have enough good fonts to design up a storm, if I had a clue about what I was doing.\n\nBut I’d definitely keep an eye out for sales, like that half-price sale one of the designers was doing last week. I have a bit of bargain hunter in me, that thrills in an extra good deal.  \n; )\n\n"
