I tried that with the Cetnaur we have now, and it looks and reads much better.\n\nI applied a 5-horizontal, 5-vertical bold effect, nothing else changed. My question is: Even though what I did looks good, what would the more experienced users/designers recommend? A little more bold? A little less? And finally, is doing this a good idea? It Seems a bit blasphemous, but effective all the same. Could this be the solution - all that is needed to \"fix\" Centaur, Bembo, and other unfortunates? Or is my inexperience getting the better of me?\n\n",
