Here it is used in a credit union logo, but I’ll post additional samples as I find them. Any thoughts?\n\n [‹ Identify this serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204121506/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46813 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Jackass Font ID ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204121506/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46816 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
