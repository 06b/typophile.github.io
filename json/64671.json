  "content": "Limited edition wall calendar featuring twelve original illustrations by Post Typography. Each month presents a different interpretation of the number \"2010\" through a wide variety of inventive, meditative, and eye-popping lettering treatments and illustrations. More fun than those other boring type calendars out there, and even non type/lettering nerds can appreciate it.\n\nWe've got fewer than 100 copies of this left... once they're gone that's it.\n\n[http://www.posttypography.com/site/index.php?action=capital&id=795](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417092355/http:/www.posttypography.com/site/index.php?action=capital&id=795)\n\n[\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417092355im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PostTypography_2010_calendar_big_4712.jpg)\n](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417092355/http:/www.posttypography.com/site/index.php?action=capital&id=795)\n\nPS- Yes, we know the illustrations are not technically \"typographic\", but it's just easier to describe that way. Cool?\n\n",
