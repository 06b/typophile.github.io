I have given up trying to get these morally bankrupt jerks from selling my freeware fonts on various compilation CDs because there are just to many people who consider other people's work found money.\n\nThe only people that ANY licensing arrangement is going to guarantee honesty of is HONEST people. The a\\*\\*h\\*\\*\\*s don't care how well your EULA is worded; they will steal you blind at every opportunity.\n\n"

I think you'll find that most would be happy to share this with you - consolidating EULAs is something most designers see as a good thing.\n\nWhen Ascender's Bill Davis was at Agfa Monotype he went on the road offering AMT's EULA text to foundries - so Monotype Imaging may be a good place to start.\n\nWhatever you decide I'd recommend bringing the chosen EULA back here for a critique.\n\n"
