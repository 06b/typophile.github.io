I'm sure other fonts exist with other names, any would do, but I'm thinking it's time to retire the old girl and replace her with a good, clean opentype face. Any suggestions?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221211843im_/http:/typophile.com/files/aaa_4555.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [aaa.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221211843/http:/typophile.com/files/aaa.jpg) | 49.17 KB |\n\n",
