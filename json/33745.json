I have actually done that.\n\nThe history thing - that’s something I’m really into. If I’m working on a book that’s grounded in a particular era it is important to me to either use a font that is clearly of that era, or consciously not to. In other words be aware of the font’s history in relation to the project and not just choose something that looks good.\n\n"
