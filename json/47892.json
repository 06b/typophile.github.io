  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am a type enthusiast living in Sydney Australia, and have been frustrated by the lack of organisations and interest groups inspired by our wonderful world of typography.\n\nRather than get frustrated, I have decided to do something about it, and am going to establish an informal club called **The Australian Typography Club**. Inspired by organisations like [The Typographic Circle](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.typocircle.co.uk/), and [Type Club of Toronto](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/typeclub.com/), the purpose of our club will be to promote choosing, using, and creating great typography.\n\nThe short version of this thread is that I am seeking advice and direction regarding:\n\n- setting up a typography club\n- knowledge of the type scene in Australasia\n- general guidance\n\nIf you can help, please read on!\n\n==================\n\n**ABOUT ME**  \nIn the world of typography, I am just another keen user (a mere nobody). What's worse, I write quite messy (but that's another thread). I am however a very capable person, and run a publishing design studio in Sydney. I will make sure The Australian Typography Club succeeds.\n\n**ABOUT TYPE IN SYDNEY**  \nFor the past couple of months, I scoured high and low to find any sort of organisations, group, or course concerned with type. Bonus points for anything in Sydney. Results:\n\nThere is [The Australia Graphic Design Association (AGDA)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.agda.com.au/). Many have their views on AGDA - and I have heard them being described as inaccessible or irrelevant. Most importantly, I do not believe there is a focus group concerned with typography. To be honest, I'm a little hesitant to contact these people.\n\nThere is an online community [Australian INFront](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.australianinfront.com.au/). This is a great online only community, with respect of typography.\n\nEducation-wise: There are the usual type subjects taught as part of tertiary courses. Various industry short courses also exist, for example run by [AFTRS](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.aftrs.edu.au/aboutus/contactus/nswact.aspx) \" [Typography for the Screen](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.aftrs.edu.au/courses/industryshortcourses/findacourse/typographyforthescreen.aspx?iteration_id=5803&PEPICourseID=138)\". Oh dear, but this is run in Melbourne.\n\nIf you're aware of other organisations, groups or courses relating to type in Australia, please let me know!\n\n**PURPOSE OF THE CLUB**  \nThe mission of our club will be to promote choosing, using, and creating great typography.\n\nOn a day-to-day level, the purpose of the club would be to create a real-life community for type enthusiasts to meet, collaborate, and learn. Meetings would be held periodically (in my studio if needed), where Australian typography enthusiasts of all ages can discuss choosing, using, and creating great typography.\n\nAs a 27 year-old, I have a personal interest to get younger professionals / uni students involved. The type scene exists in Australia. There's a type gene in our DNA - we just have to get together.\n\n**ESTABLISHING THE CLUB**  \nAs an informal, not for profit, general interest club, I would imagine that the membership would steer it's direction over time. It however firstly needs to be established.\n\n**The following are 3 issues I would love advice with. Please help!**  \n========================================================================\n\n**==\\> Issue 1 of 3: What is Australian Type?**  \nWhen it comes to type, Australia is no New York or Amsterdam. Heck, we're only 220 years old. Compared to other cities, there is little historical culture. How can we define Australian Type? What is it? Is there such a thing? Where have we come from, and where are we going? Is it even important that there is such as thing as Australian type?\n\n**==\\> Issue 2 of 3: Attracting the right leaders**  \nWe would love to attract respected and knowledgeable type industry leaders to be involved in the club in some way. Those in Industry, type designers, foundries, educators. Who are these people in Australia?\n\nFrom Industry:  \nDevelopers: I am aware of Elliot Harper, Chapter Rep of the [Sydney Adobe InDesign Users Group](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.indesignusergroup.com/chapters/sydney/). Also [Mike McHugh](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.creativesweettv.com/), Creative Systems Engineer at Adobe - a fantastic Adobe CS trainer.\n\nAgencies: My knowledge of type specialist in design agencies in Australia is limited. There are of course highly respected agencies like [Frost Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.frostdesign.com.au/), and others specialising specifically in type, magazine and newspaper redesign. Problem is: I am not aware of who the gurus are.\n\nType Designers / Foundries:  \nUnfortunately drawing major blanks here. [Kris Sowerby](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/typophile.com/user/1519) of KLIM fame is from New Zealand. That's the closest I get.\n\nEducators:  \nThey lurk around teaching courses in places such as [Billy Blue](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.billyblue.com.au/) and TAFE Enmore amongst others. They know their stuff. With more homework I can find out these peoples names', but would love some help.\n\nAttracting these people involves inviting them to contribute at meetings with talks, help set up the club, or merely come along for the ride, if they're at all interested. Remember it's about choosing, using, and creating.\n\n**==\\> Issue 3 of 3: Getting members to join**  \nGet issue 2 right, and this one should be quite easy.\n\nFor industry professionals: word could spread with the right seeds planted.\n\nFor young professionals and uni students, from first hand experience I know there are plenty of young enthusiasts out there. Promoting typography to up and comers is only positive for the industry. Quite easy and effective to contact design colleges, I also hear a community announcement on FBI radio etc.\n\n==============================================================\n\nSo all in all, I'm keen to hear any words of advice, direction, or comments about the ambition for The Australian Typography Club.\n\n...especially in relation to the **3 issues raised** , and names of people / type designers / foundries / gurus.\n\nIs there anyone from other type clubs who also could provide advice?\n\nThanks for any help and advice.\n\n\\*edited to expand scope to Australia (was initially Sydney based only)\n\nUpdate:  \nA [Forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/forums.australiantype.org/viewforum.php?f=3) has been established. Please help out if you can!\n\n[http://forums.australiantype.org/viewforum.php?f=3](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/forums.australiantype.org/viewforum.php?f=3)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Nathan. Great idea and I'm all for it. Trouble is I live in Melbourne. I've been travelling to Sydney on PR consult jobs this year, but I'm only there for a few days at a time and it's very hard to convince my employers to let me have any time off for things like type club meetings, or anything else for that matter. Mainly I'm employed as a brand consultant, AD and writer.\n\n_There is The Australia Graphic Design Association (AGDA). Many have their views on AGDA - and I have heard them being described as inaccessible or irrelevant. Most importantly, I do not believe there is a focus group concerned with typography. To be honest, I’m a little hesitant to contact these people._\n\nMe too. I've had some contact with AGDA in the past and found them rather inaccessible and largely inactive. Certainly they didn't express much interest in typography.\n\n_Type Designers / Foundries:  \nUnfortunately drawing major blanks here. Kris Sowerby of KLIM fame is from New Zealand. That’s the closest I get._\n\nI'm one of Melbourne's indie type designers / font manufacturers. There are others here, but I've had no contact with them, largely by choice because I'm very indie and like to work on my own, figure it all out for myself. Now that I'm established I'm getting more comissions, and I may be about to sign a deal with a high-profile indie retail / custom type outfit in London, who I cannot name at this time.\n\nOne other Melbourne type designer is Graham Meade:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/meade/graham/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/person/meade/graham/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/meade/graham/\")\n\nI'm not sure where the following people are located:\n\nJan Schmoeger:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/schmoeger/jan/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/person/schmoeger/jan/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/schmoeger/jan/\")\n\nWayne Thompson:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/thompson/wayne/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/person/thompson/wayne/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/thompson/wayne/\")\n\nJesse Andrew Tilley:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/tilley/jesse/andrew/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/person/tilley/jesse/andrew/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/tilley/jesse/andrew/\")\n\nIn Sydney there's Russell Bean:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/bean/russell/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/person/bean/russell/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/bean/russell/\")\n\nThere's a list of Aussie type people at Myfonts:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/country/au/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.myfonts.com/country/au/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/country/au/\")\n\nOut of all those people, the fonts I've made appear to be the most serious as far as typographic design goes.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/arboghast/james/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223947/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/person/arboghast/james/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/arboghast/james/\")\n\nI'm not prolific, and the best is yet to come, but out of the two main retail fonts I released last year, all two of them made the Typographica best fonts of 2007 list. I figure that's a good sign. I'm just moving into text fonts now.\n\nFor the time being it's best if you ask me what I can do for you and your endeavor. I'm happy to talk about it here online or we can converse by email.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

I could put an exclamation mark after that but it would be pointless. Stephen Banham lives and works in Melbourne, in case you didn't know. I first heard of him five or more years ago when he began his anti-Helvetica campaign. Letterbox is not a \"foundry\" by the way. It's a font making outfit.\n\nWhat makes you think we did not know of Stephen Banham? Thanks man, you're all heart. Perhaps Nathan knows of Stephen Banham too but also omitted to mention him. People have reasons for omitting to mention things and it shouldn't be at all surprizing. It has to do with being human and making errors.\n\nHave a great day Kris!\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

If you read thru my post again, I wasn't upset with Kris for posting the link to Stephen Banham's website, not am I jealous of Stephen or Kris in any professional sense as type designers. My only concern there was how we act as professionals on this board, that we avoid making personal remarks and reading between the lines, making assumptions and so on.\n\nCarl—I can understand it may seem odd to you, but I don't have the monetary means to go jetsetting and attending Typecons.

Just keeping my day job going is a struggle. Establishing and running a type business as James Yencken and Jonno Bellew have done is not possible for me.

So amazing, so inspiring, and so much fun. I’m already saving my pennies for next year._\n\nTypecon is a type trade show where (this year for instance) 400 of the 470 attendees were there to flog their wares. A certain amount of commercialization is neccessary to support industry conferences, but still I find it hard to get enthusiastic about paying $350 (add a few grand in airfares and accomodation on top of that) to go to a convention where more than half the presentations are of no consequence or interest to me, and where most people are consuming alcohol. That turns me off, because I don't drink. I'm a smoker and I'm damn proud of it. The other problem for me with Typecon is I'm no type nerd. I'm an artist and a writer.\n\nNotwithstanding, I think Typecon is great for the people who like and enjoy that kind of thing, and I wish SOTA and the Typecon people all the best in future gatherings. Everything has its place in this world. I don't dislike Typecon nor am I anti-Typecon or anti-Type nerd. It just isn't for me.\n\nAt least I don't think it is, but I would very much love to be convinced otherwize. Typophiles you are most welcome to turn me around on this. Convince me. Tell me why I should go.\n\nBut enuff sour grapes. It's telling that James Yencken, a designer, knows of other designers interested in typography as well as actual type designers in Melbourne. I'm out of touch with the design scene since I mainly work in public relations, as a writer of business collateral, creative concepts for ads and some corporate branding. I have kept my interest in type going however by forging a career as a typeface designer and font maker. That's not well supported by my daytime contract work, but I guess I can't have everything.\n\n_I wouldn’t jump right on the AGDA hate bandwagon fellas._\n\nI appreciate what you are saying there, but your choice of words has a polarizing effect. Leave out \"hate\" and \"bandwagon\" please. \"Hate\" is a dangerous corrosive word and we're all better off not using it. It has a corrosive effect.\n\nThe opinion I expressed of ADGA earlier is based on contact I made with them and their utter lack of responsiveness. They didn't return my any of my calls or emails, and I made quite a few of them. I am very professional in my business correspondence, much more professional than you may see me from time to time in online discussions at Typophile. I made the effort to establish repore with ADGA repeatedly and got nothing in return, not one word, not one call back. What else am I supposed to make of that?\n\n_They put on some good events and the people in charge in Melbourne are a young progressive bunch._\n\nGood for them and I wish them all the best with their endeavors. Sorry, but in my estimation they have a colossal amount to learn about professionalism and how to communicate.\n\n_They would almost definitely support any kind of type initiative; but everyone involved in AGDA is also a busy designer with limited time._\n\nI think you should speak for yourself, and let them speak for themselves. And James, please take all of what I'm saying in good faith as it's meant that way.\n\n@Pat Armstrong: _PS.

Thanks for the link Pat : ^ )\n\nI watched the Helvetica film for the first time on DVD in my hotel room a few weeks ago when in Sydney. It was the most boring documentary I've ever seen. Nothing in it about Helvetica I didn't already know. It's a boring font and a boring subject. The only interesting person in _Helvetica_ is David Carson.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Type designers contribute and showcase their work here. (I am a publisher and can produce the yearbook cheap but nice.)  \n--- admission to type events  \n--- other stuff (provided by supporters)  \n--- tshirt? (may need to bump up membership), but need to keep it down too\n\nA website link will be published on this thread when the time is right, where others can help with Phase 1, and become part of the core founders. There's no way I can do this on my own. ETA: 1 week.\n\nKeen to hear any other opinions, thoughts + advice. Thanks!\n\n"

At this stage all I have to go on is what people say about Typecon and what I can see in photos of the event each year. Obviously attending one in person will make the picture much clearer for me. I'm sorry I generalized, but that is human nature. As for my opinions, well, I am not sorry for having opinions based on observation from a distance. Fact—people tell me Typecon is packed with nerds. That isn't my opinion, it's what people tell me, including people who have been to Typecon.\n\nWhat else am I supposed to think? At least I'm thoughtful enuff to come here and test this generalization, the reason being I don't want to believe it either : ^ )\n\nThe point about alcohol consumption is that I should feel comfortable in a social context, and it is a bit hard to feel comfortable if I'm one of the few people not drinking.

I'm very keen to help with that stuff.\n\n@Nathan  \n_Agencies: My knowledge of type specialist in design agencies in Sydney is limited. There are of course highly respected agencies like Frost Design, and others specialising specifically in type, magazine and newspaper redesign. Problem is: I am not aware of who the gurus are._\n\nWhat baffles me is why so few of Australia's type specialists or gurus show up at Typophile. Typophile can seem bewildering, elitist, even offputting at times, depending on the topic being discussed. But it's an international community with a lot to offer, and to be part of it you have to roll with the punches and take a tolerant, long-term view. You (Nathan) and other Aussies have done that. You made the effort and now you're getting something really great in return. I've had my darker moments and occasional loss of faith, but in the end I stuck with Typophile. I'm still here.\n\nSo where are Australia's big shot type people? Why aren't they Typophilers? This curious dearth of Australian presence puzzles me.\n\n_The Sydney Typography Club_\n\nIs it going to be named that, or The Australian Typography Club, or The Australian Typographic Board as David Sudweeks is suggesting, or something else? Irrespective of where meetings and events are held and where the organization is headquartered, naming it The Australian Typography Club (or something similar) will go a long way towards securing membership from every state. I saw the _\\*edited to expand scope to Australia_ bit, so does that mean we can substitute each instance (or most instances) of \"Sydney\" with \"Australia\"?\n\nOne thing I'm not into is the notion of Melbourne as Australia's culture capital. Currently I don't subscribe to that view, even tho I unwittingly repeated the myth several years ago on the page about me at Planet Typographie. Sydney is a very cultured place, no less so than Melbourne, just different. I hope you and other interested parties in Sydney can see beyond the Sydney versus Melbourne thing too, because it's a load of bunk with the potential to derail a national type society.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
