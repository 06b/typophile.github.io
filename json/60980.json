You may be right that stretching horizontally is less detrimental than condensing – at least the contrast pattern stays comparably comfortable. The variance in stretch maybe seems almost more disturbing than the stretch itself (like comparing the two bottom lines – \"biologically\" seems a lot more \"normal\" than \"determinations\" no?).  \nI think it also looks \"good\"/\"fun\" in a very 1989 sort of way. Dunno – looking at that headline (and those O l i g o n u c l e o t i d e s ! ) today, and as a type designer, would you still do that?\n\n"

I'm trying to reconstruct my design process.  \nI think that I was using the variety of stretching to \"massage\" text blocks to fit the layout, and the variety of stretching, and type styles, served to disguise that \"cheating\".  \nFor instance, the really wide drop cap was done to optimize the justification of the first paragraph.  \nAnd the three squared-off items were stretched to fit the space they're in, with nice margins.\n\n_...in a very 1989 sort of way..._\n\nYes, it was supposed to look new, advertising a new piece of scientific equipment, and stretched type signified new at the time, the DTP meme.
