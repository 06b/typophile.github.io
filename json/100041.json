Depending on time period of your sample, could be the original Mercator that Atlas Grotesk is based on: [http://typophile.com/node/53257](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823141526/http:/typophile.com/node/53257 \"http://typophile.com/node/53257\")  \nThis /a reminds me of [Akkurat](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823141526/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/).  \nQuoted from Atlas Grotesk description text\n\n> The aesthetic of Atlas was inspired in large part by the sans serifs of the 1950s, specifically Dick Dooijes’s Mercator, released by the Amsterdam Type Foundry in 1957.\n"
