If we assume the type was eroded by the poor image quality Helvetica Ultra Compressed could be it.\n\nI have also just noticed that starting from the medium weight the tail on the R in [Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202045441/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-pro/) takes on a Helvetica-like appearance (but the middle arm on the E is also too low).\n\n"
