  "content": "We've just released a new font based on old metal type called Foundry Ornament, which features heraldic creatures and floral designs from old metal type. The first font of this sort we've done in more than a year, and the result is very appealing.\n\nWe also just made available a major revision of our classic Tuscarora font, which has been quite popular but is now upgraded with additional alternate characters and an expanded character set.\n\nSamples of both are attached and you can check them out along with new articles and features at [fontcraft.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203011844/http:/www.fontcraft.com/).\n\nDave\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203011844im_/http:/typophile.com/files/foundryornamentmf_6515.jpg)\n\n",

I love your fonts, they all have unique feeling.\n\nA have a comment about your site.  \nIt's pretty hard to navigate through site, maybe that's only my oppinion, but you should develop more user-friendly site.\n\nHope you won't have anything against my comments, I wrote honestly what I think.\n\n"
