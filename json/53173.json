  "content": "Go easy on me folks - this is my first typeface.\n\nIt's based on a Spurred Egyptian I found in an old book. It's not complete yet - still a few glyphs missing - but I think it's finally getting there.\n\nI've been staring at it so much in the last couple of weeks that I'm loosing my objectivity.\n\nThe first PDF shows what I have so far. The other two are examples of the font in use.\n\n[http://www.terremoto.ca/Font/Spurred%20Block%20Standard.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417193622/http:/www.terremoto.ca/Font/Spurred%20Block%20Standard.pdf)  \n [http://www.terremoto.ca/Font/Gunpowder%20Can.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417193622/http:/www.terremoto.ca/Font/Gunpowder%20Can.pdf)  \n [http://www.terremoto.ca/Font/Map%20of%20the%20Universe.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417193622/http:/www.terremoto.ca/Font/Map%20of%20the%20Universe.pdf)\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback.\n\nDan\n\n",
