The text is in “ [Now Sans Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828031841/http:/typophile.com/node/16147)” and the bold is a new design I just started called “Lozenge”. Lozenge is actually half of an ego/alter-ego pair of fonts that are very similar but one is wonkier and one is more normal—kind of a leftbrain rightbrain thing.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
