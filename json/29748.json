Fortunately, Helvetica already has Greek and Cyrillic versions, and [Helvetica™ World](http://web.archive.org/) includes a specially-designed Hebrew Helvetica in its OpenType character set. But Linotype also offers a number of CJK fonts that can be matched with Helvetica.\n\n**Chinese fonts that pair well with Helvetica:**  \n [DF Hei](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.linotype.com/110191/dfhei-family.html) _(Simplified Chinese)_  \n [DF Hei](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.linotype.com/110207/dfhei-family.html) _(Traditional Chinese)_  \n [DF Li Hei](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.linotype.com/110368/dflihei-family.html) _(Traditional Chinese)_  \n [DFP Hei](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.linotype.com/110533/dfphei-family.html) _(Simplified Chinese)_\n\n**Japanese fonts that pair well with Helvetica:**  \n [DF Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.linotype.com/110162/dfgothic-family.html?DSESSID=&PHPSESSID=a04b0657aaf1e74cf0314ee8b3f82f6c)  \n [DF Gothic P](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.linotype.com/110152/dfgothicp-family.html?DSESSID=&PHPSESSID=a04b0657aaf1e74cf0314ee8b3f82f6c)  \n [DFHS Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.linotype.com/110223/dfhsgothic-family.html?DSESSID=&PHPSESSID=a04b0657aaf1e74cf0314ee8b3f82f6c)\n\n**Korean fonts that pair well with Helvetica:**  \n [DFK Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.linotype.com/110320/dfkgothic-family.html?DSESSID=&PHPSESSID=a04b0657aaf1e74cf0314ee8b3f82f6c)\n\n"

      "content": "I realize I'm coming into this very late, but for future reference, buying the fonts directly from Dynacomware is _much_ cheaper than from Linotype, at $25 a pop. They're one of the cheapest type foundries for East Asian stuff (if not _the_ cheapest), and they offer packs of fonts at a further huge discount as well.\n\n[http://www.dynalab.com/Products/Wheretobuy/DynaComwareGlobal/tabid/645/l...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/www.dynalab.com/Products/Wheretobuy/DynaComwareGlobal/tabid/645/language/en-US/Default.aspx \"http://www.dynalab.com/Products/Wheretobuy/DynaComwareGlobal/tabid/645/language/en-US/Default.aspx\")\n\nNote that for Japanese, Morisawa's Medium Gothic BBB was actually packaged with Helvetica for a long time. They have since replaced it with a proprietary face in the OpenType version of the font (Helvetica was seen as having glyphs that were a wee bit too small and heavy), but it's still very close to Helvetica aside from the _a_ (has a cut-off tail like in Arial or the heavier weights of Helvetica, but otherwise it resembles Helvetica's _a_ more than Arial's), the _g_ (double-story), the _r_ (the top is a little shorter), and the _y_ (the tail curves a little differently).\n\nHere's a comparison of the two versions:  \n [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Gothic\\_BBB\\_sample.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217121307/http:/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Gothic_BBB_sample.png \"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Gothic\\_BBB\\_sample.png\")\n\n"
