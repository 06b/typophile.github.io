The font for Home Brew Good God is a later style that mixes this with features from other styles such as the extended flat bottoms & tops on D and B first found in a font patented by James Connor in 1878\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422054839im_/http:/typophile.com/files/D9433_18780808Connor_4473.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"
