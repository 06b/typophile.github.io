  "content": "Hi everybody,  \nI'm working on logo for an online community of mothers, which will be used as a marketing research tool. It is called \"A Fish in the Water\", which suggests that the people will feel comfortable there. I like the idea, you get the fish n the water, sense of being part of something—community. Only problem is that I'm not sure if I've seen a similar idea somewhere, I don't think so, but you probably know the feeling, you've seen so many logos, that you're not sure if this image wasn't just stuck somewhere at the back of your brain. The only similar identity i recall is one for Tackle Design by Fredrik Lewander, but it is different enough. Thanks. Jan\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015222248im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fish_4068.jpg)\n\n",

As for resemblances, it does remind me a little of the work Chermayeff&Geismar did for the Oceanario de Lisboa (sorry, I don't know how to insert a link), the Tennessee Aquarium or the National Aquarium in Baltimore.\n\nBut don't worry, I think your logo is unique enough and I can really see the community in there.\n\n"
