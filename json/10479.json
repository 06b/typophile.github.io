This time I figured I'd learn from the experts and scoured almost every post on the serif board, reading the advice people gave to others and applying it to this font (worthwhile, but quite time-consuming). I think it's worked out...  \nReally, I'm looking to see if this is good, bad or ugly before I start working on the bold and other bits.\n\nAnd I still haven't thought of a name yet.\n\nBen.\n\n"

I'm not an expert, but here is my critique:\n\nI will make thinner the arm of the 'r' (the part the joins to the stem) at the moment seems too thick. Make also the right serif a bit longer as well.\n\n'c' seems to narrow. The loop of 'g' as well.\n\nThe numerals need some work. For example the ranging 3 and 5 are too prominent.\n\nYou're getting in there.\n\n"

I'm thinking that making the bowl rounder and stiffening the ear will probably help it.  \nAnd the j wasn't particularly well formed to begin with. Initially I didn't have the serif on the bottom but it just looked like it was missing a serif. I might try a few things like basing it on the top of the f or maybe just 'stretching it back out'.\n\nOh, and I still haven't thought of a decent name yet.\n\nBen\n\n"

      "content": "First: It's nice to see somebody scouring old crits to learn stuff; that's the mark of a craftsman. Second: This is quite good for a first text face! Some of the glyphs (like the \"a\") have a lot of maturity. With some polish it'll be a winner.\n\nMacro stuff:  \nSome of your corners seem confused, or indecisive. Like the bottom-left of the foot of the \"a\"/\"d\", and inside of the top serif of the \"c\". Considering how nice -I think- your general angularity is (like in the spur of the \"b\") I would just make those sharp too.\n\nMicro:  \n- I'd thin out the top bowl-stem join of \"d\".  \n- The top-right of \"e\" is too light.  \n- The tail of the \"j\" needs to... morph! :-/  \n- In the \"k\", that join is too choppy.  \n- \"s\": a bit wide, and top-heavy.  \n- \"t\": the head is way too timid.  \n- The tail of the \"y\" is out of character.\n\nCaps: Your proportions are nicely classical (although I'd make the \"L\" a bit narrower). And for some reason the tail of the \"J\" seems to work here, I think; so does that stub in the \"K\". But the disjoin in the \"P\" isn't working - although I think it is working in the \"R\". The \"Q\" though seems entirely too 19th century. I'd make the \"U\" a hair wider, and the \"W\" slightly wider. BTW, you're using my favorite form of \"B\"!\n\nNumerals: the head of the \"1\" is best for making the numerals fixed-width (which right now they aren't); and its base could be a lot stronger. The \"4\" and the \"7\" need more presence I think. The OS \"4\" isn't working.\n\nOthers: the Pound has an unusally strong top, but I think it's cool. The Florin should slant. The \"a\" in the At should be smaller. I'd remove the x-line tick in the Eszet.\n\nThe Italic is quite refreshing, and its distinction from the Roman balanced very delicately, very... 21st century - wonderful. There's something old about it, like in its long diagonal serifs, but also something new in its ampleness and gentle slant (which I like a lot). Interesting, the \"f\" with a partial descender; I'm glad you've left the flourish out. The \"k\" might need to be less Art Deco. The \"&\" is a flop.\n\nSpacing: assuming you keep the nice slight darkishness, I would tighten it all up a bit.\n\nOverall, quite encouraging!\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "More micro crit. Either the bottom bowl of the 'u' doesn't go far enough below the baseline, or the lower right tail goes too far, or maybe a little of both. At very large sizes, the curve of the left side of the 'e' doesn't seem to match up (try temporarily removing the crossbar to see what I mean). Righthand bowl of 'R' could probably be a bit darker.\n\nRighthand bowl of 'm' may join the middle vertical stroke too low, although maybe this is the effect you were looking for. To my eye, it's a bit asymmetrical.\n\nItalic 'agy' seem a bit wide. (btw, 'vwxy' are very nicely executed! I may have to steal ideas from those). I personally miss the lower left tail on the 'f', but again that's a matter of taste. The curve on the top arm of the 'k' stands out to me - you'll note it's backwards from the curve you usually see on a Greek kappa.\n\nMisc characters. The two-stroke '$' seems especially dark. Either going to a single stroke or pulling back on the darkness of the serifs would fix that. Braces aren't very curvy, a pet peeve of mine. See how I dealt with those in my [Century Catalogue](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123034144/http:/levien.com/type/myfonts/pr-Century-Catalogue.pdf). The florin has a similar problem - the segment of the central stem which is perfectly straight should be shorter. The eszet seems topheavy, but I think that could be fixed by making it a bit narrower (especially the 's' part of the glyph).\n\nSpacing on the italic could use some adjustment. rbearing on 't' is too loose, on 'i' too tight. ge is too tight 's' seems a bit loose. I think you've overkerned the 'ke'.\n\nOverall, very nice!\n\n"

I've also slightly expanded the character set (although some of the ligatures may not make it to the final version).\n\nI must admit I'm still not 100% happy with the tail of the y, but I think it's going in the right direction (metaphorically speaking). The number of different approaches I've tried is quite astounding (second only to the ear on the g, which I have spent far, far, far too much time tweaking and changing).\n\nI think I've improved the tail of the j, as well as the tail on the Q, although I'm not totally sure about it yet. Does it work? Also, is the new italic ampersand good or does it look a bit too uncial? Is the italic k working?

The head of the \"t\" is out of character. The \"Q\" is... interesting. It might work, but I'm not sure.\n\nItalic: I'd give the leg of the \"k\" some pizzaz. That ampersand is novel, but I have to doubt it's good enough. The little Roman alternate is cool though. Italic spacing: a bit loose.\n\nYour blank space is too wide in both Roman and Italic.\n\nI might just remove the tick from the long-s.\n\nThat's it for now, sorry...\n\nhhp\n\n"

These are extremely minor.  \n-bowl of P too big  \n-make the top of the q bowl rejoin the stem as a hairline (don't rethicken it)  \n-maybe lighten lower bowl of g a tiny bit  \n-make the t a bit more chiral at the bottom left; also maybe a bit less smooth up top (maybe)  \n-x a little out of balance  \n-perhaps s also a little out of balance  \n-zero could be a bit more square  \n-tail of the italic g seems out of harmony for some reason--maybe not  \n-I can't shake the feeling that the italic f should come all the way down, or at least some farther.  \n-italic a needs more chirality  \n-rethink top italic k arm serif ?  \n-black k too lo-fi at join  \n-perhaps give black C,c a smidgen more underbite  \n-you mistyped \"black italic\"  \n-pi too narrow  \n-Euro could use a little more underbite  \n-maybe don't rethicken tail of eng (not sure what you would do about Eng in this case--perhaps treat it like y)  \n-what'choo want an etc ligature for?\n\nMost of these are so minor I can't even definitively say if I'm actually seeing them or not.

Of course there are several little tweaks and adjustments to be made, but I'm afraid that no matter how long you work on it, you'll always find someone who'll tell you to improve something else. In a sense, no typeface is ever perfect or 100% finished.\n\nI'm not really in a position to criticize your design and can only hope to be as good as you one day. However, my overall feeling is that this face looks somewhat \"generic\". The capitals have quite a lot of personality, as someone else pointed out, but the lower case just looks very good and clean and well-behaved, without looking personable or unique.\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is, if this was just an exercise in type design, you should give yourself an A+, summa cum laude.\n\n"
