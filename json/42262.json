  "content": "Hi\n\nThis font is one from an archive of fonts we have (it’s called ’StampComp’). It’s perfect for my title on front cover of a book, but I’ve discovered there are no apostrophes, hyphens or colons so I can’t really use it throughout the book for chapter headings.\n\n(I have a funny feeling it was an amateur experiment because it looks like impact with a distressed stamp effect).\n\nDoes anyone know where I can find a full set of this font (I’ve tried the usual suspects like myfonts with no luck), or suggest a good alternative?\n\nMany thanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [stamp\\_sample.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090710050356/http:/typophile.com/files/stamp_sample_0.jpg) | 109 KB |\n\n",
