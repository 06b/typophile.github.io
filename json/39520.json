  "content": "Dear Fellow Typophiles,\n\nIn the middle of November I was commissioned to design and execute  \na fresh Finnish–Arabic–Finnish Dictionary for general readers.  \nSince my knowledge of non-Latin scripts is restricted to classical Greek  \n– and some Russian – there are major difficulties to surmount.\n\n(1) Technical issues  \nIt is well known that the localized Adobe InDesign ME supports right-  \nto-left scripts, but are there any cunning methods of importing Arabic  \nto the standard version (i.e. Adobe InDesign CS2, English, Mac)?  \n(2) Aesthetical issues  \nThe choosing of Arabic typeface seems somewhat outrageous. (e.g.  \nsome kufic fonts seem appealing to me, but I doubt whether they  \nhave any connection whatsoever with lexica...)  \nThe Latin scripts of our book might be set with ‘Linotype Trajanus’ or  \n‘Brioso Pro’, which do possess certain calligraphic flavour.  \n(3) The lack of Arabic skills  \nIndeed, shall I have the temerity to accept this captivating commission?\n\nAny suggestions or comments will be highly appriciated!\n\nSincerely,  \nP. L.\n\n [‹ FF Kievit alternatives and companion](http://web.archive.org/web/20071129234548/http:/typophile.com/node/39453 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Road Signage Dissertation-Please Help ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071129234548/http:/typophile.com/node/38445 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But even within that you have varieties. Of course, I would be happy if you decide to choose my Arabetics Mehdi font family :)\n\n\\>\\>(3) The lack of Arabic skills Indeed, shall I have the temerity to accept this captivating commission?\n\nWith some help from a local college student, yes you should.\n\nGood luck. -Saad\n\n"
