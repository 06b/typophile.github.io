More precisely, the descenders of f, g, j, p, q, y in Roman and Italic are sqeezed or crippled such that they do not (or almost not) go below the base line enabling extremely non-leaded typesetting.\n\nI uploaded a sample page here\n\n[http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/luke.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20080925090715/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/luke.gif \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/luke.gif\")\n\nIt seems to me that this KJV Bible edition, which is a reprint, was originally typeset using the foundry type or hot-metal type of Antique Old Style No. 3, which seems to be a modification of one of the various Bookman fonts.\n\nQuestion: Is this curious Antique Old Style No. 3 available as a digital font?\n\n [‹ Alternative(s) to Kingfisher](http://web.archive.org/web/20080925090715/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49778 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for complementary font to Arial for WEB ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080925090715/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49751 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
