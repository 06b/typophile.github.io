Or is »Traffic Type Spain« just a similar commercial version of the original typeface? (Like Interstate is for FHWA fonts)\n\nAbout Spain I just found this statement:  \n»En España, según la norma 8.1-I.C, se deben usar dos tipografías que se adjuntan dimensionadas con la norma. Para la señalización en autopistas, autovías y vías para automóviles, se utilizará el alfabeto denominado Autopista; mientras que para las carreteras convencionales, el entorno urbano y el resto de vías se usará el alfabeto Carretera Convencional.  \nExiten versiones comerciales de las dos fuentes. La versión del alfabeto Autopista es la fuente Highway gotic, y del Carretera Convencional es Traffic Type Spain1 .«\n\nCan anyone help to translate?  \nI guess it means they use a font called »Autopista« (based on Highway Gothic) and font called »Carretera Convencional« which is equal to »Traffic Type Spain«.

      "content": "La storia è un po’ complicata e confusa. La segnaletica stradale & autostradale si basa su convenzioni (relativamente) internazionali, che riguardano anche il carattere. L’Italia dagli anni sessanta ha adottato il carattere disegnato (dal 1957 al 1967) appositamente per l’uso stradale in inghilterra. Il progettista che ha disegnato la segnaletica e il carattere in uso è Jock [Kinneir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.designmuseum.org/design/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert) (e Margaret Calvert), il carattere è appunto il [Transport](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/familytree.html) (URW, 1980).  \nLa normativa della segnaletica italiana (quanto mai deprimente) si trova in qualunque edizione completa del _Codice della Strada_, che la riporta integralmente con tutti gli alfabeti prescritti. L’avevano fatta certi ingegneri del Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici, dei quali uno forse si chiamava Cecilia.  \nIl sistema progettato da Kinneir e implementato nel 1963 è un segno di durabilità stilistica.

      "content": "ok, here is the translation:\n\n\"The story is a bit complicated and confused. The road and highway signage is based on relatively international standards, that also involve the fonts to be used. From the beginning of the '60s Italy used the font designed (from 1957 to 1967) specifically for street signs in the UK. The designers of the sign layouts and the of the font in use are [Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.designmuseum.org/design/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert), and the font is [Transport](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/familytree.html) (URW, 1980).  \nThe laws on Italian signage (quite depressing) are on any complete edition of the Italian \"Codice della Strada\" -Manual of road laws and rules, that has specimens of all the alphabets to be used. Some engineers from the Public Works Department, one of which maybe was called Cecilia, worked on it.  \nThe system designed by Kinneir and implemented in 1963 is an example of stylistic durability.  \nIn an [article](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-09-1/contents) called \"Roadside traffic sign\" (originally published on the British magazine Design No. 178, 1963) Anthony Froshaug proved that there was no reason for an improvement of that signage system.  \nThe Italian license plates are designed by the [IPZS](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.ipzs.it/scheda_prodgraf_ocv_en.jsp), the Istituto Poligrafico.  \nIn Spring 2003 the Triennale in Milano hosted a very interesting show called \" [Asfalto](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/architettura.supereva.com/sopralluoghi/20030324/), the character of the city\".\n\nin my researches though, i found that [Traffic Type Spain D](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=traffic+type+spain+d) (from an unknown designer), as it appears here is a lot closer in look to what appears on the Italian highways than Kinneir's [Transport](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/d-bold/), (1957-67), even in its [Heavy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tss/workingdrawings/alphabet/) variant.  \nwhat my opinion is, is that the font that is being used took its shape from Kinneir's original design (the similarity with it is out of doubt), but was redrawn and applied without consideration of what were the lighting and optical problems concerned.\n\ni will let you guys (that for sure have a lot more typographical experience than i do) judge these images, but please let me know your opinions!  \na.\n\nBelow is the comparison between:  \n--\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340im_/http:/typophile.com/files/big_card_telepass_4468.gif)\n  \n1) what appears on italian road signs (in particular this one is from the highway)  \n--  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340im_/http:/typophile.com/files/transport_bold_3937.png)\n  \n2) Kinneir's Transport Bold (preview from myfonts.com)  \n--  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005340im_/http:/typophile.com/files/traffic_type_5370.png)\n  \n3) Traffic Type Spain D (preview from myfonts.com)  \n-- \n"

For conventional streets,</cite>\n\nBasically, the autopistas and autovías are what in the US would be called Interstates. They are the roads which are designated with either an A (Autovía, such as A-6) or AP (Autopista, AP-41). The primary difference between these roads is the design standards (APs are newer, with easier curves and more straight areas with better on and off ramps) and that the Autovías are free to use, while the AP charge tolls. Carreteras are equivalent to US-highways or state roads, and are designated with an abbreviation for the province plus a number (e.g. M-30)\n\nThe MAIN difference I've seen between the two fonts used in Spain is that Autopista (the font) uses a straight bar tilde over the N in Ñ, whereas the Carretera Convencial uses the squiggly tilde and that Autopista tends to be spaced a little bit looser.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».
