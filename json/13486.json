Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221225455/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) as a printing technician. After [Mergenthaler-Linotype GmbH](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221225455/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mergenthaler-Linotype%20GmbH) acquired D. Stempel AG, Hoefer remained with the company, eventually ending up in the marketing department.\n\nHoefer is very active as a volunteer with the [Klingspor Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221225455/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingspor%20Museum). Hoefer also raises donkeys and mules in his spare time.\n\nHoefer is the son of the famed calligrapher and type designer [Karlgeorg Hoefer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221225455/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Karlgeorg%20Hoefer).\n\nPlease note that, although the German o umlaut (ö) may also be written out as \"oe\", Hoefer's name is _actually_ spelled with an oe and not an ö!\n\n",
