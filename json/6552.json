  "content": "Hi all,   \n   \nI'm designing layouts for a coffee-table book of very organic photomontages of the rainforest. Some images have text incorporated in them, and some may even have text that spills onto the page.   \n   \nI'm not a typographer by any means; but I love type and I'd so appreciate suggestions for a text face that could complement such images. Something versatile, with a nice big family? Flourishes... It may (or may not) even be appropriate to experiment with fleurons (mmm...fleurons...) to complement the face.   \nSomething like ITC Galliard? Anything by Lanston Type ? (divine fleurons!!!) I love their Jenson Oldstyle but I think I need something with true italics.   \n   \nAny suggestions you could give would be greatly appreciated!   \n   \nThanks in advance,   \nKaisa\n\n",
