  "content": "We are branding a bank services company called 21st Century Financial Services or \"21CFS\" They provide back end data and transaction processing services to banks. They are the bank behind the bank so to speak. They desire to be a progressive company with new technologies and a unique nearly-paperless process. I am looking for a typeface that could be used in their mark as well as have a wide enough bredth to cover multi-medium usage. I have attached the first (extremely rough, I might add) draft of the logo ideations to help with your suggestions. Our initial thoughts are to look for a semi-serif or sans typeface (like Scala maybe), but I am open to suggestion. What are your thoughts?\n\nBeau\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [21CFS\\_LogoIdeations\\_v2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024052747/http:/typophile.com/files/21CFS_LogoIdeations_v2.jpg) | 30.36 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hi BeauSim\\>\n\nWhen I look at this logo... my brain immediately says \"credit union or real estate\". The brick red and slate gray used together are a soothing combination. The flower imparts warmth as well. While this is a good thing, in this context- I think not. The logo is very friendly and connotes maybe personalized service. But I think you are going in the wrong direction.\n\nThe organic 'look' is not about strength and reliability. Its about warmth and the human aspect of things.\n\nSo where should you go?\n\nThere are fonts with a clinical feel, such as Univers- emotionless and used rampantly in corporate identities. Then there are fonts such as Manuscript- very rough and organic- not powerful. You need something in between... a humanist sanserif.\n\nYour initial idea of Scala is pretty good to me. But I wouldn't use that particular font. Its getting too much play these days and you want your logo to be unique for a very long time. I think the font for you is FF Absara Sans. Its powerful yet its forms are not so clinical that you can't convey 'the human' aspect.\n\nScala, Kievit, Charter, Dederon, Caspari, and Richmond are also nice choices. And genreally speaking FontFont has excellent fonts. Stay away from Dax, Meta, and Helvetica.\n\nI would also change the colors to be stronger... maybe blues or cardinal reds. More saturated. Something that gets your attention with out slapping you in the face.\n\nHope I'm helping you,\n\nMikey\n\n"
