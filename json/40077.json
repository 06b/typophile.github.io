  "content": "Well... I am formatting a book, and despite showing him a couple of options, my dad still wants to use a sans serif font. I posted here last week and got some good suggestions for serif fonts, but it looks like I won't get to use them.\n\nI'm a bit nervous about this since it goes against traditional book typesetting wisdom, and also because sans serif can be very modern and sometimes \"cute\", which wouldn't really fit with the subject material of this non-fiction book.\n\nSo, what I am looking for is suggestions for:\n\nSans serif fonts that are classy looking and would look nice in large amounts of text  \nOR (this next one is in case I can compromise with him)  \nSerif font, but that is not very complex and uses minimal serifs (something he will look at and think looks very readable- his idea of readable is basically sans serif).\n\nThanks for any help.\n\n",

It might be a little too casual though for your purposes.\n\nHow about Weiss? Is is a serif font, but the serifs are small. An elegant typeface and good for books.

At first I didn't like that, but then it grew on me, and it actually became easy to read.\n\n"

      "content": "As was brought out in the last thread, the text in this book isn't the most important thing.\n\nThat alone takes you outside \"traditional,\" at least, if you consider the first 450 years \"more important\" to \"tradition\" than the last 50 years.\n\nAny number of photography books use a sans. If you ask on this forum, you'll get a range of suggestions. As you pour over the suggestions, consider this.\n\nThe designer Richard Eckersley, in his last 10-15 years, was quite fond of Trinite, and used it for many books. His good friend Rich Hendel (another designer, author of <cite>On Book Design</cite>) loved the look of Richard's designs with Trinite, but could never get it to work in his own designs. For a similar look, he'd probably use Quadraat. This isn't all that uncommon a phenomena. Rich Hendel uses Arnhem quite often, and I've set many books in Arnhem that Rich designed -- you would think I understand it by now. But when I have to design a book, I can't get Arnhem to work quite right, even if I steal Rich's design pretty much in full. When Arnhem would be right but I have to do the design, I usually switch to something like Charter.\n\nWhat matters in a book, whether the text is important or not, is that the book is a physical object. There are spacial relationships you have to attend to. They are there whether you take a traditional approach or not. The \"right\" typeface is one you develope some comfort in working with. Think on it -- there is no magical typeface. If there were one, we'd all use it. The magic comes from your ability to understand how it works (fits spatially), and use it.\n\nIf you've never heard of Richard Eckersley or Rich Hendel it doesn't really matter; the point is they were/are very, very good book designers, who worked enough years to see many changes in both fashion and technologies.\n\n"
