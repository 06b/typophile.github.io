  "content": "Font Production Workshop and Type Critiques Added to TypeCon2002 Schedule.   \n   \nBUFFALO, NY, APRIL 26, 2002 - The Society of Typographic Aficionados (SOTA) has announced additional special programming available at TypeCon2002. To be held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, July 12-14, the fourth annual event is presented by SOTA and The Type Club of Toronto.   \n   \nDigital Font Production 101 is aimed at beginning type designers looking to develop or refine their technical skills. This hands-on workshop covers such topics as the basics of letter fitting and kerning, and hinting and building fonts using Fontographer. Q&A and one-on-one assistance are included in this session. This workshop is intended as an overview for the beginner in the correct methods of preparing fonts for potential distribution - it is not geared toward experienced font designers.   \n   \nHosted by Bitstream, this workshop will be held on Friday, July 12. This session is limited to eight participants, with space available on a first-come, first-served basis. Attendees must be registered for TypeCon2002 to participate in this event. The cost for DFP101 is $100USD/$160CAD. Lunch will be provided.   \n   \nBack by popular demand, Matthew Carter and John Downer will be available for individual type critique sessions during TypeCon2002. Critiques are limited to a single typeface/family per person, and are available to registered TypeCon2002 attendees on a first-come, first-served basis. Sign-up sheets will be posted beginning Friday, July 12. There is no additional charge to participate in these sessions.   \n   \nAs a reminder: the early-bird discount on conference registration is available until May 1, 2002. Current pricing for students is $60USD/$95CAD and $100USD/$160CAD for professionals. During regular registration (May 2 through July 1), prices will increase to $75USD/$120CAD for students and $125USD/$200CAD for professionals.   \n   \nTypeCon2002 will take place at the Courtyard by Marriott in downtown Toronto. Discounted hotel room rates are available to conference attendees.
