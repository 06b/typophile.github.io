My guess is that most British publishers would still have used a serif face (possibly even with oldstyle figures?), whereas American books might have something more modernist, maybe a slab serif or Franklin. But which ones?\n\nIf anyone knows of scanned images of such things, so much the better.\n\n [‹ pfb & pfm fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080127071928/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30208 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type on the Nintendo Wii ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080127071928/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30194 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
