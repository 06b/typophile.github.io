  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am developing a new website for a hairdresser chain in Germany and I wonder if I'm on the right track. Please have a look at [the website](http://web.archive.org/web/20110208144245/http:/rub.designbits.de/) and let me know what you think could be improved.\n\nThe logo was developed years ago by another company so there's no way of changing it. The typeface I chose is Helvetica but I'm not sure if it will render OK on Windows machines. I'm also keen to know if the price list is well formatted or if it should be given more structure.\n\nSorry for the site being in German only, but you should be able to get the gist of it.\n\nThanks for any feedback!\n\n[Link to Website](http://web.archive.org/web/20110208144245/http:/rub.designbits.de/)\n\n",

Maybe you could add the red from [their wall](http://web.archive.org/web/20110208144245/http:/rub.designbits.de/images/banner_blankenese_buddha.jpg) to your colour scheme to spice it up a bit.\n\nDefine typefaces in your css like this: {font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans;}\n\n"

I also added three street maps which took me about a full day to develop (please let me know what you think).\n\nChris, I changed the font-size in the main menu from 1.4em to 1.3em. Does this improve things at all?\n\nAny further feedback is really appreciated!\n\nHere's the [Link to the Website](http://web.archive.org/web/20110208144245/http:/rolfundbernd.designbits.de/)\n\n[Webdesign Portfolio](http://web.archive.org/web/20110208144245/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n"
