      "content": "The most basic reason I can think of is to help the reader find his or her place in a book, especially if the title is on the verso and the section or chapter name is on the recto. Another reason would be if a page gets separated from a book, to easily identify it.\n\nBut here's an article on running heads, by John D. Berry, which goes into a lot more detail: [How to deal with those little scraps of text on a page that tell us what document we're reading, and where we are in it.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021221418/http:/www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-running-heads)\n\nWhy at the top? Berry writes, \"There's a practical advantage to keeping both the running head and the page number at the top of the page. If the text may end at different points on different pages, or if you might need to add a line or cut a line at the bottom of the page to avoid a widow, then a running foot would draw attention to these variations; a running head would not.\"\n\n"

      "content": "The John Berry article noted above pretty much says it all. That's a good place to start.\n\nKeep in mind that each book's needs have to be considered; there's no one-size fits-all way to handle running heads. I'm looking at a recent book done here. On the verso we placed the part-title rather than the chapter title. No folio on the verso. On the recto, only the folio. Why? I'm not sure. Probably as Berry remarked: sometimes we just do these kinds of things to running heads for something \"different\" or \"noticeable,\" to prove we are designers.\n\nThe content of running heads is primarily an editorial decision, rarely a design decision. When an editor hands over a manuscript for design, there should be a separate file with the contents for running heads. The appearance of running heads is primarily a design decision, often done in consultation with the editor.\n\npowers\n\n"

      "content": "I didn't read the Berry article, so if I repeat, forgive me. But I think Will has it about right, it is an editorial prerogative.\n\nBTW, in journals, the article title is often on the verso, author on the recto.\n\nWhen done best, the running heads often mirror the contents page. There are books where the A-level subheads are listed in the contents. In such cases, the best running head structure would be chapter title on the verso, current A-head on the rightie.\n\nIf subheads aren't on the contents, but there are part titles (& they'd be on the contents page), then it would be part title on the verso, CT on the recto.\n\nThe contents page and running heads work best as a sort of mini-index, that is, helping the reader find what they are interested in in the book/journal. Seems to me a lot of contemporary editors forget this -- or I'm out-of-date again.\n\nRepeating the book title for 300 pages sort of implies you think the reader is too stupid to be reading the book anyway. But come to think on it, that's how a lot of editors seem to feel, so maybe it is appropriate.\n\nYMMV\n\n"

I doubt that the magazine sections would be suitable to binding, but never having seen any, I cannot attest to this.\n\n"

In a few pages readers will be accustomed to its placement, and when they need folios they'll find them with no problem. Don't make too much of a scientific quest out of this question.\n\nI have seen single-folio spreads with folios in just about every conceivable position. I doubt readers had trouble finding them. With the exception of the following:\n\nOne always wants to be wary of placing folios too close into the bind gutter. Depending on how the book is bound, you risk losing folios in the bind. & if the book is ever re-bound, good-bye folios.\n\npowers\n\n"
