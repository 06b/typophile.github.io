  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm looking for an opentype testsheet (indesign or worddoc?) with which I can check a font I'm working on in various language settings and which shows the exotic characters (foreign languages, Math Characters etc) in real context. Probably as everyone else, I'm having a hard time designing and spacing characters which I don't know their exact use.  \nIs there something like this available?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
