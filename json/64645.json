  "content": "Im a Design student doing a rebranding/packaging project. The brand I'm doing this project with is Tetra. They make home aquarium/pond products and fish/reptile food. This is the logo I've made:  \n [http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/7357/logost.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804105348/http:/img514.imageshack.us/img514/7357/logost.jpg \"http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/7357/logost.jpg\")\n\nThe concept has to do with water, growth, fluidity, scales, movement, and fish.  \nMy problem is now I'm having problems picking a complimentary font to use on the packaging. It needs to follow the same concepts(especially fluidity), but not be too similar to the logo type. Any suggestions? I've really hit the wall on this one.\n\n",
