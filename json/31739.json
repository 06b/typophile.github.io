(I currently dont have the time and the nerves to maintain those domains, and keep the directory beyond alive. Still I would be happy if I knew that some type and design related individual would be continuing to use the domain, no matter what for.)\n\nSo, If anyone of you is interested in purchasing/owning these domains, please say so. :)\n\nThank you,  \nDav\n\n",
